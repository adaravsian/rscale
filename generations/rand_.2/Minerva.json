  "Step 1:  First, we need to understand the given problem. We are dealing with the Magellan telescopes, each with a diameter of $6.5 \\mathrm{~m}$. The effective focal length in one configuration is $72 \\mathrm{~m}$. We are asked to find the diameter of the image of a planet at this focus, given that the angular diameter of the planet is $45^{\\prime \\prime}$.\nStep 2:  To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of angular diameter and the relationship between the angular diameter, the diameter of the telescope, and the focal length.\nStep 3:  The angular diameter of the planet is given as $45^{\\prime \\prime}$, which is equivalent to $45 \\times 10^{-6}$ radians. We can use this value to find the diameter of the image of the planet at the focus of the telescope.\nStep 4:  The formula to find the diameter of the image is given by $d_{\\text {image }}=\\frac{D_{\\text {telescope }}}{f} \\theta$, where $D_{\\text {telescope }}$ is the diameter of the telescope, $f$ is the focal length, and $\\theta$ is the angular diameter of the planet.\nStep 5:  We are given that the diameter of the telescope is $6.5 \\mathrm{~m}$, the focal length is $72 \\mathrm{~m}$, and the angular diameter of the planet is $45^{\\prime \\prime}$.\nStep 6:  We can substitute these values into the formula to find the diameter of the image of the planet at the focus of the telescope.\nStep 7:  First, we need to convert the angular diameter from seconds of arc to radians. $45^{\\prime \\prime}$ is equivalent to $45 \\times 10^{-6}$ radians.\nStep 8:  Now, we can use the formula to find the diameter of the image: $d_{\\text {image }}=\\frac{6.5 \\mathrm{~m}}{72 \\mathrm{~m}} \\times 45 \\times 10^{-6}$.\nStep 9:  We can simplify this expression to find the diameter of the image in meters.\nStep 10:  After finding the diameter in meters, we need to convert it to centimeters by multiplying by $100$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the diameter of the image of the planet at the focus of the telescope is $d_{\\text {image }}=\\frac{6.5 \\mathrm{~m}}{72 \\mathrm{~m}} \\times 45 \\times 10^{-6} \\times 100$.\nStep 12:  By simplifying this expression, we can find the final answer in centimeters.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0.0000003125}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to calculate the luminosity of the white dwarf star, which is treated as a blackbody radiator.\nStep 2:  The luminosity of a blackbody radiator is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the luminosity (power output) is proportional to the fourth power of the effective temperature of the object.\nStep 3:  The formula for the luminosity of a blackbody is $L = 4 \\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$, where $L$ is the luminosity, $R$ is the radius of the object, $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the effective temperature.\nStep 4:  We are given the effective temperature of the white dwarf as $T_{e}=50,000$ degrees Kelvin and its radius as $R_{\\mathrm{WD}}=10^{4} \\mathrm{~km}$.\nStep 5:  First, we need to convert the radius from kilometers to meters, as the Stefan-Boltzmann constant is typically given in units of $\\mathrm{W/m^2K^4}$.\nStep 6:  The radius in meters is $R_{\\mathrm{WD}}=10^{4} \\mathrm{~km} \\times 10^{3} \\mathrm{~m/km} = 10^{7} \\mathrm{~m}$.\nStep 7:  Next, we need to convert the effective temperature from degrees Kelvin to Celsius, as the Stefan-Boltzmann constant is typically given in units of $\\mathrm{W/m^2K^4}$.\nStep 8:  The effective temperature in Celsius is $T_{e}=50,000 \\mathrm{~K} - 273.15 = 47,726.85 \\mathrm{~C}$.\nStep 9:  However, we don't need to convert the temperature to Celsius, as the Stefan-Boltzmann constant is given in units of $\\mathrm{W/m^2K^4}$, and we can directly use the temperature in Kelvin.\nStep 10:  Now, we can plug in the values into the formula for luminosity: $L = 4 \\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$.\nStep 11:  The Stefan-Boltzmann constant is $\\sigma = 5.670367(13) \\times 10^{-8} \\mathrm{~W/m^2K^4}$.\nStep 12:  Plugging in the values, we get $L = 4

Mathematically, this is expressed as $n_1 \\sin{\\theta_1} = n_2 \\sin{\\theta_2}$, where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the indices of refraction of the first and second media, respectively, and $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$ are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.\n\n## Step 2: Apply Snell's law to the given problem\nIn this problem, the light is incident on the water surface at an angle $\\theta_w$ with respect to the surface normal. The index of refraction of water is given as $n=1.3$. We want to find the angle of the light once it emerges from the water into the air, $\\theta_a$. Using Snell's law, we have $1.3 \\sin{\\theta_w} = \\sin{\\theta_a}$.\n\n## Step 3: Solve for $\\theta_a$\nTo find $\\theta_a$, we need to isolate $\\sin{\\theta_a}$ in the equation. Dividing both sides by 1.3, we get $\\sin{\\theta_a} = \\frac{1.3 \\sin{\\theta_w}}{1.3} = \\sin{\\theta_w}$. However, this is not correct. The correct solution is $\\sin{\\theta_a} = \\frac{1}{1.3} \\sin{\\theta_w}$. So $\\theta_a = \\arcsin{\\frac{1}{1.3} \\sin{\\theta_w}}$.\n\n## Step 4: Find the critical angle\nThe critical angle is the critical value of $\\theta_w$ such that the light will not emerge from the water. This occurs when $\\sin{\\theta_a} = 1$, since the light is totally internally reflected. Using Snell's law, we have $1.3 \\sin{\\theta_w} = 1$. Solving for $\\theta_w$, we get $\\sin{\\theta_w} = \\frac{1}{1.3}$. So $\\theta_w = \\arcsin{\\frac{1}{1.3}}$.\n\n## Step 5: Write the final answer\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\arcsin{\\frac{1}{1.3}}}$.\n\nThe final answer is:

  "Step 1:  To find the theoretical limiting angular resolution of the telescope, we can use the Rayleigh criterion, which states that the minimum angle between two point sources that can be resolved is given by $\\theta = 1.22 \\frac{\\lambda}{D}$, where $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of light and $D$ is the diameter of the telescope.\nStep 2:  Given that the diameter of the telescope is 8 inches, we need to convert this to meters to match the units of the wavelength. Since $1 \\mathrm{~inch} = 2.54 \\mathrm{~cm}$, we have $8 \\mathrm{~inches} = 8 \\times 2.54 \\mathrm{~cm} = 20.32 \\mathrm{~cm} = 0.2032 \\mathrm{~m}$.\nStep 3:  The wavelength of light is given as $\\lambda = 5000 \\AA = 500 \\mathrm{~nm} = 5 \\times 10^{-5} \\mathrm{~cm} = 5 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~m}$.\nStep 4:  Now, we can substitute these values into the Rayleigh criterion formula to find the limiting angular resolution.\nStep 5:  Plugging in the values, we get $\\theta = 1.22 \\frac{5 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~m}}{0.2032 \\mathrm{~m}}$.\nStep 6:  Simplifying this expression, we have $\\theta = 1.22 \\times 2.45 \\times 10^{-5} = 2.99 \\times 10^{-5} \\mathrm{~radians}$.\nStep 7:  To convert this to arcseconds, we use the conversion factor $1 \\mathrm{~radian} = 206265 \\mathrm{~arcseconds}$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, $\\theta = 2.99 \\times 10^{-5} \\mathrm{~radians} \\times 206265 \\mathrm{~arcseconds/radian} = 6.17 \\mathrm{~arcseconds}$.\nStep 9:  Rounding this to two significant figures, we get $\\theta \\approx 6.2 \\mathrm{~arcseconds}$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the theoretical limiting angular resolution of the telescope is approximately $6.2 \\mathrm{~arcseconds}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6.2}$",
  "Problem: A star has a measured parallax of $0.01^{\\prime \\prime}$, that is, $0.01$ arcseconds. How far away is it, in parsecs? Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the parallax of a star and its distance from us.\nStep 2:  The parallax of a star is the angle of view from Earth to the star, measured in arcseconds. It is defined as the angle subtended by the radius of the Earth's orbit around the Sun, which is about 1 AU (astronomical unit), at a distance of 1 parsec.\nStep 3:  The distance to the star in parsecs is the reciprocal of the parallax in arcseconds. This means that if the parallax is $p$ arcseconds, the distance is $1/p$ parsecs.\nStep 4:  In this problem, the parallax of the star is given as $0.01^{\\prime \\prime}$, which is $0.01$ arcseconds.\nStep 5:  To find the distance in parsecs, we take the reciprocal of the parallax: $1/0.01 = 100$ parsecs.\nStep 6:  Therefore, the star is $100$ parsecs away.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{100}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of magnitude and how it relates to the brightness of celestial objects.\nStep 2:  The magnitude of an object is a measure of its brightness, with lower magnitudes indicating brighter objects. The magnitude scale is logarithmic, meaning that a difference of 1 magnitude corresponds to a change in brightness by a factor of 2.5.\nStep 3:  We are given that the planet has a surface area that is $2 \\%$ of that of its parent star. This means that the planet's surface area is $0.02$ times the surface area of the star.\nStep 4:  Since the planet is dark, it contributes essentially no light of its own, so the total light coming from the system during transit is the light from the star minus the light blocked by the planet.\nStep 5:  The light blocked by the planet is proportional to its surface area, so the fraction of light blocked is $0.02$.\nStep 6:  Therefore, the decrease in magnitude of the system during transits is the magnitude of the star minus the magnitude of the system during transit, which is $0.02$ times the magnitude of the star.\nStep 7:  To find the decrease in magnitude, we need to calculate $0.02$ times the magnitude of the star.\nStep 8:  Since the magnitude scale is logarithmic, a decrease of $0.02$ times the magnitude of the star corresponds to a decrease of $0.02 \\times 2.5 = 0.05$ magnitudes.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the decrease in magnitude of the system during transits is $0.05$ magnitudes.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0.05}$",

Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between absolute magnitude, apparent magnitude, and luminosity. The absolute magnitude of a star is a measure of its intrinsic brightness, while the apparent magnitude is the brightness as seen from Earth. The difference between the two is related to the distance of the star from us.\nStep 2:  The formula to relate absolute magnitude (M) and apparent magnitude (m) is given by: $M = m - 5\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{d}{10}\\right)$, where d is the distance to the star in parsecs.

Since the Sun's absolute magnitude is $+5$, and the apparent magnitude of the star is $0$, we can use the formula: $M = m - 5\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{d}{10}\\right)$, but we don't have the distance. However, we can use the fact that the Sun's absolute magnitude is $+5$ and the star's apparent magnitude is $0$ to find the ratio of their luminosities.\nStep 8:  The ratio of their luminosities is equal to the ratio of their absolute magnitudes: $\\frac{L_{\\text{star}}}{L_{\\text{Sun}}} = 10^{0.4(M_{\\text{star}} - M_{\\text{Sun}})}$.\nStep 9:  Since the Sun's absolute magnitude is $+5$, and the star's apparent magnitude is $0$, we can find the star's absolute magnitude: $M_{\\text{star}} = m_{\\text{star}} - 5\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{d}{10}\\right)$. However, we don't have the distance, so we can't find the absolute magnitude directly.\nStep 10:  However, we can use the fact that the Sun's absolute magnitude is $+5$ and the star's apparent magnitude is $0$ to find the ratio of their luminosities: $\\frac{L_{\\text{star}}}{L_{\\text{Sun}}} = 10^{0.4(m_{\\text{star}} - m_{\\text{Sun}})}$.\nStep 11:  Since the Sun's absolute magnitude is $+5$, and the star's apparent magnitude is $0$, we can find the ratio of their luminosities: $\\frac{L_{\\text{star}}}{L_{\\text{Sun}}} = 10^{0.4(0 - (-5))} = 10^{0.4(5)} = 10^{2} = 100$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the luminosity of the star is $100$ times the luminosity of the Sun.\nStep 13:  The luminosity of the Sun is $3.83 \\times 10^{33}$ ergs/s, so the luminosity of the star is $100 \\times 3.83 \\times 10^{33} = 3.83 \\times 10^{35}$ ergs/s.\nStep 14:  Therefore, the luminosity of the star with apparent magnitude $0$ is $3.83 \\times 10^{35}$ ergs/s.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3.83 \\times 10^{35}}",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first understand the given parameters and the relationship between the mass of the black hole and the orbital period and radius of the star.\nStep 2:  The orbital period of the star is given as 15 years, and the orbital radius is $0.12$ seconds of arc. We are also given that the distance to the Galactic center is $8 \\mathrm{kpc}$.\nStep 3:  We are asked to compute the mass of the black hole, expressed as a ratio of masses between this black hole and our Sun, to 1 significant figure.\nStep 4:  We can start by using the formula $F=m a$, where $F$ is the gravitational force, $m$ is the mass of the black hole, and $a$ is the acceleration of the star.\nStep 5:  We know that the gravitational force is given by Newton's law of gravity, $F = G \\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$, where $G$ is the gravitational constant, $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses of the two objects, and $r$ is the distance between them.\nStep 6:  Since the star is orbiting the black hole, we can use the formula for centripetal force, $F = \\frac{m v^2}{r}$, where $m$ is the mass of the star, $v$ is its velocity, and $r$ is the orbital radius.\nStep 7:  We can equate the two expressions for $F$ and solve for the mass of the black hole, $m$.\nStep 8:  We will need to use the given parameters, such as the orbital period, orbital radius, and distance to the Galactic center, to calculate the mass of the black hole.\nStep 9:  We will also need to convert the given parameters to the appropriate units and perform the necessary calculations to obtain the mass of the black hole.\n\nStep 10:  First, we need to convert the orbital period from years to seconds, as the orbital radius is given in seconds of arc.\nStep 11:  We can use the conversion factor $1 \\mathrm{year} = 3.15 \\times 10^7 \\mathrm{seconds}$ to convert the orbital period from years to seconds.\nStep 12:  The orbital period is given as 15 years, so we can convert it to seconds as follows:\nStep 13:  $15 \\mathrm{years} \\times 3.15 \\times 10^7 \\mathrm{seconds/year} = 4.725 \\times 10^8 \\mathrm{seconds}$\n\nStep 14:  Next, we need to convert the orbital radius from seconds of arc to meters.\nStep 15:  We can use the conversion factor $1 \\mathrm{second} \\mathrm{of} \\mathrm{arc} = 4.848 \\times 10^{-6} \\mathrm{radians}$ to convert the orbital radius from seconds of arc to radians.\nStep 16:  We can then use the conversion factor $1 \\mathrm{radian} = 1 \\mathrm{meter} / \\mathrm{distance}$ to convert the orbital radius from radians to meters.\nStep 17:  The orbital radius is given as $0.12$ seconds of arc, so we can convert it to radians as follows:\nStep 18:  $0.12 \\mathrm{seconds} \\mathrm{of} \\mathrm{arc} \\times 4.848 \\times 10^{-6} \\mathrm{radians/second} \\mathrm{of} \\mathrm{arc} = 5.808 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{radians}$\nStep 19:  We can then convert the orbital radius from radians to meters as follows:\nStep 20:  $5.808 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{radians} \\times 8 \\mathrm{kpc} = 4.65 \\times 10^{16} \\mathrm{meters}$\n\nStep 21:  Now, we can use the formula $F = G \\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$ to calculate the gravitational force between the star and the black hole.\nStep 22:  We can use the given parameters, such as the orbital period, orbital radius, and distance to the Galactic center, to calculate the gravitational force.\nStep 23:  We can then use the formula $F = m a$ to calculate the acceleration of the star.\nStep 24:  We can then use the formula $a = \\frac{v^2}{r}$ to calculate the velocity of the star.\nStep 25:  We can then use the formula $v = \\frac{2 \\pi r}{T}$ to calculate the velocity of the star.\nStep 26:  We can then use the formula $m = \\frac{F}{a}$ to calculate the mass of the black hole.\nStep 27:  We can then use the formula $m = \\frac{G m_1 m_2}{r^2}$ to calculate the mass of the black hole.\nStep 28:  We can then use the given parameters, such as the orbital period, orbital radius, and distance to the Galactic center, to calculate the mass of the black hole.\n\nStep 29:  First, we can calculate the velocity of the star using the formula $v = \\frac{2 \\pi r}{T}$.\nStep 30:  We can use the given parameters, such as the orbital period and orbital radius, to calculate the velocity of the star.\nStep 31:  The orbital period is given as $4.725 \\times 10^8 \\mathrm{seconds}$, and the orbital radius is given as $4.65 \\times 10^{16} \\mathrm{meters}$.\nStep 32:  We can calculate the velocity of the star as follows:\nStep 33:  $v = \\frac{2 \\pi \\times 4.65 \\times 10^{16} \\mathrm{meters}}{4.725 \\times 10^8 \\mathrm{seconds}} = 3.95 \\times 10^8 \\mathrm{meters/second}$\n\nStep 34:  Next, we can calculate the acceleration of the star using the formula $a = \\frac{v^2}{r}$.\nStep 35:  We can use the calculated velocity and orbital radius to calculate the acceleration of the star.\nStep 36:  The velocity of the star is given as $3.95 \\times 10^8 \\mathrm{meters/second}$, and the orbital radius is given as $4.65 \\times 10^{16} \\mathrm{meters}$.\nStep 37:  We can calculate the acceleration of the star as follows:\nStep 38:  $a = \\frac{(3.95 \\times 10^8 \\mathrm{meters/second})^2}{4.65 \\times 10^{16} \\mathrm{meters}} = 3.35 \\times 10^{-8} \\mathrm{meters/second}^2$\n\nStep 39:  Now, we can calculate the mass of the black hole using the formula $m = \\frac{F}{a}$.\nStep 40:  We can use the calculated gravitational force and acceleration to calculate the mass of the black hole.\nStep 41:  The gravitational force is given by $F = G \\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$, where $G$ is the gravitational constant, $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses of the two objects, and $r$ is the distance between them.\nStep 42:  We can use the given parameters, such as the orbital period, orbital radius, and distance to the Galactic center, to calculate the gravitational force.\nStep 43:  The orbital period is given as $4.725 \\times 10^8 \\mathrm{seconds}$, the orbital radius is given as $4.65 \\times 10^{16} \\mathrm{meters}$, and the distance to the Galactic center is given as $8 \\mathrm{kpc}$.\nStep 44:  We can calculate the gravitational force as follows:\nStep 45:  $F = G \\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} = 6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\mathrm{N} \\mathrm{m}^2 \\mathrm{kg}^{-2} \\times \\frac{m_1 m_2}{(4.65 \\times 10^{16} \\mathrm{meters})^2}$\nStep 46:  We can then calculate the mass of the black hole as follows:\nStep 47:  $m = \\frac{F}{a} = \\frac{6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\mathrm{N} \\mathrm{m}^2 \\mathrm{kg}^{-2} \\times \\frac{m_1 m_2}{(4.65 \\times 10^{16} \\mathrm{meters})^2}}{3.35 \\times 10^{-8} \\mathrm{meters/second}^2}$\nStep 48:  We can then simplify the expression to obtain the mass of the black hole.\n\nStep 49:  After simplifying the expression, we can calculate the mass of the black hole as follows:\nStep 50:  $m = \\frac{6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\mathrm{N} \\mathrm{m}^2 \\mathrm{kg}^{-2} \\times \\frac{m_1 m_2}{(4.65 \\times 10^{16} \\mathrm{meters})^2}}{3.35 \\times 10^{-8} \\mathrm{meters/second}^2} = 2.3 \\times 10^{36} \\mathrm{kg}$\n\nStep 51:  Finally, we can express the mass of the black hole as a ratio of masses between this black hole and our Sun.\nStep 52:  The mass of the Sun is given as $1.989 \\times 10^{30} \\mathrm{kg}$.\nStep 53:  We can calculate the ratio of masses as follows:\nStep 54:  $\\frac{m}{M_{Sun}} = \\frac{2.3 \\times 10^{36} \\mathrm{kg}}{1.989 \\times 10^{30} \\mathrm{kg}} = 1.2 \\times 10^6$\n\nStep 55:  Therefore, the mass of the black hole is $1.2 \\times 10^6$ times the mass of the Sun.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1.2 \\times 10^6}$",
  "Step 1:  To find the luminosity of the star, we first need to understand the given information and the concepts involved. The star is located in the galaxy M31 at a distance of $800 \\mathrm{kpc}$, which is a unit of distance in the kiloparsec (kpc) scale. The star's temperature is given as $T = 6 \\times 10^{5} K$, and it produces a flux of $10^{-12} \\mathrm{erg} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ at the Earth. We are asked to find the luminosity of the star in units of $\\mathrm{erg} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\nStep 2:  The luminosity of a star is defined as the total energy emitted per unit time. To find the luminosity, we can use the formula $L = 4 \\pi r^2 F$, where $L$ is the luminosity, $r$ is the distance to the star, and $F$ is the flux at the Earth.\nStep 3:  However, we need to convert the given flux from $\\mathrm{erg} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ to $\\mathrm{erg} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\mathrm{cm}^{-2} \\mathrm{Hz}^{-1}$, which is the flux per unit frequency. This is because the luminosity is typically expressed in terms of the energy emitted per unit time per unit frequency.\nStep 4:  We can use the formula $F = \\frac{E}{4 \\pi r^2 \\Delta t}$, where $E$ is the energy emitted, $r$ is the distance, and $\\Delta t$ is the time interval. We can rearrange this formula to solve for $E$ and then use it to find the luminosity.\nStep 5:  Additionally, we need to consider the surface area of the star, which is given by $A = 4 \\pi R^2$, where $R$ is the radius of the star. We can use the temperature and radius to find the surface area and then use it to find the luminosity.\nStep 6:  We can use the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the energy radiated per unit surface area per unit time is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature. This law can be expressed as $E = \\sigma T^4 A$, where $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the temperature, and $A$ is the surface area.\nStep 7:  We can use the given temperature and surface area to find the energy radiated per unit surface area per unit time, and then use it to find the luminosity.\nStep 8:  We can also use the formula $L = \\frac{E}{\\Delta t}$, where $E$ is the energy emitted and $\\Delta t$ is the time interval.

Mathematically, this is represented as $\\frac{d P}{d z}=-\\rho g$, where $g$ is the gravitational acceleration.\nStep 4:  We are given that the atmosphere is sufficiently thin compared to the radius $R$ of the star, so we can assume that the gravitational acceleration is constant.\nStep 5:  We need to use the polytropic equation of state to express the density $\\rho$ in terms of pressure $P$ and then substitute this expression into the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium to derive the pressure as a function of height $z$.\nStep 6:  We are also given that the pressure at the surface is $P_{0}$, so we need to find the pressure at any height $z$ above the surface.\nStep 7:  To do this, we can start by expressing the density $\\rho$ in terms of pressure $P$ using the polytropic equation of state, which gives us $\\rho=\\left(\\frac{P}{K}\\right)^{3 / 5}$.\nStep 8:  Then, we can substitute this expression for $\\rho$ into the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium, which gives us $\\frac{d P}{d z}=-\\left(\\frac{P}{K}\\right)^{3 / 5} g$.\nStep 9:  We can then solve this differential equation to find the pressure $P$ as a function of height $z$.\nStep 10:  Finally, we can use the boundary condition that the pressure at the surface is $P_{0}$ to find the pressure at any height $z$ above the surface.\n\nStep 11:  Now, let's proceed with the calculations.\n\nStep 12:  First, we express the density $\\rho$ in terms of pressure $P$ using the polytropic equation of state:\n$\\rho=\\left(\\frac{P}{K}\\right)^{3 / 5}$\n\nStep 13:  Then, we substitute this expression for $\\rho$ into the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium:\n$\\frac{d P}{d z}=-\\left(\\frac{P}{K}\\right)^{3 / 5} g$\n\nStep 14:  We can then solve this differential equation to find the pressure $P$ as a function of height $z$.\n\nStep 15:  To solve the differential equation, we can separate the variables and integrate both sides:\n$\\frac{d P}{P^{3 / 5}}=-\\frac{g}{K^{3 / 5}} d z$\n\nStep 16:  Integrating both sides gives us:\n$\\int \\frac{d P}{P^{3 / 5}}=-\\frac{g}{K^{3 / 5}} \\int d z$\n\nStep 17:  Evaluating the integrals gives us:\n$\\frac{5}{2} P^{-2 / 5}=-\\frac{g}{K^{3 / 5}} z+C$\n\nStep 18:  Rearranging the equation to solve for $P$ gives us:\n$P^{-2 / 5}=\\frac{2 g}{5 K^{3 / 5}} z-\\frac{2 C}{5}$\n\nStep 19:  Taking the reciprocal of both sides gives us:\n$P=\\left(\\frac{2 g}{5 K^{3 / 5}} z-\\frac{2 C}{5}\\right)^{-5 / 2}$\n\nStep 20:  We can then use the boundary condition that the pressure at the surface is $P_{0}$ to find the value of $C$.\n\nStep 21:  At the surface, $z=0$, so we have:\n$P_{0}=\\left(-\\frac{2 C}{5}\\right)^{-5 / 2}$\n\nStep 22:  Solving for $C$ gives us:\n$C=-\\frac{5 P_{0}^{2 / 5}}{2}$\n\nStep 23:  Substituting this value of $C$ back into the equation for $P$ gives us:\n$P=\\left(\\frac{2 g}{5 K^{3 / 5}} z+\\frac{5 P_{0}^{2 / 5}}{2}\\right)^{-5 / 2}$\n\nStep 24:  Therefore, the pressure as a function of height $z$ above the surface of the planet is given by:\n$P=\\left(\\frac{2 g}{5 K^{3 / 5}} z+\\frac{5 P_{0}^{2 / 5}}{2}\\right)^{-5 / 2}$\n\nStep 25:  This is the final expression for the pressure as a function of height $z$.\n\nStep 26:  Now, let's write the final answer in the required format.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{2 g}{5 K^{3 / 5}} z+\\frac{5 P_{0}^{2 / 5}}{2}\\right)^{-5 / 2}}",

The orbital speed is the speed at which a test star orbits the galaxy at a given radius $r$, while the angular velocity is the rate of change of the angle with respect to time as the star orbits.\nStep 2:  The orbital speed $v(r)$ is given by the rotation curve equation:\n\\[\nv(r)=\\frac{\\left(\\frac{r}{r_{0}}\\right)}{\\left(1+\\frac{r}{r_{0}}\\right)^{3 / 2}} v_{0}\n\\]\nStep 3:  We know that the angular velocity $\\omega$ is related to the orbital speed $v$ by the equation $\\omega = \\frac{v}{r}$, where $r$ is the radius of the orbit.\nStep 4:  Therefore, to find $\\omega(r)$, we can substitute the expression for $v(r)$ into the equation $\\omega = \\frac{v}{r}$.\nStep 5:  Substituting $v(r)$ into the equation $\\omega = \\frac{v}{r}$ gives us:\n\\[\n\\omega(r) = \\frac{v(r)}{r} = \\frac{\\frac{\\left(\\frac{r}{r_{0}}\\right)}{\\left(1+\\frac{r}{r_{0}}\\right)^{3 / 2}} v_{0}}{r}\n\\]\nStep 6:  Simplifying the expression for $\\omega(r)$, we get:\n\\[\n\\omega(r) = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{r}{r_{0}}\\right)}{\\left(1+\\frac{r}{r_{0}}\\right)^{3 / 2}} \\frac{v_{0}}{r}\n\\]\nStep 7:  Further simplifying, we can cancel out the $r$ terms:\n\\[\n\\omega(r) = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{1}{r_{0}}\\right)}{\\left(1+\\frac{r}{r_{0}}\\right)^{3 / 2}}\n\\]\nStep 8:  Therefore, the expression for $\\omega(r)$ is:\n\\[\n\\omega(r) = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{1}{r_{0}}\\right)}{\\left(1+\\frac{r}{r_{0}}\\right)^{3 / 2}}\n\\]\nStep 9:  So, the final expression for $\\omega(r)$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{\\left(\\frac{1}{r_{0}}\\right)}{\\left(1+\\frac{r}{r_{0}}\\right)^{3 / 2}}}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the absolute magnitude of a star, its distance from us, and its apparent magnitude.\nStep 2:  The absolute magnitude of a star is a measure of its intrinsic brightness, and it is defined as the apparent magnitude the star would have if it were at a distance of 10 parsecs (pc) from us. The absolute magnitude of the Sun is given as +5.\nStep 3:  The apparent magnitude of a star is a measure of its brightness as seen from Earth, and it depends on the distance of the star from us.

The apparent magnitude of the cluster would be the same as the apparent magnitude of a single star at the same distance, which is +5. But since the cluster is made up of many stars, we need to consider the effect of the number of stars on the apparent magnitude.\nStep 10:  The apparent magnitude of a cluster of stars is related to the number of stars and their individual magnitudes. However, in this case, since the absolute magnitude of the stars is the same as that of the Sun, and the distance is the same, the apparent magnitude of the cluster would be the same as the apparent magnitude of a single star at the same distance, which is +5.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the combined apparent magnitude of the cluster is still +5.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$",

This means that the luminosity of star 1 is $2.5^2 = 6.25$ times larger than the luminosity of star 2, since luminosity is proportional to the square of the radius.\nStep 5:  Since the luminosities are the same, the absolute magnitudes are the same, so $M_1 = M_2$.\nStep 6:  We need to find the apparent magnitude of each star, and then find the absolute value of the difference between them.\nStep 7:  The apparent magnitude of star 1 is $m_1 = M + 5\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{d_1}{d_0}\\right)$, and the apparent magnitude of star 2 is $m_2 = M + 5\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{d_2}{d_0}\\right)$.\nStep 8:  Since $d_1 = 10d_2$, we have $\\frac{d_1}{d_0} = 10\\frac{d_2}{d_0}$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, $m_1 = M + 5\\log_{10}\\left(10\\frac{d_2}{d_0}\\right) = M + 5\\log_{10}\\left(10\\right) + 5\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{d_2}{d_0}\\right) = M + 5 + 5\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{d_2}{d_0}\\right)$.\nStep 10:  Similarly, $m_2 = M + 5\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{d_2}{d_0}\\right)$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the difference in apparent magnitude is $m_1 - m_2 = (M + 5 + 5\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{d_2}{d_0}\\right)) - (M + 5\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{d_2}{d_0}\\right)) = 5$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the absolute value of the difference in apparent magnitude is $|m_1 - m_2| = |5| = 5$.\nStep 13:  Rounding to the nearest integer, we get $|m_1 - m_2| = \\boxed{5}$",
  "Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem asks for the slope of a curve that represents the relationship between the number of objects observed per square degree on the sky ($N$) and the flux at the observer ($F$), both expressed in logarithmic form, for a homogeneous distribution of objects with luminosity $L$.\n\nStep 2: Recall the relationship between flux and luminosity\nThe flux $F$ at the observer is related to the luminosity $L$ of an object and its distance $d$ by the formula $F = \\frac{L}{4\\pi d^2}$.\n\nStep 3: Express the relationship between $N$ and $F$ in logarithmic form\nSince $N$ is the number of objects observed per square degree, and $F$ is the flux at the observer, we can express their relationship in logarithmic form as $\\log N = \\log N(>F)$.\n\nStep 4: Use the luminosity function to relate $N$ and $F$\nThe luminosity function $\\phi(L)$ describes the distribution of luminosities among objects. For a homogeneous distribution, $\\phi(L)$ is constant. The number of objects observed per square degree with flux greater than $F$ is given by $N(>F) = \\int_{L(F)}^{\\infty} \\phi(L) dL$, where $L(F)$ is the luminosity corresponding to flux $F$.\n\nStep 5: Express $L(F)$ in terms of $F$\nFrom the formula $F = \\frac{L}{4\\pi d^2}$, we can express $L$ in terms of $F$ as $L = 4\\pi d^2 F$.\n\nStep 6: Substitute $L(F)$ into the expression for $N(>F)$\nSubstituting $L(F) = 4\\pi d^2 F$ into the expression for $N(>F)$, we get $N(>F) = \\int_{4\\pi d^2 F}^{\\infty} \\phi(L) dL$.\n\nStep 7: Take the logarithm of $N(>F)$\nTaking the logarithm of $N(>F)$, we get $\\log N(>F) = \\log \\int_{4\\pi d^2 F}^{\\infty} \\phi(L) dL$.\n\nStep 8: Use the properties of logarithms to simplify the expression\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we can simplify the expression to $\\log N(>F) = \\log \\int_{4\\pi d^2 F}^{\\infty} \\phi(L) dL = \\log \\int_{4\\pi d^2 F}^{\\infty} \\phi(4\\pi d^2 F) dF$.\n\nStep 9: Use the fact that $\\phi(L)$ is constant for a homogeneous distribution\nSince $\\phi(L)$ is constant for a homogeneous distribution, we can write $\\phi(L) = \\phi(4\\pi d^2 F) = \\phi_0$, where $\\phi_0$ is a constant.\n\nStep 10: Simplify the expression for $\\log N(>F)$\nSubstituting $\\phi(L) = \\phi_0$ into the expression for $\\log N(>F)$, we get $\\log N(>F) = \\log \\int_{4\\pi d^2 F}^{\\infty} \\phi_0 dF = \\log \\phi_0 \\int_{4\\pi d^2 F}^{\\infty} dF$.\n\nStep 11: Evaluate the integral\nEvaluating the integral, we get $\\int_{4\\pi d^2 F}^{\\infty} dF = \\frac{1}{4\\pi d^2} \\int_{4\\pi d^2 F}^{\\infty} dL = \\frac{1}{4\\pi d^2} \\left[ L \\right]_{4\\pi d^2 F}^{\\infty} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi d^2} \\left[ \\infty -

  "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem describes a system of two tanks, each with a volume of $V$ liters, where a saline solution is added to the first tank at a rate of $r$ liters/minute and then flows into the second tank. The second tank also has an outflow at the same rate of $r$ liters/minute. We need to write down a differential equation for the amount of salt in the second tank as a function of time, given the amount of salt in the first tank at time $t$.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the variables and parameters\nLet $x(t)$ be the amount of salt in the first tank at time $t$, and $y(t)$ be the amount of salt in the second tank at time $t$. The parameters are $V$ (volume of each tank), $r$ (inflow and outflow rate), and $c$ (concentration of saline solution).\n\n## Step 3: Write down the differential equation for the first tank\nThe differential equation for the amount of salt in the first tank is given by:\n\\[\nx^{\\prime}+\\frac{r}{V} x-r c=0\n\\]\nThis equation represents the rate of change of salt in the first tank, taking into account the inflow of saline solution and the outflow of solution.\n\n## Step 4: Write down the differential equation for the second tank\nSince the second tank receives the outflow from the first tank, the amount of salt in the second tank at time $t$ is given by $y(t) = x(t)$. The differential equation for the amount of salt in the second tank is:\n\\[\ny^{\\prime}+\\frac{r}{V} y-r c=0\n\\]\nHowever, since the second tank also has an outflow at the same rate of $r$ liters/minute, we need to take into account the rate of change of salt in the second tank due to this outflow.\n\n## Step 5: Correct the differential equation for the second tank\nSince the second tank receives the outflow from the first tank, the amount of salt in the second tank at time $t$ is given by $y(t) = x(t)$. However, the differential equation for the second tank should take into account the rate of change of salt in the second tank due to the outflow. Since the outflow rate is $r$ liters/minute, the rate of change of salt in the second tank due to the outflow is $-r \\frac{y}{V}$. Therefore, the correct differential equation for the second tank is:\n\\[\ny^{\\prime}+\\frac{r}{V} y-r \\frac{y}{V}-r c=0\n\\]\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\\[\ny^{\\prime}+\\frac{r}{V} y-r c=0\n\\]\nHowever, this is the same equation as the differential equation for the first tank. Since the second tank receives the outflow from the first tank, the amount of salt in the second tank at time $t$ is given by $y(t) = x(t)$. Therefore, the differential equation for the second tank should be:\n\\[\ny^{\\prime}=\\frac{r}{V} x-r c\n\\]\nThis equation represents the rate of change of salt in the second tank, taking into account the inflow of salt from the first tank and the outflow of solution.\n\n## Step 6: Write down the final differential equation for the second tank\nThe final differential equation for the amount of salt in the second tank is:\n\\[\ny^{\\prime}=\\frac{r}{V} x-r c\n\\]\nThis equation represents the rate of change of salt in the second tank, taking into account the inflow of salt from the first tank and the outflow of solution.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{y^{\\prime}=\\frac{r}{V} x-r c}",

This suggests that the equation can be written as $\\frac{d}{d x}(x^{2} y)=\\sin (2 x)$.\nStep 2:  We can then proceed to solve the equation by integrating both sides with respect to $x$. This gives us $x^{2} y=\\int \\sin (2 x) d x$. We can evaluate the integral on the right-hand side to obtain $x^{2} y=-\\frac{1}{2} \\cos (2 x)+c_{1}$, where $c_{1}$ is the constant of integration.\nStep 3:  To find the general solution, we need to solve for $y$.

However, there is no term for $\\dot{x}$, so $b=0$.\n\nStep 4: Since there is no term for $\\dot{x}$, the coefficient $m$ is not explicitly given. However, we can assume that $m=1$ since the equation is in the form $\\ddot{x}+\\omega^{2} x=0$, which implies that the coefficient of $\\ddot{x}$ is 1.\n\nStep 5: Now that we have identified the coefficients $m, b$, and $k$, we can write the characteristic polynomial $p(s)$ as $p(s)=m s^{2}+b s+k$.

We are given the equation $R \\dot{I} + \\frac{1}{C} I = \\dot{V}$, where $I(t)$ is the current, $V(t)$ is the voltage increase across the voltage source, $R$ is the resistance, and $C$ is the capacitance.\nStep 2:  We are told that the voltage $V$ is constant, so $V(t) = V_0$. We need to solve for $I(t)$ with the initial condition $I(0)$.\nStep 3:  To solve this differential equation, we first need to isolate the term involving $I$ and $\\dot{I}$. We can do this by moving the $\\dot{V}$ term to the other side of the equation.\nStep 4:  The equation becomes $R \\dot{I} + \\frac{1}{C} I = \\dot{V}$. Since $V$ is constant, $\\dot{V} = 0$.

  "Step 1:  To find the complex gain $H(\\omega)$ of the system, we first need to understand the system's response to a sinusoidal input signal $F_{\\text {ext }}(t)=A \\cos (\\omega t)$.\nStep 2:  The system is described by the differential equation $m \\ddot{x}+b \\dot{x}+k x=F_{\\text {ext }}$, where $m=1, b=\\frac{1}{4}$, and $k=2$.

  "Let $x(t)$ be the number of grams of salt in the tank at time $t$. The rate of change of salt in the tank is the rate at which salt enters the tank minus the rate at which salt leaves the tank. The rate at which salt enters the tank is the concentration of the saline solution times the rate at which the solution is added, which is $c \\cdot r$ grams/minute. The rate at which salt leaves the tank is the concentration of the solution in the tank times the rate at which the solution is removed, which is $\\frac{x(t)}{V} \\cdot r$ grams/minute. Therefore, the differential equation for the amount of salt in the tank is \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{dx}{dt} &= c \\cdot r - \\frac{x(t)}{V} \\cdot r\\\\\n&= r \\left( c - \\frac{x(t)}{V} \\right).\n\\end{align*}This is a linear differential equation in standard form, with $x(t)$ as the dependent variable and $t$ as the independent variable.

  "Problem: Find the polynomial solution of $\\ddot{x}-x=t^{2}+t+1$, solving for $x(t)$.\nTo solve the differential equation $\\ddot{x}-x=t^{2}+t+1$, we can use the method of undetermined coefficients. This method is used to find a particular solution to a nonhomogeneous linear differential equation.\n\nFirst, we need to find the complementary solution, which is the solution to the homogeneous equation $\\ddot{x}-x=0$. This is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients.\n\nThe characteristic equation is $r^2 - 1 = 0$, which has roots $r = \\pm 1$. Therefore, the complementary solution is $x_c(t) = c_1e^t + c_2e^{-t}$.\n\nNext, we need to find a particular solution, $x_p(t)$, which is a solution to the nonhomogeneous equation $\\ddot{x}-x=t^{2}+t+1$. Since the right-hand side is a polynomial of degree 2, we assume that $x_p(t)$ is a polynomial of degree 2 or less.\n\nLet $x_p(t) = at^2 + bt + c$. Then, $\\dot{x_p}(t) = 2at + b$ and $\\ddot{x_p}(t) = 2a$.\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the nonhomogeneous equation, we get:\n\n$2a - (at^2 + bt + c) = t^2 + t + 1$\n\nEquating coefficients of like powers of $t$, we get:\n\n$-a = 1$ (coefficient of $t^2$)\n\n$-b = 1$ (coefficient of $t$)\n\n$-c = 1$ (constant term)\n\nSolving these equations, we get:\n\n$a = -1$\n\n$b = -1$\n\n$c = -1$\n\nTherefore, the particular solution is $x_p(t) = -t^2 - t - 1$.\n\nThe general solution is the sum of the complementary solution and the particular solution:\n\n$x(t) = x_c(t) + x_p(t) = c_1e^t + c_2e^{-t} - t^2 - t - 1$\n\nTo find the values of $c_1$ and $c_2$, we need initial conditions. However, the problem does not specify initial conditions, so we cannot determine the values of $c_1$ and $c_2$.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is $x(t) = c_1e^t + c_2e^{-t} - t^2 - t - 1$.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{c_1e^t + c_2e^{-t} - t^2 - t - 1}",

Step 1:  To find a purely sinusoidal solution of the given differential equation $\\frac{d^{4} x}{d t^{4}}-x=\\cos (2 t)$, we first need to understand the nature of the equation and the type of solution we are looking for.\nStep 2:  The equation is a fourth-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients, and we are looking for a solution of the form $x(t) = e^{st}$, where $s$ is a complex number.\nStep 3:  Substituting $x(t) = e^{st}$ into the differential equation, we get the characteristic equation $s^4 - 1 = 0$.\nStep 4:  The characteristic equation is a quartic equation, and we need to find its roots to determine the general form of the solution.\nStep 5:  The roots of the characteristic equation are the values of $s$ that satisfy the equation $s^4 - 1 = 0$.\nStep 6:  We can factor the characteristic equation as $(s^2 - 1)(s^2 + 1) = 0$.\nStep 7:  This gives us two quadratic factors: $s^2 - 1 = 0$ and $s^2 + 1 = 0$.\nStep 8:  Solving the first quadratic factor, we get $s^2 - 1 = 0 \\Rightarrow s^2 = 1 \\Rightarrow s = \\pm 1$.\nStep 9:  Solving the second quadratic factor, we get $s^2 + 1 = 0 \\Rightarrow s^2 = -1 \\Rightarrow s = \\pm i$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the roots of the characteristic equation are $s = 1, -1, i, -i$.\nStep 11:  Since the roots are distinct, the general solution of the differential equation is given by $x(t) = c_1 e^{t} + c_2 e^{-t} + c_3 e^{it} + c_4 e^{-it}$.\nStep 12:  However, we are looking for a purely sinusoidal solution, so we need to express the solution in terms of sine and cosine functions.\nStep 13:  Using Euler's formula, we can express $e^{it}$ and $e^{-it}$ in terms of sine and cosine functions as $e^{it} = \\cos t + i \\sin t$ and $e^{-it} = \\cos t - i \\sin t$.\nStep 14:  Substituting these expressions into the general solution, we get $x(t) = c_1 e^{t} + c_2 e^{-t} + c_3 (\\cos t + i \\sin t) + c_4 (\\cos t - i \\sin t)$.\nStep 15:  Simplifying the expression, we get $x(t) = (c_1 + c_3 + c_4) e^{t} + (c_2 + c_3 - c_4) e^{-t} + (c_3 + c_4) \\cos t + i (c_3 - c_4) \\sin t$.\nStep 16:  Since we are looking for a purely sinusoidal solution, we need to eliminate the exponential terms.\nStep 17:  To do this, we can set $c_1 = c_2 = 0$ and $c_3 = c_4 = 1$.\nStep 18:  Substituting these values into the expression, we get $x(t) = 0 + 0 + 2 \\cos t + i (1 - 1) \\sin t$.\nStep 19:  Simplifying the expression, we get $x(t) = 2 \\cos t$.\nStep 20:  Therefore, a purely sinusoidal solution of the differential equation is $x(t) = 2 \\cos t$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",

  "Problem: Find a solution of $\\ddot{x}+4 x=\\cos (2 t)$, solving for $x(t)$, by using the ERF on a complex replacement. The ERF (Exponential Response Formula) states that a solution to $p(D) x=A e^{r t}$ is given by $x_{p}=A \\frac{e^{r t}}{p(r)}$, as long as $\\left.p (r\\right) \\neq 0$). The ERF with resonance assumes that $p(r)=0$ and states that a solution to $p(D) x=A e^{r t}$ is given by $x_{p}=A \\frac{t e^{r t}}{p^{\\prime}(r)}$, as long as $\\left.p^{\\prime} ( r\\right) \\neq 0$. Step 1:  The problem asks us to find a solution to the differential equation $\\ddot{x}+4 x=\\cos (2 t)$ using the Exponential Response Formula (ERF) with a complex replacement.\nStep 2:  The ERF states that a solution to $p(D) x=A e^{r t}$ is given by $x_{p}=A \\frac{e^{r t}}{p(r)}$, as long as $\\left.p (r)\\right. \\neq 0$. However, in this case, we have a resonance, which means $p(r)=0$. In such cases, the ERF with resonance states that a solution to $p(D) x=A e^{r t}$ is given by $x_{p}=A \\frac{t e^{r t}}{p^{\\prime}(r)}$, as long as $\\left.p^{\\prime} (r)\\right. \\neq 0$.\nStep 3:  To apply the ERF with resonance, we need to find the complex roots of the characteristic equation $p(r)=r^2+4=0$. This gives us $r=\\pm 2 i$. Since $p(r)=0$, we have a resonance at $r=2 i$.\nStep 4:  The derivative of $p(r)$ is $p^{\\prime}(r)=2 r$. Substituting $r=2 i$ into $p^{\\prime}(r)$ gives us $p^{\\prime}(2 i)=4 i$.\nStep 5:  Now, we can use the ERF with resonance to find the solution. The solution is given by $x_{p}=A \\frac{t e^{r t}}{p^{\\prime}(r)}$. Substituting $r=2 i$ and $p^{\\prime}(2 i)=4 i$ into the solution gives us $x_{p}=A \\frac{t e^{2 i t}}{4 i}$.\nStep 6:  To simplify the solution, we can use Euler's formula, which states that $e^{i \\theta}=\\cos \\theta+i \\sin \\theta$. Substituting $r=2 i$ into Euler's formula gives us $e^{2 i t}=\\cos (2 t)+i \\sin (2 t)$.\nStep 7:  Substituting $e^{2 i t}=\\cos (2 t)+i \\sin (2 t)$ into the solution gives us $x_{p}=A \\frac{t (\\cos (2 t)+i \\sin (2 t))}{4 i}$.\nStep 8:  Simplifying the solution further, we can use the fact that $i^2=-1$.

  "Step 1:  To solve the given ordinary differential equation (ODE) $\\ddot{x}-a^{2} x=0$, we first need to understand the nature of the equation and the initial conditions provided.\nStep 2:  The ODE is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients. It can be written in the form $\\ddot{x} - a^2x = 0$, where $\\ddot{x}$ represents the second derivative of $x$ with respect to $t$, and $a$ is a nonzero real-valued constant.\nStep 3:  The initial conditions given are $x(0) = 1$ and $\\dot{x}(0) = 0$. This means that at time $t = 0$, the value of $x$ is $1$, and the value of its first derivative, $\\dot{x}$, is $0$.\nStep 4:  To solve this ODE, we can use the method of undetermined coefficients or the characteristic equation method. However, given the initial conditions, we can also use the method of variation of parameters or the Laplace transform method.\nStep 5:  Since the ODE is linear and homogeneous, we can assume a solution of the form $x(t) = e^{rt}$, where $r$ is a constant to be determined. Substituting this into the ODE, we get the characteristic equation $r^2 - a^2 = 0$.\nStep 6:  Solving the characteristic equation, we find that $r = \\pm a$. Therefore, the general solution to the ODE is $x(t) = c_1 e^{at} + c_2 e^{-at}$, where $c_1$ and $c_2$ are arbitrary constants.\nStep 7:  To find the specific solution that satisfies the initial conditions, we use the initial conditions $x(0) = 1$ and $\\dot{x}(0) = 0$.\nStep 8:  Substituting $t = 0$ into the general solution, we get $x(0) = c_1 + c_2 = 1$.\nStep 9:  Taking the derivative of the general solution, we get $\\dot{x}(t) = ac_1 e^{at} - ac_2 e^{-at}$.\nStep 10:  Substituting $t = 0$ into the derivative, we get $\\dot{x}(0) = ac_1 - ac_2 = 0$.\nStep 11:  Solving the system of equations $c_1 + c_2 = 1$ and $ac_1 - ac_2 = 0$, we find that $c_1 = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $c_2 = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the specific solution that satisfies the initial conditions is $x(t) = \\frac{1}{2} e^{at} + \\frac{1}{2} e^{-at}$.\nStep 13:  Simplifying the expression, we get $x(t) = \\cosh(at)$.\nStep 14:  Therefore, the solution to the ODE $\\ddot{x}-a^{2} x=0$ with initial conditions $x(0) = 1$ and $\\dot{x}(0)=0$ is $x(t) = \\cosh(at)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\cosh(at)}",

Using the partial fraction expansion method, we can write:\n\n\\[\nY(s) = \\frac{1}{s(\\tau s + 1)} = \\frac{A}{s} + \\frac{B}{\\tau s + 1}\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), we get:\n\n\\[\nA = 1\n\\]\n\n\\[\nB = -\\frac{1}{\\tau}\n\\]\n\nStep 8: Inverse Laplace transform\nTaking the inverse Laplace transform of the partial fraction expansion, we get:\n\n\\[\ny(t) = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\tau}e^{-t/\\tau}\n\\]\n\nStep 9: Determine the settling time\nThe settling time is the time it takes for the output to settle within an error \\(\\pm \\Delta\\) from the final value of 1.

Make sure to clearly show the steps in your calculation.\nStep 1:  The problem asks us to find the Laplace transform of the given signal \\(x(t)\\), which is defined as\n\\[\nx(t)=\\left(e^{-t}-e^{-1}\\right)\\left(u_{s}(t)-u_{s}(t-1)\\right)\n\\]\nTo find the Laplace transform \\(X(s)\\), we need to apply the properties of the Laplace transform to the given signal.\n\nStep 2:  The signal \\(x(t)\\) is a product of two functions: \\(\\left(e^{-t}-e^{-1}\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(u_{s}(t)-u_{s}(t-1)\\right)\\). We can use the property of the Laplace transform that states the transform of a product of two functions is the convolution of their individual transforms.\n\nStep 3:  First, let's find the Laplace transform of the function \\(\\left(e^{-t}-e^{-1}\\right)\\). This function can be expressed as a difference of two exponential functions, which can be transformed using the standard Laplace transform formulas.\n\nStep 4:  The Laplace transform of \\(e^{-t}\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{s+1}\\), and the Laplace transform of a constant \\(e^{-1}\\) is \\(\\frac{e^{-1}}{s}\\). Therefore, the Laplace transform of \\(\\left(e^{-t}-e^{-1}\\right)\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{s+1}-\\frac{e^{-1}}{s}\\).\n\nStep 5:  Next, let's find the Laplace transform of the function \\(\\left(u_{s}(t)-u_{s}(t-1)\\right)\\). This function is a unit step function shifted by 1 second, which can be expressed as a difference of two unit step functions.\n\nStep 6:  The Laplace transform of a unit step function \\(u_{s}(t)\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{s}\\), and the Laplace transform of a shifted unit step function \\(u_{s}(t-1)\\) is \\(e^{-s}\\frac{1}{s}\\). Therefore, the Laplace transform of \\(\\left(u_{s}(t)-u_{s}(t-1)\\right)\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{s}-e^{-s}\\frac{1}{s}\\).\n\nStep 7:  Now, we can find the Laplace transform of the product of these two functions using the convolution property. The convolution of two functions in the time domain corresponds to the product of their Laplace transforms in the frequency domain.\n\nStep 8:  Therefore, the Laplace transform of the product of \\(\\left(e^{-t}-e^{-1}\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(u_{s}(t)-u_{s}(t-1)\\right)\\) is the convolution of their individual transforms.\n\nStep 9:  The convolution of \\(\\frac{1}{s+1}-\\frac{e^{-1}}{s}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{s}-e^{-s}\\frac{1}{s}\\) can be calculated using the convolution property.\n\nStep 10:  The convolution of two functions \\(f(s)\\) and \\(g(s)\\) is given by the integral of \\(f(s)g(\\tau)e^{-s\\tau}d\\tau\\).\n\nStep 11:  Therefore, the Laplace transform of the product of \\(\\left(e^{-t}-e^{-1}\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(u_{s}(t)-u_{s}(t-1)\\right)\\) is the convolution of \\(\\frac{1}{s+1}-\\frac{e^{-1}}{s}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{s}-e^{-s}\\frac{1}{s}\\).\n\nStep 12:  After calculating the convolution, we get the Laplace transform of the product as \\(\\frac{1}{s(s+1)}-\\frac{e^{-1}}{s(s+1)}-\\frac{e^{-s}}{s(s+1)}+\\frac{e^{-1}e^{-s}}{s(s+1)}\\).\n\nStep 13:  Simplifying the expression, we get the Laplace transform of the product as \\(\\frac{1-e^{-1}-e^{-s}+e^{-1}e^{-s}}{s(s+1)}\\).\n\nStep 14:  Therefore, the Laplace transform of the signal \\(x(t)\\) is \\(\\frac{1-e^{-1}-e^{-s}+e^{-1}e^{-s}}{s(s+1)}\\).\n\nStep 15:  This is the final answer for the Laplace transform of the given signal \\(x(t)\\).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1-e^{-1}-e^{-s}+e^{-1}e^{-s}}{s(s+1)}}$",

This involves expressing the function as a sum of simpler fractions, which will make it easier to find the inverse Laplace transform.\nStep 3:  We start by expressing $F(s)$ as a sum of three partial fractions: $\\frac{A}{s} + \\frac{B}{s+2} + \\frac{C}{s+5}$.\nStep 4:  Multiplying both sides by the denominator $s(s+2)(s+5)$, we get $-4s+10 = A(s+2)(s+5) + Bs(s+5) + Cs(s+2)$.\nStep 5:  We then select suitable values of $s$ to solve for the coefficients $A$, $B$, and $C$. Setting $s=0$, we get $10 = 2A$, so $A = 5$. Setting $s=-2$, we get $-4(-2)+10 = -2B$, so $B = 6$. Setting $s=-5$, we get $-4(-5)+10 = -5C$, so $C = 2$.\nStep 6:  Therefore, we have $F(s) = -\\frac{5}{s} + \\frac{6}{s+2} + \\frac{2}{s+5}$.\nStep 7:  Now, we can find the inverse Laplace transform of each term separately.\nStep 8:  The inverse Laplace transform of $\\frac{5}{s}$ is $5u(t)$, where $u(t)$ is the unit step function.\nStep 9:  The inverse Laplace transform of $\\frac{6}{s+2}$ is $6e^{-2t}u(t)$.\nStep 10:  The inverse Laplace transform of $\\frac{2}{s+5}$ is $2e^{-5t}u(t)$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the inverse Laplace transform of $F(s)$ is $-5u(t) + 6e^{-2t}u(t) + 2e^{-5t}u(t)$.\nStep 12:  So, the final answer is $-5u(t) + 6e^{-2t}u(t) + 2e^{-5t}u(t)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-5u(t) + 6e^{-2t}u(t) + 2e^{-5t}u(t)}",

However, in this case, it's more straightforward to recognize that the term \\(\\frac{a}{s(s+a)}\\) can be decomposed into partial fractions.\nStep 4:  The partial fraction decomposition of \\(\\frac{a}{s(s+a)}\\) is \\(\\frac{A}{s} + \\frac{B}{s+a}\\), where \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are constants to be determined.\nStep 5:  Multiplying both sides by \\(s(s+a)\\) to clear the denominators gives us \\(a = A(s+a) + Bs\\).\nStep 6:  Expanding the right-hand side gives us \\(a = As + aA + Bs\\).\nStep 7:  Combining like terms, we get \\(a = (A + B)s + aA\\).\nStep 8:  Equating coefficients of like terms on both sides, we get two equations: \\(A + B = 0\\) and \\(aA = a\\).\nStep 9:  From the second equation, we find \\(A = 1\\), and from the first equation, knowing \\(A = 1\\), we find \\(B = -1\\).\nStep 10:  Therefore, the partial fraction decomposition is \\(\\frac{1}{s} - \\frac{1}{s+a}\\).\nStep 11:  Now, we can rewrite the original function as \\(X(s) = b + \\frac{1}{s} - \\frac{1}{s+a}\\).\nStep 12:  The inverse Laplace transform of \\(\\frac{1}{s}\\) is \\(1\\), and the inverse Laplace transform of \\(\\frac{1}{s+a}\\) is \\(e^{-at}u(t)\\), where \\(u(t)\\) is the unit step function.\nStep 13:  Therefore, the inverse Laplace transform of \\(X(s)\\) is \\(x(t) = b + 1 - e^{-at}u(t)\\).\nStep 14:  Since \\(a, b > 0\\), and the region of convergence is \\(|s| > 0\\), the function is valid for \\(t > 0\\).\nStep 15:  Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{b + 1 - e^{-at}}",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the components of the RLC circuit and how they interact with the voltage source and the capacitor.\nStep 2:  The RLC circuit consists of a resistor $R$, an inductor $L$, and a capacitor $C$ connected in series with a voltage source $v_{i}$.\nStep 3:  We are interested in finding the transfer function $V_{o}(s) / V_{i}(s)$, which represents the ratio of the output voltage across the capacitor $v_{o}$ to the input voltage $v_{i}$.\nStep 4:  The transfer function is a mathematical representation of the relationship between the input and output of a system, in this case, the RLC circuit.\nStep 5:  To find the transfer function, we need to analyze the circuit and determine the relationship between the input voltage $v_{i}$ and the output voltage $v_{o}$.\nStep 6:  We can start by considering the circuit as a series circuit, where the voltage across each component is the same.\nStep 7:  The voltage across the resistor $R$ is $v_{R} = iR$, where $i$ is the current flowing through the circuit.\nStep 8:  The voltage across the inductor $L$ is $v_{L} = L\\frac{di}{dt}$, where $\\frac{di}{dt}$ is the rate of change of current.\nStep 9:  The voltage across the capacitor $C$ is $v_{C} = \\frac{1}{C}\\int i dt$, where $\\int i dt$ is the integral of the current over time.\nStep 10:  The total voltage across the circuit is the sum of the voltages across each component, $v_{i} = v_{R} + v_{L} + v_{C}$.\nStep 11:  We can now use Kirchhoff's voltage law to relate the voltages across each component to the input voltage $v_{i}$.\nStep 12:  Kirchhoff's voltage law states that the sum of the voltages around a closed loop is zero, so $v_{i} = v_{R} + v_{L} + v_{C}$.\nStep 13:  Substituting the expressions for $v_{R}$, $v_{L}$, and $v_{C}$, we get $v_{i} = iR + L\\frac{di}{dt} + \\frac{1}{C}\\int i dt$.\nStep 14:  We can now use the Laplace transform to find the transfer function $V_{o}(s) / V_{i}(s)$.\nStep 15:  The Laplace transform of a function $f(t)$ is defined as $F(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} f(t)e^{-st} dt$.\nStep 16:  We can apply the Laplace transform to the differential equation $v_{i} = iR + L\\frac{di}{dt} + \\frac{1}{C}\\int i dt$.\nStep 17:  Taking the Laplace transform of both sides, we get $V_{i}(s) = I(s)R + sLI(s) + \\frac{1}{Cs}I(s)$.\nStep 18:  We can now solve for $I(s)$, the Laplace transform of the current $i$.\nStep 19:  Rearranging the equation, we get $I(s) = \\frac{V_{i}(s)}{R + sL + \\frac{1}{Cs}}$.\nStep 20:  The transfer function $V_{o}(s) / V_{i}(s)$ is the ratio of the output voltage $V_{o}(s)$ to the input voltage $V_{i}(s)$.\nStep 21:  Since the output voltage $V_{o}(s)$ is the voltage across the capacitor, we can write $V_{o}(s) = \\frac{1}{Cs}I(s)$.\nStep 22:  Substituting the expression for $I(s)$, we get $V_{o}(s) = \\frac{1}{Cs}\\frac{V_{i}(s)}{R + sL + \\frac{1}{Cs}}$.\nStep 23:  Simplifying the expression, we get $V_{o}(s) = \\frac{V_{i}(s)}{RCs^2 + sL + 1}$.\nStep 24:  Therefore, the transfer function $V_{o}(s) / V_{i}(s)$ is $\\frac{1}{RCs^2 + sL + 1}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{RCs^2 + sL + 1}}",

  "Step 1:  To find the governing differential equation for the circuit, we need to understand the components involved and how they interact with each other.\nStep 2:  The circuit consists of a voltage source $v_{i}(t)$ connected in series with an inductor $L$ and a capacitor $C$. The output of the system is the voltage across the capacitor, denoted as $v_{o}(t)$.\nStep 3:  We know that the voltage across the inductor is given by $L\\frac{di}{dt}$, where $i$ is the current through the inductor. Similarly, the voltage across the capacitor is given by $\\frac{1}{C}\\int i dt$.\nStep 4:  Since the voltage source $v_{i}(t)$ is connected in series with the inductor and capacitor, the voltage across the inductor and capacitor is the same as the voltage across the source, which is $v_{i}(t)$.\nStep 5:  Therefore, we can write the equation for the voltage across the inductor as $L\\frac{di}{dt} = v_{i}(t)$, and the equation for the voltage across the capacitor as $\\frac{1}{C}\\int i dt = v_{i}(t)$.\nStep 6:  Since the voltage across the capacitor is the output of the system, we can write the governing differential equation as $\\frac{1}{C}\\int i dt = v_{o}(t)$.\nStep 7:  To find the differential equation, we need to differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time $t$.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of special relativity and how it applies to Manny's situation.\nStep 2:  Manny is running towards first base at a speed $\\beta$, and he sees third base $45^{\\circ}$ to his left. This means that the direction of third base has changed for him due to his motion.\nStep 3:  In special relativity, the speed of an object is relative to the observer. Manny's speed $\\beta$ is the speed at which he is moving relative to the ground, and we need to find the speed at which he is moving relative to the third base.\nStep 4:  Since Manny sees third base $45^{\\circ}$ to his left, it means that the direction of third base has been rotated by $45^{\\circ}$ for him. This is equivalent to saying that the third base is now at an angle of $45^{\\circ}$ to his direction of motion.\nStep 5:  In special relativity, the speed of an object is given by the Lorentz transformation, which relates the speed of an object in one frame to its speed in another frame.\nStep 6:  The Lorentz transformation for the x-component of velocity is given by $v_x' = \\frac{v_x - u}{1 - \\frac{uv_x}{c^2}}$, where $v_x'$ is the velocity in the new frame, $v_x$ is the velocity in the original frame, $u$ is the relative velocity between the two frames, and $c$ is the speed of light.\nStep 7:  In this case, the original frame is the ground, and the new frame is Manny's frame. The velocity $v_x$ is the speed at which Manny is moving relative to the ground, and $u$ is the speed at which Manny is moving relative to the third base.\nStep 8:  Since Manny sees third base $45^{\\circ}$ to his left, the angle between his direction of motion and the direction to third base is $45^{\\circ}$. This means that the relative velocity $u$ is equal to the speed at which Manny is moving relative to the third base, which is $\\beta$.\nStep 9:  Plugging in the values, we get $v_x' = \\frac{\\beta - \\beta}{1 - \\frac{\\beta^2}{c^2}} = 0$. This means that Manny sees the third base at rest, which is consistent with his perception of the third base being $45^{\\circ}$ to his left.\nStep 10:  However, this result is not what we want. We want to find the speed at which Manny is moving relative to the third base, not the speed at which the third base is moving relative to Manny.\nStep 11:  To find the speed at which Manny is moving relative to the third base, we need to use the Lorentz transformation for the x-component of velocity, but with the roles of the two frames reversed.\nStep 12:  In this case, the original frame is Manny's frame, and the new frame is the ground. The velocity $v_x'$ is the speed at which Manny is moving relative to the ground, and $v_x$ is the speed at which Manny is moving relative to the third base.\nStep 13:  Plugging in the values, we get $v_x = \\frac{v_x' + u}{1 + \\frac{uv_x'}{c^2}}$. Since Manny sees third base $45^{\\circ}$ to his left, the angle between his direction of motion and the direction to third base is $45^{\\circ}$. This means that the relative velocity $u$ is equal to the speed at which Manny is moving relative to the third base, which is $\\beta$.\nStep 14:  Plugging in the values, we get $v_x = \\frac{\\beta + \\beta}{1 + \\frac{\\beta^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{2\\beta}{1 + \\frac{\\beta^2}{c^2}}$.\nStep 15:  Simplifying, we get $v_x = \\frac{2\\beta c^2}{c^2 + \\beta^2}$.\nStep 16:  Therefore, the speed at which Manny is moving relative to the third base is $\\frac{2\\beta c^2}{c^2 + \\beta^2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{2\\beta c^2}{c^2 + \\beta^2}}",
  "Problem: Preamble: In the Sun, one of the processes in the He fusion chain is $p+p+e^{-} \\rightarrow d+\\nu$, where $d$ is a deuteron. Make the approximations that the deuteron rest mass is $2 m_{p}$, and that $m_{e} \\approx 0$ and $m_{\\nu} \\approx 0$, since both the electron and the neutrino have negligible rest mass compared with the proton rest mass $m_{p}$.\n\nIn the lab frame, the two protons have the same energy $\\gamma m_{p}$ and impact angle $\\theta$, and the electron is at rest. Calculate the energy $E_{\\nu}$ of the neutrino in the rest frame of the deuteron in terms of $\\theta, m_{p}$ and $\\gamma$. Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to consider the process $p+p+e^{-} \\rightarrow d+\\nu$ in the lab frame and then transform to the rest frame of the deuteron.\nStep 2:  We are given that the two protons have the same energy $\\gamma m_{p}$ and impact angle $\\theta$, and the electron is at rest. We also know that the deuteron rest mass is $2 m_{p}$, and the electron and neutrino have negligible rest mass compared with the proton rest mass $m_{p}$.\nStep 3:  First, we need to calculate the energy of the neutrino in the lab frame. Since the electron is at rest, the total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the two protons. Each proton has energy $\\gamma m_{p}$, so the total energy is $2 \\gamma m_{p}$.\nStep 4:  The momentum of each proton is $\\gamma m_{p} \\beta$, where $\\beta$ is the velocity of the proton. Since the protons have impact angle $\\theta$, the total momentum is $2 \\gamma m_{p} \\beta \\cos \\theta$.\nStep 5:  The energy of the neutrino in the lab frame is given by $E_{\\nu} = \\sqrt{m_{d}^2 + p_{\\nu}^2}$, where $m_{d}$ is the mass of the deuteron and $p_{\\nu}$ is the momentum of the neutrino.\nStep 6:  Since the deuteron rest mass is $2 m_{p}$, we have $m_{d} = 2 m_{p}$. The momentum of the neutrino is given by $p_{\\nu} = \\sqrt{E_{\\nu}^2 - m_{d}^2}$.\nStep 7:  We can use the conservation of energy and momentum to relate the energy of the neutrino in the lab frame to the energy of the protons and the electron.\nStep 8:  In the lab frame, the energy of the neutrino is $E_{\\nu} = \\sqrt{m_{d}^2 + p_{\\nu}^2}$.

  "Problem: A certain species of bacteria doubles in population every 10 hours. If there are 100 bacteria initially, how many bacteria will there be after 30 hours? [/INST] Step 1:  First, let's understand the problem. We have a species of bacteria that doubles in population every 10 hours. We start with 100 bacteria, and we want to know how many bacteria there will be after 30 hours.\nStep 2:  Since the bacteria double every 10 hours, we can calculate the number of times the population doubles in 30 hours. 30 hours divided by 10 hours per doubling gives us 3 doublings.\nStep 3:  To find the number of bacteria after 30 hours, we need to multiply the initial population by 2 for each doubling. So, we start with 100 bacteria, then double it 3 times.\nStep 4:  First doubling: 100 * 2 = 200 bacteria.\nStep 5:  Second doubling: 200 * 2 = 400 bacteria.\nStep 6:  Third doubling: 400 * 2 = 800 bacteria.\nStep 7:  Therefore, after 30 hours, there will be 800 bacteria.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{800}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the longest wavelength of light that has enough energy to eject electrons from a potassium photodiode surface.\nStep 2:  First, we need to calculate the energy required to eject one electron from the potassium surface. We are given that the energy needed is $2.15 \\times 10^{5} J$ per mole of electrons removed. Since 1 mole is $6.02 \\times 10^{23}$ electrons, we can calculate the energy required to eject one electron by dividing the total energy by the number of electrons in a mole.\nStep 3:  So, the energy required to eject one electron is $\\frac{2.15 \\times 10^{5} J}{6.02 \\times 10^{23}}$.\nStep 4:  Next, we need to find the longest wavelength of light that has enough energy to eject electrons. We know that the energy of a photon is given by $E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$, where $h$ is Planck's constant, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of the light.\nStep 5:  We can rearrange this equation to solve for $\\lambda$, which gives us $\\lambda = \\frac{hc}{E}$.\nStep 6:  We can then substitute the values of $h$, $c$, and $E$ to find the longest wavelength of light that has enough energy to eject electrons.\nStep 7:  The energy required to eject one electron is $3.59 \\times 10^{-19} J$. We can then use the equation $\\lambda = \\frac{hc}{E}$ to find the longest wavelength of light that has enough energy to eject electrons.\nStep 8:  Substituting the values of $h$, $c$, and $E$, we get $\\lambda = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} J s)(3.00 \\times 10^{8} m/s)}{3.59 \\times 10^{-19} J}$.\nStep 9:  Solving this equation gives us the longest wavelength of light that has enough energy to eject electrons from a potassium photodiode surface.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the longest wavelength of light that has enough energy to eject electrons is $\\lambda = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} J s)(3.00 \\times 10^{8} m/s)}{3.59 \\times 10^{-19} J}$.\nStep 11:  After performing the calculation, we find that the longest wavelength of light that has enough energy to eject electrons is $\\lambda = 3.49 \\times 10^{-7} m$.\nStep 12:  To convert this to nanometers, we multiply by $10^{9}$, giving us $\\lambda = 349 nm$.\nStep 13:  Therefore, the longest wavelength of light that has enough energy to eject electrons from a potassium photodiode surface is $\\boxed{349}$ nm.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{349}$",

Therefore, $\\lambda = 6.7102 \\times 10^{-5} cm \\times 10^{-2} m/cm = 6.7102 \\times 10^{-7} m$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the frequency using the formula $v = c / \\lambda$\nThe speed of light is $c = 2.9979 \\times 10^{8} m/s$. The wavelength is $\\lambda = 6.7102 \\times 10^{-7} m$.

  "Step 1:  First, we need to recall the formula that relates the wavelength of light to its frequency. The formula is given by $v = \\frac{c}{\\lambda}$, where $v$ is the frequency, $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum, and $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of the light.\nStep 2:  The speed of light in vacuum is a fundamental constant and is approximately $3.00 \\times 10^8$ meters per second. However, the wavelength given is in centimeters, so we need to convert it to meters to match the units of the speed of light.\nStep 3:  The wavelength given is $6.7102 \\times 10^{-5}$ centimeters. To convert this to meters, we divide by 100 since there are 100 centimeters in a meter. So, $\\lambda = 6.7102 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ cm} = 6.7102 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}$.\nStep 4:  Now, we can substitute the values of $c$ and $\\lambda$ into the formula $v = \\frac{c}{\\lambda}$ to find the frequency $v$.\nStep 5:  Plugging in the values, we get $v = \\frac{3.00 \\times 10^8}{6.7102 \\times 10^{-7}}$.\nStep 6:  To perform this division, we need to ensure that the exponents of the base 10 are the same. We can do this by adjusting the exponents so that the denominator's exponent is the negative of the numerator's exponent. This gives us $v = \\frac{3.00 \\times 10^8}{6.7102 \\times 10^{-7}} = \\frac{3.00 \\times 10^{8} \\times 10^{7}}{6.7102} = \\frac{3.00 \\times 10^{15}}{6.7102}$.\nStep 7:  Now, we can perform the division to find the frequency $v$.\nStep 8:  Dividing $3.00 \\times 10^{15}$ by $6.7102$, we get $v = 4.4743 \\times 10^{14}$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the frequency of the red light is $4.4743 \\times 10^{14}$ Hz, to 4 decimal places.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4.4743 \\times 10^{14}}",

Planck's constant is $6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{~J} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}$.\nStep 3:  We can calculate the energy of the photon using the formula $E = h \\nu$. Substituting the given values, we get $E = (6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{~J} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}) \\times (3.091 \\times 10^{14} \\mathrm{~Hz}) = 2.048 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{~J}$.\nStep 4:  Next, we need to convert the energy from joules to electronvolts (eV). We know that $1 \\mathrm{eV} = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{~J}$, so we can convert the energy as follows: $E = \\frac{2.048 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{~J}}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{~J/eV}} = 1.277 \\mathrm{eV}$.\nStep 5:  Now, we need to find the wavelength of the photoemission. We can use the formula $\\lambda = \\frac{hc}{E}$, where $\\lambda$ is the wavelength, $h$ is Planck's constant, $c$ is the speed of light, and $E$ is the energy of the photon.\nStep 6:  Substituting the values, we get $\\lambda = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{~J} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}) \\times (3.00 \\times 10^8 \\mathrm{~m/s})}{2.048 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{~J}} = 9.73 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~m}$.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the wavelength of photoemission generated by this interaction is $9.73 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{9.73 \\times 10^{-7}}",

This is because semiconductors have a finite band gap, which means that they require photons with energies in excess of a certain threshold (in this case, red light) to activate charge carriers.\n\n## Step 3: Estimate the band gap energy (Eg) for the material in eV.\nThe band gap energy is the energy required to excite an electron from the valence band to the conduction band. For a semiconductor, the band gap energy is typically in the range of 1-3 eV.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to use Bragg's Law, which relates the wavelength of the radiation, the interplanar spacing of the crystal lattice, and the angle of diffraction.\nStep 2:  First, we need to identify the given information: the radiation used is tungsten (W) $L_{\\alpha}$, and the specimen is thorium (Th). We also need to know the wavelength of the $L_{\\alpha}$ radiation and the interplanar spacing of the thorium crystal lattice.\nStep 3:  The wavelength of the $L_{\\alpha}$ radiation is given as 0.071 nm. The interplanar spacing of the thorium crystal lattice is given as 0.323 nm.\nStep 4:  We are asked to calculate the angle of the $4^{\\text {th }}$ reflection, denoted as $\\theta$.\nStep 5:  Bragg's Law is given by the equation $2d \\sin \\theta = n \\lambda$, where $d$ is the interplanar spacing, $\\theta$ is the angle of diffraction, $n$ is the order of reflection, and $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of the radiation.\nStep 6:  We can rearrange Bragg's Law to solve for $\\theta$: $\\sin \\theta = \\frac{n \\lambda}{2d}$.\nStep 7:  Plugging in the given values, we get $\\sin \\theta = \\frac{4 \\times 0.071}{2 \\times 0.323}$.\nStep 8:  Simplifying, we get $\\sin \\theta = \\frac{0.284}{0.646}$.\nStep 9:  Evaluating the expression, we get $\\sin \\theta = 0.44$.\nStep 10:  Taking the inverse sine of 0.44, we get $\\theta = \\sin^{-1}(0.44)$.\nStep 11:  Evaluating the inverse sine, we get $\\theta = 26.74^{\\circ}$.\nStep 12:  Rounding to 2 decimal places, we get $\\theta = 26.74^{\\circ}$.\nStep 13:  Therefore, the angle of the $4^{\\text {th }}$ reflection is $\\boxed{26.74}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given information and what is being asked. The metal has a Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) structure, a lattice constant of $3.31 \\AA$, and a density of $16.6 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{cm}^{3}$. We are tasked with determining the atomic weight of this element in g/mole, rounded to 1 decimal place.\nStep 2:  The first step is to calculate the volume of the unit cell. The lattice constant is given as $3.31 \\AA$, which is equivalent to $3.31 \\times 10^{-10} \\mathrm{~m}$. Since the BCC structure has a lattice constant of $a$, the volume of the unit cell is given by $V = a^3$.\nStep 3:  Substituting the given lattice constant, we get $V = (3.31 \\times 10^{-10} \\mathrm{~m})^3 = 3.31 \\times 10^{-30} \\mathrm{~m}^3$.\nStep 4:  Next, we need to calculate the mass of the unit cell. The density of the metal is given as $16.6 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{cm}^{3}$, which is equivalent to $16.6 \\times 10^3 \\mathrm{~kg} / \\mathrm{m}^3$. The mass of the unit cell is given by $m = \\rho V$, where $\\rho$ is the density and $V$ is the volume of the unit cell.\nStep 5:  Substituting the given density and volume, we get $m = (16.6 \\times 10^3 \\mathrm{~kg} / \\mathrm{m}^3) \\times (3.31 \\times 10^{-30} \\mathrm{~m}^3) = 5.49 \\times 10^{-26} \\mathrm{~kg}$.\nStep 6:  Since the unit cell contains 2 atoms (one at the center and 8 at the corners), the mass of one atom is given by $m_{\\text{atom}} = \\frac{m}{2}$.\nStep 7:  Substituting the mass of the unit cell, we get $m_{\\text{atom}} = \\frac{5.49 \\times 10^{-26} \\mathrm{~kg}}{2} = 2.745 \\times 10^{-26} \\mathrm{~kg}$.\nStep 8:  To find the atomic weight in g/mole, we need to convert the mass of one atom from kg to g and then multiply by Avogadro's number ($6.022 \\times 10^{23}$).\nStep 9:  Converting the mass of one atom from kg to g, we get $m_{\\text{atom}} = 2.745 \\times 10^{-26} \\mathrm{~kg} \\times \\frac{1 \\mathrm{~g}}{10^{-3} \\mathrm{~kg}} = 2.745 \\times 10^{-23} \\mathrm{~g}$.\nStep 10:  Multiplying by Avogadro's number, we get $m_{\\text{mole}} = 2.745 \\times 10^{-23} \\mathrm{~g} \\times 6.022 \\times 10^{23} = 16.5 \\mathrm{~g}$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the atomic weight of this element in g/mole is $16.5 \\mathrm{~g}$, rounded to 1 decimal place.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{16.5}$",
  "Problem: Preamble: Iron $\\left(\\rho=7.86 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{cm}^{3}\\right.$ ) crystallizes in a BCC unit cell at room temperature.\n\nCalculate the radius in cm of an iron atom in this crystal. Please format your answer as $n \\times 10^x$ where $n$ is to 2 decimal places. Step 1:  To find the radius of an iron atom in a BCC unit cell, we first need to understand the relationship between the radius of the atom and the lattice parameter (a) of the unit cell.\nStep 2:  In a BCC (Body-Centered Cubic) unit cell, the relationship between the radius of the atom (r) and the lattice parameter (a) is given by the equation: $a = \\frac{4r}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\nStep 3:  We are given the density of iron as $\\rho = 7.86 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ and the mass of a single iron atom as $m = 55.85 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\nStep 4:  The volume of the unit cell (V) can be calculated using the formula: $V = \\frac{a^3}{\\sqrt{2}}$ for a BCC unit cell.\nStep 5:  We can also express the volume of the unit cell in terms of the density and mass of the iron atom: $V = \\frac{m}{\\rho}$.\nStep 6:  Equating the two expressions for volume, we can solve for the lattice parameter (a) in terms of the radius (r) of the iron atom.\nStep 7:  Once we have the lattice parameter (a), we can use the equation $a = \\frac{4r}{\\sqrt{3}}$ to solve for the radius (r) of the iron atom.\nStep 8:  Finally, we can express the radius (r) in the required format as $n \\times 10^x$ where $n$ is to 2 decimal places.\n\nStep 9:  First, let's calculate the volume of the unit cell using the density and mass of the iron atom: $V = \\frac{m}{\\rho} = \\frac{55.85 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}}{7.86 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{cm}^{3}} = 7.11 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\nStep 10:  Since the unit cell contains 2 atoms (one at the center and 8 at the corners), the volume of the unit cell is: $V = \\frac{7.11 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3} / \\mathrm{mol}}{2} = 3.555 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\nStep 11:  Now, we can equate the two expressions for volume: $\\frac{a^3}{\\sqrt{2}} = 3.555 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\nStep 12:  Solving for $a^3$, we get: $a^3 = \\frac{3.555 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3} / \\mathrm{mol} \\times \\sqrt{2}}{1} = 5.016 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\nStep 13:  Taking the cube root of both sides, we get: $a = \\sqrt[3]{5.016 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3} / \\mathrm{mol}} = 1.62 \\mathrm{~cm}$.\nStep 14:  Now, we can use the equation $a = \\frac{4r}{\\sqrt{3}}$ to solve for the radius (r) of the iron atom: $1.62 \\mathrm{~cm} = \\frac{4r}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\nStep 15:  Solving for r, we get: $r = \\frac{1.62 \\mathrm{~cm} \\times \\sqrt{3}}{4} = 0.70 \\mathrm{~cm}$.\nStep 16:  Therefore, the radius of the iron atom in the BCC unit cell is $0.70 \\mathrm{~cm}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0.70 \\times 10^0}$",

  "Problem: Determine the wavelength of $\\lambda_{K_{\\alpha}}$ for molybdenum (Mo). Please format your answer as $n \\times 10^x$ where $n$ is to 2 decimal places, in meters.\n\n## Step 1: Identify the atomic number of molybdenum (Mo) to determine the energy level involved in the K-alpha transition.\nMolybdenum has an atomic number of 42, which means it has 42 electrons. The K-alpha transition involves the transition of an electron from the L shell (2nd energy level) to the K shell (1st energy level).\n\n## Step 2: Determine the energy difference between the L shell and the K shell for molybdenum.\nThe energy difference between the L shell and the K shell can be calculated using the formula: $\\Delta E = E_{L} - E_{K}$. However, since we are dealing with the K-alpha transition, we need to consider the energy difference between the L shell and the K shell, which is given by the energy of the K-alpha line.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the energy of the K-alpha line for molybdenum.\nThe energy of the K-alpha line can be calculated using the formula: $E_{K_{\\alpha}} = 13.6 \\times Z^2 \\times (1 - \\frac{1}{n_{L}^2}) - 13.6 \\times Z^2 \\times (1 - \\frac{1}{n_{K}^2})$, where $Z$ is the atomic number, $n_{L}$ is the principal quantum number of the L shell, and $n_{K}$ is the principal quantum number of the K shell.\n\n## Step 4: Plug in the values for molybdenum into the formula.\nFor molybdenum, $Z = 42$, $n_{L} = 2$, and $n_{K} = 1$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get: $E_{K_{\\alpha}} = 13.6 \\times 42^2 \\times (1 - \\frac{1}{2^2}) - 13.6 \\times 42^2 \\times (1 - \\frac{1}{1^2})$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the expression and calculate the energy of the K-alpha line.\nSimplifying the expression, we get: $E_{K_{\\alpha}} = 13.6 \\times 1764 \\times (1 - \\frac{1}{4}) - 13.6 \\times 1764 \\times (1 - 1)$. This simplifies to: $E_{K_{\\alpha}} = 13.6 \\times 1764 \\times \\frac{3}{4} - 0$. This further simplifies to: $E_{K_{\\alpha}} = 13.6 \\times 1323 - 0$. This equals: $E_{K_{\\alpha}} = 17955.8$ eV.\n\n## Step 6: Convert the energy of the K-alpha line from eV to Joules.\nTo convert eV to Joules, we use the conversion factor: $1 eV = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} J$. Therefore, $E_{K_{\\alpha}} = 17955.8 eV \\times 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} J/eV$.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the energy of the K-alpha line in Joules.\nMultiplying the energy in eV by the conversion factor, we get: $E_{K_{\\alpha}} = 17955.8 \\times 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} J = 2.879 \\times 10^{-15} J$.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the wavelength of the K-alpha line using the energy.\nThe wavelength of the K-alpha line can be calculated using the formula: $\\lambda = \\frac{hc}{E_{K_{\\alpha}}}$, where $h$ is Planck's constant, $c$ is the speed of light, and $E_{K_{\\alpha}}$ is the energy of the K-alpha line.\n\n## Step 9: Plug in the values for Planck's constant, the speed of light, and the energy of the K-alpha line into the formula.\nPlugging in the values, we get: $\\lambda = \\frac{6.626 \\times 10^{-34} J s \\times 3 \\times 10^8 m/s}{2.879 \\times 10^{-15} J}$.\n\n## Step 10: Simplify the expression and calculate the wavelength of the K-alpha line.\nSimplifying the expression, we get: $\\lambda = \\frac{19.878 \\times 10^{-26} J m}{2.879 \\times 10^{-15} J}$. This simplifies to: $\\lambda = 6.91 \\times 10^{-11} m$.\n\n## Step 11: Format the answer as $n \\times 10^x$ where $n$ is to 2 decimal places, in meters.\nThe wavelength of the K-alpha line for molybdenum is $6.91 \\times 10^{-11}$ m.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6.91 \\times 10^{-11}}",
  "Step 1:  To find the second-nearest neighbor distance for nickel (Ni) at $100^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, we first need to understand the given information and what is being asked. The density of nickel at $100^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ is given as $8.83 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{cm}^{3}$.\nStep 2:  The second-nearest neighbor distance in a crystal structure is related to the lattice parameters and the coordination number. However, without specific information about the crystal structure of nickel at $100^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, we'll assume a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure for nickel, which is a common structure for many metals.\nStep 3:  In an FCC structure, the first-nearest neighbors are the atoms directly adjacent to a given atom, and the second-nearest neighbors are the atoms that are two positions away in the lattice. The distance between the first-nearest neighbors is related to the lattice parameter (a) of the crystal.\nStep 4:  The lattice parameter (a) can be related to the density of the material using the formula: $\\rho = \\frac{Z \\cdot M}{N_A \\cdot a^3}$, where $\\rho$ is the density, $Z$ is the number of atoms per unit cell, $M$ is the molar mass of the material, $N_A$ is Avogadro's number, and $a$ is the lattice parameter.\nStep 5:  For an FCC structure, $Z = 4$ (since there are 4 atoms per unit cell in an FCC lattice).\nStep 6:  The molar mass of nickel (Ni) is approximately $58.6934 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\nStep 7:  Avogadro's number ($N_A$) is $6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$.\nStep 8:  Rearranging the formula to solve for $a$, we get: $a = \\left( \\frac{Z \\cdot M}{N_A \\cdot \\rho} \\right)^{1/3}$.\nStep 9:  Substituting the given values, we can calculate the lattice parameter $a$.\nStep 10:  Once we have the lattice parameter $a$, we can calculate the distance between the first-nearest neighbors using the formula: $d_{1NN} = a / \\sqrt{2}$.\nStep 11:  The distance between the second-nearest neighbors in an FCC structure is related to the first-nearest neighbor distance by the formula: $d_{2NN} = \\sqrt{2} \\cdot d_{1NN}$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, we can calculate the second-nearest neighbor distance using the first-nearest neighbor distance.\nStep 13:  After calculating the second-nearest neighbor distance, we need to convert it to picometers (pm) and express it in the required format $n \\times 10^x$ where $n$ is to 2 decimal places.\n\nStep 14:  Now, let's calculate the lattice parameter $a$ using the given density and the formula: $a = \\left( \\frac{Z \\cdot M}{N_A \\cdot \\rho} \\right)^{1/3}$.\nStep 15:  Substituting the values, we get: $a = \\left( \\frac{4 \\cdot 58.6934 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}}{6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\mathrm{~mol}^{-1} \\cdot 8.83 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{cm}^3} \\right)^{1/3}$.\nStep 16:  Calculating the value inside the parentheses, we get: $a = \\left( \\frac{4 \\cdot 58.6934}{6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\cdot 8.83} \\right)^{1/3}$.\nStep 17:  Simplifying further, we get: $a = \\left( \\frac{234.7736}{5.310 \\times 10^{25}} \\right)^{1/3}$.\nStep 18:  Evaluating the expression inside the parentheses, we get: $a = \\left( 4.412 \\times 10^{-25} \\right)^{1/3}$.\nStep 19:  Taking the cube root, we get: $a = 1.83 \\times 10^{-8} \\mathrm{~cm}$.\nStep 20:  Converting the lattice parameter to picometers (pm), we get: $a = 1.83 \\times 10^{-8} \\mathrm{~cm} \\cdot 10^{10} \\mathrm{~pm} / \\mathrm{cm} = 1.83 \\times 10^{2} \\mathrm{~pm}$.\n\nStep 21:  Now, let's calculate the first-nearest neighbor distance using the formula: $d_{1NN} = a / \\sqrt{2}$.\nStep 22:  Substituting the value of $a$, we get: $d_{1NN} = 1.83 \\times 10^{2} \\mathrm{~pm} / \\sqrt{2}$.\nStep 23:  Evaluating the expression, we get: $d_{1NN} = 1.29 \\times 10^{2} \\mathrm{~pm}$.\n\nStep 24:  Finally, let's calculate the second-nearest neighbor distance using the formula: $d_{2NN} = \\sqrt{2} \\cdot d_{1NN}$.\nStep 25:  Substituting the value of $d_{1NN}$, we get: $d_{2NN} = \\sqrt{2} \\cdot 1.29 \\times 10^{2} \\mathrm{~pm}$.\nStep 26:  Evaluating the expression, we get: $d_{2NN} = 1.82 \\times 10^{2} \\mathrm{~pm}$.\n\nStep 27:  Therefore, the second-nearest neighbor distance for nickel (Ni) at $100^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ is $1.82 \\times 10^{2} \\mathrm{~pm}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1.82 \\times 10^{2}}",
  "Problem: What is the working temperature for silica glass in Celsius?\nSilica glass, also known as fused silica or quartz glass, is a type of glass that is made from silicon dioxide (SiO2). It is known for its high purity, thermal stability, and resistance to chemical corrosion. The working temperature for silica glass in Celsius is typically around 1200\u00b0C to 1400\u00b0C. This temperature range is often used for various applications, including the production of optical components, semiconductor manufacturing, and laboratory equipment. However, the exact working temperature can vary depending on the specific application and the desired properties of the glass. For example, in some cases, the working temperature may be as high as 1600\u00b0C or as low as 1000\u00b0C, depending on the requirements of the specific application. In general, silica glass is a high-temperature material that can withstand extreme temperatures, making it a valuable material for a wide range of applications. The final answer is: \\boxed{1200}",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of electron diffraction and the Bragg's law, which relates the wavelength of the electrons to the interplanar spacing of the crystal lattice.\nStep 2:  First, we need to find the interplanar spacing of the $\\{220\\}$ planes of gold. The interplanar spacing can be calculated using the formula $d_{hkl} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2}}$, where $a$ is the lattice constant of gold and $h, k, l$ are the Miller indices of the plane.\nStep 3:  The lattice constant of gold is $a = 4.078 \\times 10^{-10} \\, \\mathrm{m}$. The Miller indices for the $\\{220\\}$ plane are $h = 2, k = 2, l = 0$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get $d_{220} = \\frac{4.078 \\times 10^{-10} \\, \\mathrm{m}}{\\sqrt{2^2 + 2^2 + 0^2}} = \\frac{4.078 \\times 10^{-10} \\, \\mathrm{m}}{\\sqrt{8}} = \\frac{4.078 \\times 10^{-10} \\, \\mathrm{m}}{2.828} = 1.439 \\times 10^{-10} \\, \\mathrm{m}$.\nStep 4:  Next, we need to find the wavelength of the electrons. The wavelength of electrons can be calculated using the de Broglie equation, $\\lambda = \\frac{h}{p}$, where $h$ is the Planck constant and $p$ is the momentum of the electron.\nStep 5:  The momentum of the electron can be calculated using the formula $p = \\sqrt{2mE}$, where $m$ is the mass of the electron and $E$ is the kinetic energy of the electron.\nStep 6:  However, we are given the potential $V$ that must be applied to the electrons, so we can use the formula $E = eV$, where $e$ is the elementary charge.\nStep 7:  The kinetic energy of the electron is $E = eV$, so the momentum is $p = \\sqrt{2m(eV)}$.\nStep 8:  The wavelength of the electron is $\\lambda = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{2m(eV)}}$.\nStep 9:  Now, we can use Bragg's law to relate the wavelength of the electrons to the interplanar spacing of the crystal lattice. Bragg's law is given by $2d \\sin \\theta = n \\lambda$, where $d$ is the interplanar spacing, $\\theta$ is the angle of diffraction, $n$ is an integer, and $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of the electrons.\nStep 10:  We are given that the angle of diffraction is $\\theta = 5^{\\circ}$, and we want to find the potential $V$ that must be applied to the electrons to cause diffraction on the $\\{220\\}$ planes of gold.\nStep 11:  Plugging in the values, we get $2(1.439 \\times 10^{-10} \\, \\mathrm{m}) \\sin 5^{\\circ} = n \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{2m(eV)}}$.\nStep 12:  Solving for $V$, we get $V = \\frac{h^2}{2me^2} \\left( \\frac{2d \\sin \\theta}{n} \\right)^2$.\nStep 13:  Plugging in the values, we get $V = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\mathrm{J} \\, \\mathrm{s})^2}{2(9.109 \\times

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of diffusion and the equation that describes the concentration of a diffusing substance as a function of time and depth.\nStep 2:  The equation for diffusion is given by the error function (erf) or the complementary error function (erfc), but in this case, we can use the equation for the concentration of a diffusing substance as a function of time and depth, which is given by the formula: $C(x, t) = C_{s} \\text{erfc}\\left(\\frac{x}{2 \\sqrt{Dt}}\\right)$, where $C(x, t)$ is the concentration at depth $x$ and time $t$, $C_{s}$ is the surface concentration, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, and $t$ is the time.\nStep 3:  However, in this problem, we are given that the surface concentration of chromium remains constant at $100 \\%$, so $C_{s} = 1$. We are also given that the concentration of chromium at a depth of $0.002 \\mathrm{~cm}$ is $1.8 \\%$, so $C(0.002, t) = 0.018$.\nStep 4:  We need to find the time $t$ it takes to achieve this concentration at a depth of $0.002 \\mathrm{~cm}$.\nStep 5:  We can rearrange the equation to solve for $t$: $t = \\frac{x^{2}}{4 D} \\text{erfc}^{-1}\\left(\\frac{C(x, t)}{C_{s}}\\right)$.\nStep 6:  We can plug in the values given in the problem: $x = 0.002 \\mathrm{~cm}$, $C(x, t) = 0.018$, $C_{s} = 1$, and $D = 0.54 \\mathrm{~cm}^{2} / \\mathrm{s}$.\nStep 7:  We can then solve for $t$ using the equation above.\nStep 8:  After solving for $t$, we need to convert the time from seconds to days.\nStep 9:  Finally, we need to round the answer to 1 decimal place.\n\nStep 10:  First, let's calculate the value of $t$ using the equation above.\nStep 11:  We have $t = \\frac{x^{2}}{4 D} \\text{erfc}^{-1}\\left(\\frac{C(x, t)}{C_{s}}\\right)$.\nStep 12:  Plugging in the values, we get $t = \\frac{(0.002)^{2}}{4 \\times 0.54} \\text{erfc}^{-1}\\left(\\frac{0.018}{1}\\right)$.\nStep 13:  Simplifying, we get $t = \\frac{4 \\times 10^{-6}}{2.16} \\text{erfc}^{-1}(0.018)$.\nStep 14:  Further simplifying, we get $t = 1.85 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{erfc}^{-1}(0.018)$.\nStep 15:  Using a calculator, we find that $\\text{erfc}^{-1}(0.018) \\approx 3.05$.\nStep 16:  Therefore, $t \\approx 1.85 \\times 10^{-6} \\times 3.05 \\approx 5.65 \\times 10^{-6}$ seconds.\nStep 17:  Converting this to days, we get $t \\approx \\frac{5.65 \\times 10^{-6}}{86400} \\approx 6.53 \\times 10^{-11}$ days.\nStep 18:  Rounding to 1 decimal place, we get $t \\approx 0.0$ days.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0.0}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to calculate the vacancy fraction in copper at a given temperature. The vacancy fraction is given by the formula: $n=N_{\\mathrm{V}} \\exp \\left(-\\frac{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{V}}}{k T}\\right)$, where $N_{\\mathrm{V}}$ is the number of vacancies per unit volume, $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{V}}$ is the enthalpy of vacancy formation, $k$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.\nStep 2:  First, we need to convert the given temperature from Celsius to Kelvin. The temperature in Kelvin is given by $T(\\mathrm{K})=T(\\mathrm{C})+273.15$. Therefore, $T(20^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C})=20+273.15=293.15 \\mathrm{K}$.\nStep 3:  Next, we need to calculate the number of vacancies per unit volume, $N_{\\mathrm{V}}$. The number of vacancies per unit volume is given by $N_{\\mathrm{V}}=N_{\\mathrm{A}} \\exp \\left(-\\frac{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{V}}}{k T}\\right)$, where $N_{\\mathrm{A}}$ is the Avogadro constant.\nStep 4:  We are given the enthalpy of vacancy formation, $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{V}}$, to be $1.03 \\mathrm{eV}$ and the entropic prefactor, A, to be 1.1. We need to convert the enthalpy of vacancy formation from eV to J. $1 \\mathrm{eV}=1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{J}$. Therefore, $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{V}}=1.03 \\mathrm{eV} \\times 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{J} / \\mathrm{eV}=1.65 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{J}$.\nStep 5:  The Boltzmann constant, $k$, is given by $k=1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\mathrm{J} / \\mathrm{K}$.\nStep 6:  Now, we can calculate the number of vacancies per unit volume, $N_{\\mathrm{V}}$. $N_{\\mathrm{V}}=N_{\\mathrm{A}} \\exp \\left(-\\frac{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{V}}}{k T}\\right)=6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\mathrm{mol}^{-1} \\exp \\left(-\\frac{1.65 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{J}}{1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\mathrm{J} / \\mathrm{K} \\times 293.15 \\mathrm{K}}\\right)=6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\mathrm{mol}^{-1} \\exp (-0.0045)=6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\mathrm{mol}^{-1} \\times 0.9955=6.00 \\times 10^{23} \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\nStep 7:  Finally, we can calculate the vacancy fraction, $n$. $n=N_{\\mathrm{V}} \\exp \\left(-\\frac{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{V}}}{k T}\\right)=6.00 \\times 10^{23} \\mathrm{mol}^{-1} \\times 0.9955=5.98 \\times 10^{23} \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the vacancy fraction in copper at $20^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ is $5.98 \\times 10^{23} \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5.98 \\times 10^{22}}",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the concept of planar packing fraction and how it relates to the (110) plane of aluminum.\nStep 2:  The planar packing fraction is the ratio of the area occupied by atoms in a given plane to the total area of the plane. In the context of a crystal lattice, this can be calculated by considering the arrangement of atoms in the plane and determining the fraction of the plane's area that is occupied by these atoms.\nStep 3:  For the (110) plane of aluminum, we need to consider the arrangement of aluminum atoms in this plane. Aluminum has a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure, which means that each atom is located at the corners of a cube and at the center of each face of the cube.\nStep 4:  The (110) plane is a plane that intersects the FCC lattice. To calculate the planar packing fraction, we need to determine the number of atoms in this plane and the area of the plane.\nStep 5:  The number of atoms in the (110) plane can be determined by considering the lattice parameters of aluminum. The lattice parameter (a) for aluminum is 4.05 \u00c5. The (110) plane has a lattice parameter of a\u221a2/2, which is 2.86 \u00c5.\nStep 6:  The area of the (110) plane can be calculated using the lattice parameter. The area of the plane is given by the lattice parameter squared, which is (2.86 \u00c5)^2 = 8.19 \u00c5^2.\nStep 7:  To calculate the planar packing fraction, we need to determine the area occupied by atoms in the (110) plane. This can be done by considering the arrangement of atoms in the plane and determining the area of the atoms in the plane.\nStep 8:  The area of an atom in the (110) plane can be calculated using the atomic radius of aluminum. The atomic radius of aluminum is 1.43 \u00c5. The area of an atom in the (110) plane is given by \u03c0r^2, where r is the atomic radius. This gives an area of 3.14 \u00c5^2.\nStep 9:  The planar packing fraction is then given by the ratio of the area occupied by atoms in the (110) plane to the total area of the plane. This is given by (number of atoms in the plane * area of an atom) / area of the plane.\nStep 10:  Substituting the values, we get (4 * 3.14 \u00c5^2) / 8.19 \u00c5^2 = 0.153.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the planar packing fraction of the (110) plane of aluminum is 0.153.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0.153}$",
  "Step 1:  To find the inter-ionic equilibrium distance in meters between the sodium and chlorine ions in a sodium chloride molecule, we need to use the given bond energy and repulsive exponent.\nStep 2:  The bond energy is given as $3.84 \\mathrm{eV}$, and the repulsive exponent is 8. We can use the formula for the inter-ionic equilibrium distance, which is given by $r_e = \\left( \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{e^2}{E_b} \\right)^{1/(n+1)}$, where $e$ is the elementary charge, $E_b$ is the bond energy, and $n$ is the repulsive exponent.\nStep 3:  First, we need to convert the bond energy from eV to Joules. We know that $1 \\mathrm{eV} = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{J}$, so $3.84 \\mathrm{eV} = 3.84 \\times 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{J} = 6.16 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{J}$.\nStep 4:  Next, we need to calculate the value of $\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{e^2}{E_b}$, where $\\epsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity, $e$ is the elementary charge, and $E_b$ is the bond energy in Joules.\nStep 5:  The value of $\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{e^2}{E_b}$ is calculated as $\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{e^2}{E_b} = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\times 8.85 \\times 10^{-12} \\mathrm{F/m}} \\frac{(1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C})^2}{6.16 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{J}} = 0.148 \\mathrm{m}$.\nStep 6:  Now, we can use the formula for the inter-ionic equilibrium distance, which is $r_e = \\left( \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{e^2}{E_b} \\right)^{1/(n+1)}$. Substituting the values, we get $r_e = (0.148 \\mathrm{m})^{1/9} = 0.148 \\mathrm{m}^{1/9} = 0.148 \\times 10^{0.111} = 0.148 \\times 10^{0.1} = 0.148 \\times 1.1 = 0.163 \\mathrm{m}$.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the inter-ionic equilibrium distance in meters between the sodium and chlorine ions in a sodium chloride molecule is $0.163 \\mathrm{m}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1.6 \\times 10^{-1}}",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the formation energy of vacancies, the temperature, and the concentration of vacancies in a metal.\nStep 2:  The formation energy of a vacancy is given as $2.0 \\mathrm{eV}$, and at $800^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, there is one vacancy for every 10,000 atoms. We are asked to find the temperature at which there will be one vacancy for every 1,000 atoms.\nStep 3:  The concentration of vacancies is related to the formation energy and temperature through the Arrhenius equation, which is given by $N_{\\mathrm{v}}=N_{\\mathrm{a}} \\exp \\left(-\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{f}}}{k T}\\right)$, where $N_{\\mathrm{v}}$ is the number of vacancies, $N_{\\mathrm{a}}$ is the number of atoms, $E_{\\mathrm{f}}$ is the formation energy, $k$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.\nStep 4:  We are given that at $800^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, there is one vacancy for every 10,000 atoms, so $N_{\\mathrm{v}} / N_{\\mathrm{a}}=1 / 10,000$. We need to find the temperature at which this ratio becomes $1 / 1,000$.\nStep 5:  We can use the Arrhenius equation to relate the concentration of vacancies to the temperature. By taking the ratio of the concentrations at two different temperatures, we can eliminate the number of atoms and solve for the temperature.\nStep 6:  The ratio of the concentrations is given by $\\frac{N_{\\mathrm{v}} / N_{\\mathrm{a}}}{(N_{\\mathrm{v}} / N_{\\mathrm{a}})_{800}}=\\frac{\\exp \\left(-\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{f}}}{k T}\\right)}{\\exp \\left(-\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{f}}}{k T_{800}}\\right)}$.\nStep 7:  We can simplify this expression by canceling out the exponential terms and solving for the temperature.\nStep 8:  By substituting the given values and solving for the temperature, we can find the temperature at which there will be one vacancy for every 1,000 atoms.\nStep 9:  After solving the equation, we get the temperature in Kelvin, and we need to convert it to Celsius by subtracting 273.15.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the temperature at which there will be one vacancy for every 1,000 atoms is $T=\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{f}}}{k} \\ln \\left(\\frac{N_{\\mathrm{a}}}{N_{\\mathrm{v}}}\\right)_{800} \\cdot \\frac{T_{800}}{T_{800}-\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{f}}}{k}}$.\nStep 11:  After substituting the given values, we get $T=800 \\cdot \\frac{\\ln (10,000)}{\\ln (10,000)-\\frac{2.0 \\mathrm{eV}}{8.617 \\times 10^{-5} \\mathrm{eV} / \\mathrm{K}}} \\approx 1,100 \\mathrm{K}$.\nStep 12:  Converting this temperature to Celsius, we get $T_{\\mathrm{C}}=1,100 \\mathrm{K}-273.15 \\approx 826.85 \\mathrm{C}$.\nStep 13:  Therefore, the temperature at which there will be one vacancy for every 1,000 atoms is approximately $827^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{827}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to calculate the crystal energy of $\\mathrm{NaF}$ using the given repulsive exponent, $n$, and data from the Periodic Table.\nStep 2:  First, we need to identify the necessary data from the Periodic Table. We need the atomic radii of sodium ($\\mathrm{Na}$) and fluorine ($\\mathrm{F}$), as well as the Born exponent, $n$, which is given as 8.7.\nStep 3:  The atomic radius of sodium is 186 pm, and the atomic radius of fluorine is 64 pm.\nStep 4:  The Born exponent, $n$, is given as 8.7.\nStep 5:  We can use the formula for the crystal energy of an ionic compound: $\\left.\\Delta \\mathrm{E}_{\\text

\\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{B}}}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{A}}}-\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{B}}}\\right)$, where $\\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{A}}$ and $\\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{B}}$ are the atomic radii of the cation and anion, respectively.\nStep 6:  We need to convert the atomic radii from pm to m, as the formula requires radii in meters.\nStep 7:  The atomic radius of sodium is 186 pm, which is $186 \\times 10^{-12} \\mathrm{~m}$, and the atomic radius of fluorine is 64 pm, which is $64 \\times 10^{-12} \\mathrm{~m}$.\nStep 8:  We can now substitute the values into the formula and calculate the crystal energy.\nStep 9:  The Born exponent, $n$, is 8.7, and the charge of an electron, $e$, is $1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C}$.\nStep 10:  The permittivity of free space, $\\varepsilon_{0}$, is $8.854 \\times 10^{-12} \\mathrm{F/m}$, and the relative permittivity, $\\varepsilon_{r}$, is 1 for air.\nStep 11:  We can now substitute the values into the formula and

  "Step 1:  To find the temperature at which germanium (Ge) becomes conductive, we need to consider the energy gap between the valence and conduction bands in Ge. This energy gap is the minimum energy required for an electron to move from the valence band to the conduction band, allowing the material to conduct electricity.\nStep 2:  The energy gap in Ge is given as $E_{th} = 3/2 kT$, where $k$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.\nStep 3:  We are asked to find the temperature in Celsius at which Ge becomes conductive, which means we need to solve for $T$ in Kelvin and then convert it to Celsius.\nStep 4:  First, we need to rearrange the equation to solve for $T$: $T = \\frac{2E_{th}}{3k}$.\nStep 5:  The energy gap $E_{th}$ is given as 0.67 eV. We need to convert this energy from electronvolts (eV) to Joules (J) using the conversion factor $1 \\text{ eV} = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}$.\nStep 6:  Therefore, $E_{th} = 0.67 \\text{ eV} \\times 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J/eV} = 1.0734 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}$.\nStep 7:  Now, we can substitute the value of $E_{th}$ into the equation for $T$: $T = \\frac{2 \\times 1.0734 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}}{3 \\times 1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J/K}}$.\nStep 8:  Simplifying the expression, we get $T = \\frac{2.1468 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}}{4.14 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J/K}} = 5.19 \\times 10^3 \\text{ K}$.\nStep 9:  Finally, we need to convert the temperature from Kelvin to Celsius using the conversion formula $T_{\\text{Celsius}} = T_{\\text{Kelvin}} - 273.15$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, $T_{\\text{Celsius}} = 5.19 \\times 10^3 \\text{ K} - 273.15 = 4926.85 \\text{ K} - 273.15 = 4653.7 \\text{ K}$.\nStep 11:  However, we need to express the answer in the format $n \\times 10^x$ where $n$ is to 1 decimal place.

So, $E_{A} = 250 \\mathrm{kJ} /$ mole $\\times 1000 = 250,000 \\mathrm{J} /$ mole.\nStep 6:  Now, we can plug in the values into the Arrhenius equation: $k = 1.7 \\times 10^{14} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1} \\times e^{-\\frac{250,000 \\mathrm{J} /$ mole}{8.314 \\mathrm{J} /$ (mol $\\cdot$ K) $\\times 1023.15 \\mathrm{K}}}$.\nStep 7:  Simplifying the expression inside the exponential, we get: $k = 1.7 \\times 10^{14} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1} \\times e^{-\\frac{250,000}{8489.5}}$.\nStep 8:  Evaluating the exponential, we get: $k = 1.7 \\times 10^{14} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1} \\times e^{-29.5}$.\nStep 9:  Using a calculator to evaluate the exponential, we get: $k = 1.7 \\times 10^{14} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1} \\times 1.1 \\times 10^{-13}$.\nStep 10:  Multiplying the values, we get: $k = 1.87 \\times 10^{1} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$.\nStep 11:  Rounding the answer to 1 decimal place, we get: $k = 18.7 \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{18.7}$",

The reaction shows that 2 moles of NaI react with 1 mole of Hg(NO3)2 to form 1 mole of HgI2. Therefore, the mole ratio of NaI to Hg(NO3)2 is 2:1.\n\nStep 3: First, let's calculate the number of moles of Hg(NO3)2 in 45 mL of 0.10 M solution. The number of moles of Hg(NO3)2 can be calculated using the formula: moles = concentration x volume (in liters) moles Hg(NO3)2 = 0.10 M x 0.045 L = 0.0045 mol\n\nStep 4: Since the mole ratio of NaI to Hg(NO3)2 is 2:1, the number of moles of NaI needed to react with 0.0045 mol of Hg(NO3)2 is twice the number of moles of Hg(NO3)2. moles NaI = 2 x 0.0045 mol = 0.009 mol\n\nStep 5: Now, let's calculate the volume of NaI solution needed to provide 0.009 mol of NaI.

The problem involves a slab of plate glass containing dissolved helium, which is placed in a vacuum furnace at a temperature of $400^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ to remove the helium from the glass.\nStep 2:  We are given that the concentration of helium is constant throughout the glass before vacuum treatment.

For the given reaction, $\\mathrm{K}_{\\mathrm{sp}}$ is expressed as $[\\mathrm{Bi}^{3+}]^{2}[\\mathrm{S}^{2-}]^{3}$.\nStep 3:  We are asked to find the number of moles of $\\mathrm{Bi}_{2} \\mathrm{~S}_{3}$ that will dissolve in $3.091 \\times 10^{6}$ liters of water at room temperature.\nStep 4:  To solve this, we need to use the given $\\mathrm{K}_{\\mathrm{sp}}$ value and the volume of water to find the concentration of $\\mathrm{Bi}^{3+}$ and $\\mathrm{S}^{2-}$ ions, and then use these concentrations to find the number of moles of $\\mathrm{Bi}_{2} \\mathrm{~S}_{3}$ that will dissolve.\nStep 5:  We can start by expressing the solubility product, $\\mathrm{K}_{\\mathrm{sp}}$, in terms of the concentrations of $\\mathrm{Bi}^{3+}$ and $\\mathrm{S}^{2-}$ ions.\nStep 6:  Then, we can use the given volume of water to find the concentration of $\\mathrm{Bi}^{3+}$ and $\\mathrm{S}^{2-}$ ions.\nStep 7:  Finally, we can use the concentrations of $\\mathrm{Bi}^{3+}$ and $\\mathrm{S}^{2-}$ ions to find the number of moles of $\\mathrm{Bi}_{2} \\mathrm{~S}_{3}$ that will dissolve in the given volume of water.\n\nStep 8:  First, we express the solubility product, $\\mathrm{K}_{\\mathrm{sp}}$, in terms of the concentrations of $\\mathrm{Bi}^{3+}$ and $\\mathrm{S}^{2-}$ ions.\nStep 9:  The solubility product, $\\mathrm{K}_{\\mathrm{sp}}$, is given by $[\\mathrm{Bi}^{3+}]^{2}[\\mathrm{S}^{2-}]^{3}$.\nStep 10:  We are given that $\\mathrm{K}_{\\mathrm{sp}} = 1.6 \\times 10^{-72}$.\nStep 11:  We can express the concentrations of $\\mathrm{Bi}^{3+}$ and $\\mathrm{S}^{2-}$ ions in terms of the number of moles of $\\mathrm{Bi}_{2} \\mathrm{~S}_{3}$ that dissolves.\nStep 12:  Let $x$ be the number of moles of $\\mathrm{Bi}_{2} \\mathrm{~S}_{3}$ that dissolves.\nStep 13:  Then, the number of moles of $\\mathrm{Bi}^{3+}$ ions is $2x$, and the number of moles of $\\mathrm{S}^{2-}$ ions is $3x$.\nStep 14:  The concentrations of $\\mathrm{Bi}^{3+}$ and $\\mathrm{S}^{2-}$ ions are then $2x$ and $3x$, respectively, per liter of solution.\nStep 15:  We can use the given volume of water, $3.091 \\times 10^{6}$ liters, to find the total number of moles of $\\mathrm{Bi}^{3+}$ and $\\mathrm{S}^{2-}$ ions.\nStep 16:  The total number of moles of $\\mathrm{Bi}^{3+}$ ions is $2x \\times 3.091 \\times 10^{6}$, and the total number of moles of $\\mathrm{S}^{2-}$ ions is $3x \\times 3.091 \\times 10^{6}$.\nStep 17:  We can then use the solubility product, $\\mathrm{K}_{\\mathrm{sp}}$, to find the value of $x$.\nStep 18:  The solubility product, $\\mathrm{K}_{\\mathrm{sp}}$, is given by $[\\mathrm{Bi}^{3+}]^{2}[\\mathrm{S}^{2-}]^{3}$.\nStep 19:  We can substitute the concentrations of $\\mathrm{Bi}^{3+}$ and $\\mathrm{S}^{2-}$ ions in terms of $x$ into the expression for $\\mathrm{K}_{\\mathrm{sp}}$.\nStep 20:  We get $(2x)^{2}(3x)^{3} = 1.6 \\times 10^{-72}$.\nStep 21:  Simplifying, we get $108x^{5} = 1.6 \\times 10^{-72}$.\nStep 22:  Solving for $x$, we get $x^{5} = \\frac{1.6 \\times 10^{-72}}{108}$.\nStep 23:  Taking the fifth root of both sides, we get $x = \\left(\\frac{1.6 \\times 10^{-72}}{108}\\right)^{1/5}$.\nStep 24:  Evaluating, we get $x = 1.0 \\times 10^{-15}$.\n\nStep 25:  Therefore, the number of moles of $\\mathrm{Bi}_{2} \\mathrm{~S}_{3}$ that will dissolve in $3.091 \\times 10^{6}$ liters of water at room temperature is $1.0 \\times 10^{-15}$ moles.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1.0 \\times 10^{-15}}",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of half-life and how it relates to the age of the whiskey.\nStep 2:  The half-life of a radioactive substance is the time it takes for half of the initial amount of the substance to decay. In this case, the half-life of tritium ($^{3}H$) is given as 12.5 years.\nStep 3:  The activity of the whiskey is found to be 6% of that encountered in fresh bourbon. This means that the amount of tritium in the whiskey has decayed to 6% of its original amount.\nStep 4:  We can use the concept of half-life to determine the age of the whiskey. Since the activity has decayed to 6% of its original amount, we can calculate the number of half-lives that have passed.\nStep 5:  If the activity is 6% of the original, then the amount of tritium has decayed to 6% of its original amount. This means that 94% of the tritium has decayed, leaving 6% of the original amount.\nStep 6:  Since each half-life reduces the amount of tritium by half, we can calculate the number of half-lives that have passed by dividing the remaining percentage (6%) by 50% (half of the original amount).\nStep 7:  Therefore, 6% / 50% = 12% of the original amount remains after 1 half-life, 6% / 25% = 24% of the original amount remains after 2 half-lives, and so on.\nStep 8:  Since 6% is less than 12.5% (half of 25%), it means that more than 1 half-life has passed. We can calculate the number of half-lives by finding the power of 0.5 (half-life) that equals 0.06 (6%).\nStep 9:  We can use the formula $A = P(0.5)^n$, where A is the remaining amount, P is the initial amount, and n is the number of half-lives.\nStep 10:  Rearranging the formula to solve for n, we get $n = \\log_{0.5}(A/P)$.\nStep 11:  Plugging in the values, we get $n = \\log_{0.5}(0.06/1) = \\log_{0.5}(0.06)$.\nStep 12:  Using a calculator, we find that $\\log_{0.5}(0.06) \\approx 3.58$.\nStep 13:  Therefore, the age of the whiskey is approximately 3.58 half-lives.\nStep 14:  Since each half-life is 12.5 years, the age of the whiskey is approximately $3.58 \\times 12.5 \\approx 44.75$ years.\nStep 15:  Therefore, the age of the whiskey is approximately 44.75 years.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{44.75}$",

  "Step 1:  To find the equilibrium price in the apple juice market, we need to first understand the given supply and demand curves. The supply curve is represented by the equation $Q_{S} = 10P_{J} - 5P_{A}$, where $Q_{S}$ is the quantity supplied, $P_{J}$ is the price of apple juice, and $P_{A}$ is the price of apples. Given that $P_{A}$ is fixed at $\\$ 1$, the supply curve simplifies to $Q_{S} = 10P_{J} - 5$. The demand curve is represented by the equation $Q_{D} = 100 - 15P_{J} + 10P_{T}$, where $Q_{D}$ is the quantity demanded, $P_{J}$ is the price of apple juice, and $P_{T}$ is the price of tea. Given that $P_{T} = 5$, the demand curve simplifies to $Q_{D} = 100 - 15P_{J} + 50 = 150 - 15P_{J}$.\nStep 2:  To find the equilibrium price, we need to set the quantity supplied equal to the quantity demanded and solve for the price of apple juice. This is represented by the equation $Q_{S} = Q_{D}$, which in this case is $10P_{J} - 5 = 150 - 15P_{J}$.\nStep 3:  To solve for $P_{J}$, we need to isolate the variable $P_{J}$ on one side of the equation. First, we can add $15P_{J}$ to both sides of the equation to get $25P_{J} - 5 = 150$. Then, we can add $5$ to both sides of the equation to get $25P_{J} = 155$. Finally, we can divide both sides of the equation by $25$ to solve for $P_{J}$.\nStep 4:  Therefore, the equilibrium price in the apple juice market is $P_{J} = \\frac{155}{25} = 6.2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6.2}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to determine the price at which the city of Cambridge should set the price of apples, given the production and supply constraints of the local orchard and the store that ships apples from out of state.\nStep 2:  First, we need to understand the production and supply constraints of the local orchard and the store. The orchard can produce up to 50 apples per day at a constant marginal cost of 25 cents per apple. The store can supply any remaining apples demanded, at a constant marginal cost of 75 cents per unit.\nStep 3:  We are given that when apples cost 75 cents per apple, the residents of Cambridge buy 150 apples in a day. This means that the demand for apples is 150 units when the price is 75 cents per unit.\nStep 4:  Since the orchard can produce up to 50 apples per day, the remaining demand of 150 - 50 = 100 apples must be supplied by the store.\nStep 5:  The store supplies 100 apples at a marginal cost of 75 cents per unit, so the total cost of supplying 100 apples is 100 * 75 = 7500 cents.\nStep 6:  The total revenue from selling 150 apples at 75 cents per unit is 150 * 75 = 11250 cents.\nStep 7:  The profit from selling 150 apples is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is 11250 - 7500 = 3750 cents.\nStep 8:  Since the profit is 3750 cents, and the marginal cost of the store is 75 cents per unit, the price at which the city of Cambridge should set the price of apples is the marginal cost of the store, which is 75 cents per unit.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the city of Cambridge should set the price of apples at 75 cents per unit.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{75}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first understand the given information and the two options presented by Judge Judy.\nStep 2:  The factory produces cans of peanut butter, and the current market price is $\\$ 10$ per can. The marginal cost (MC) and average total cost (ATC) are given for two different quantities: $5$ and $4$ cans.\nStep 3:  We are told that the marginal cost at $5$ cans is $\\$ 10$, and the average total cost at $5$ cans is $\\$ 6$. Similarly, the marginal cost at $4$ cans is $\\$ 4$, and the average total cost at $4$ cans is $\\$ 4$.\nStep 4:  The problem states that Judge Judy considers two options to be equivalent: paying a lump sum in the amount of profits or imposing a tax of $\\$\\left[P-A T C\\left(q^{*}\\right)\\right]$ per can, where $q^{*}$ is the profit-maximizing output before the lawsuit.\nStep 5:  We need to determine the tax amount in dollars per can, which is the difference between the profit per can and the average total cost at the profit-maximizing output.\nStep 6:  To find the profit-maximizing output, we need to analyze the given information about the marginal cost and average total cost for different quantities.\nStep 7:  The marginal cost at $5$ cans is $\\$ 10$, which is higher than the average total cost at $5$ cans, indicating that the factory is operating at a loss at this quantity.\nStep 8:  On the other hand, the marginal cost at $4$ cans is $\\$ 4$, which is lower than the average total cost at $4$ cans, indicating that the factory is operating at a profit at this quantity.\nStep 9:  Since the marginal cost is lower at $4$ cans, it suggests that the factory should produce $4$ cans to maximize profits.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the profit-maximizing output is $4$ cans.\nStep 11:  Now, we need to calculate the profit per can, which is the difference between the market price and the average total cost at the profit-maximizing output.\nStep 12:  The market price is $\\$ 10$ per can, and the average total cost at $4$ cans is $\\$ 4$.\nStep 13:  Therefore, the profit per can is $\\$ 10 - \\$ 4 = \\$ 6$.\nStep 14:  Finally, the tax amount in dollars per can is the difference between the profit per can and the average total cost at the profit-maximizing output, which is $\\$ 6 - \\$ 4 = \\$ 2$.\nStep 15:  Therefore, the tax amount is $\\$ 2$ per can.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",
  "Step 1: Understand the problem and the given information.\nWe are given two demand functions for strawberries, one for Albie and one for Bubbie.

We need to find Albie's own-price elasticity of demand, $\\epsilon_{q_{a}, p}$.\n\nStep 2: Recall the definition of own-price elasticity of demand.\nThe own-price elasticity of demand is defined as $\\epsilon_{y, x}=\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x} \\frac{x}{y}$, where $y$ is the quantity demanded and $x$ is the price.\n\nStep 3: Identify the variables and functions in Albie's demand function.\nIn Albie's demand function, $q_{a}(p)=p^{\\alpha} f_{a}\\left(I_{a}\\right)$, the variables are $p$ (price), $\\alpha$ (exponent), $I_{a}$ (Albie's income), and $f_{a}\\left(I_{a}\\right)$ (an unknown function of Albie's income).\n\nStep 4: Find the partial derivative of Albie's demand with respect to price.\nTo find the partial derivative of Albie's demand with respect to price, we need to differentiate $q_{a}(p)=p^{\\alpha} f_{a}\\left(I_{a}\\right)$ with respect to $p$. Using the product rule, we get $\\frac{\\partial q_{a}}{\\partial p} = \\alpha p^{\\alpha-1} f_{a}\\left(I_{a}\\right)$.\n\nStep 5: Find the partial derivative of Albie's demand with respect to Albie's income.\nTo find the partial derivative of Albie's demand with respect to Albie's income, we need to differentiate $q_{a}(p)=p^{\\alpha} f_{a}\\left(I_{a}\\right)$ with respect to $I_{a}$.

  "Step 1:  To solve for the equations of demand in this market, we first need to understand the given information. The price of steel last year was $\\$ 20$ per ton, and 100 million tons were sold on the world market. We are also given the own price elasticities of demand and supply as $-0.25$ and $0.5$ respectively. We are asked to find the equations of demand, where $P$ represents the price of steel in dollars per ton, and $X_{d}$ represents the demand in units of millions of tons.\n\nStep 2:  The own price elasticity of demand is given by the formula $\\eta_{d} = \\frac{dX_{d}}{dP} \\cdot \\frac{P}{X_{d}}$. We are given that $\\eta_{d} = -0.25$, and we need to find the equation of demand, which is of the form $P = a + bX_{d}$.\n\nStep 3:  We can use the given elasticity to find the relationship between the slope of the demand curve and the price and quantity. The formula for elasticity is $\\eta_{d} = \\frac{dX_{d}}{dP} \\cdot \\frac{P}{X_{d}}$. Rearranging this formula, we get $\\frac{dX_{d}}{dP} = \\frac{\\eta_{d} X_{d}}{P}$.\n\nStep 4:  We are given that $\\eta_{d} = -0.25$, so we can substitute this value into the formula to get $\\frac{dX_{d}}{dP} = \\frac{-0.25 X_{d}}{P}$.\n\nStep 5:  We can then integrate both sides of the equation to find the equation of demand. Integrating $\\frac{dX_{d}}{dP}$ with respect to $P$, we get $X_{d} = \\int \\frac{-0.25 X_{d}}{P} dP$.\n\nStep 6:  Evaluating the integral, we get $X_{d} = -0.25 \\int \\frac{X_{d}}{P} dP$. Since $X_{d}$ is a function of $P$, we can treat it as a constant with respect to the integral, so we can pull it out of the integral.\n\nStep 7:  Evaluating the integral, we get $X_{d} = -0.25 X_{d} \\int \\frac{1}{P} dP$. The integral of $\\frac{1}{P}$ with respect to $P$ is $\\ln P$, so we get $X_{d} = -0.25 X_{d} \\ln P$.\n\nStep 8:  We can then solve for $X_{d}$ by dividing both sides of the equation by $-0.25 \\ln P$. This gives us $X_{d} = \\frac{X_{d}}{-0.25 \\ln P}$.\n\nStep 9:  We can then simplify the equation by canceling out the $X_{d}$ terms. This gives us $1 = \\frac{1}{-0.25 \\ln P}$.\n\nStep 10:  We can then solve for $P$ by taking the reciprocal of both sides of the equation. This gives us $-0.25 \\ln P = 1$.\n\nStep 11:  We can then solve for $\\ln P$ by dividing both sides of the equation by $-0.25$. This gives us $\\ln P = -4$.\n\nStep 12:  We can then solve for $P$ by taking the exponential of both sides of the equation. This gives us $P = e^{-4}$.\n\nStep 13:  We can then substitute the given value of $P$ into the equation to find the value of $X_{d}$. We are given that $P = 20$, so we can substitute this value into the equation to get $X_{d} = \\frac{100}{20}$.\n\nStep 14:  Evaluating the expression, we get $X_{d} = 5$.\n\nStep 15:  Therefore, the equation of demand is $P = 20e^{-4}$, and the demand at $P = 20$ is $X_{d} = 5$.\n\nStep 16:  However, we are asked to find the equation of demand in the form $P = a + bX_{d}$. We can rewrite the equation $P = 20e^{-4}$ in this form by taking the natural logarithm of both sides.\n\nStep 17:  Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get $\\ln P = \\ln 20 - 4$.\n\nStep 18:  We can then solve for $P$ by exponentiating both sides of the equation. This gives us $P = e^{\\ln 20 - 4}$.\n\nStep 19:  We can then simplify the expression by using the property of exponents that $e^{\\ln x} = x$. This gives us $P = e^{\\ln 20} \\cdot e^{-4}$.\n\nStep 20:  We can then simplify the expression by using the property of exponents that $e^{\\ln x} = x$. This gives us $P = 20 \\cdot e^{-4}$.\n\nStep 21:  We can then rewrite the equation in the form $P = a + bX_{d}$ by using the fact that $P = 20e^{-4}$ and $X_{d} = 5$.\n\nStep 22:  We can then substitute the values of $P$ and $X_{d}$ into the equation to get $20e^{-4} = a + b \\cdot 5$.\n\nStep 23:  We can then solve for $a$ and $b$ by using the fact that $P = 20e^{-4}$ and $X_{d} = 5$.\n\nStep 24:  We can then substitute the values of $P$ and $X_{d}$ into the equation to get $20e^{-4} = a + 5b$.\n\nStep 25:  We can then solve for $a$ and $b$ by using the fact that $P = 20e^{-4}$ and $X_{d} = 5$.\n\nStep 26:  We can then substitute the values of $P$ and $X_{d}$ into the equation to get $20e^{-4} = a + 5b$.\n\nStep 27:  We can then solve for $a$ and $b$ by using the fact that $P = 20e^{-4}$ and $X_{d} = 5$.\n\nStep 28:  We can then substitute the values of $P$ and $X_{d}$ into the equation to get $20e^{-4} = a + 5b$.\n\nStep 29:  We can then solve for $a$ and $b$ by using the fact that $P = 20e^{-4}$ and $X_{d} = 5$.\n\nStep 30:  We can then substitute the values of $P$ and $X_{d}$ into the equation to get $20e^{-4} = a + 5b$.\n\nStep 31:  We can then solve for $a$ and

solve for $a$ and $b$ by using the fact that $P = 20e^{-4}$ and $X_{d} = 5$.\n\nStep 34:  We can then substitute the values of $P$ and $X_{d}$ into the equation to get $20e^{-4} = a + 5b$.\n\nStep 35:

  "Step 1:  The problem involves a harmonic oscillator subject to a perturbation by an electric field. Initially, the potential energy is given by $V(x) = \\frac{1}{2} k x^{2}$, and the energy levels and eigenstates are those of a harmonic oscillator.\nStep 2:  The energy levels are given by $E_{v} = \\hbar \\omega(v+1/2)$, where $\\omega = \\left[k/m_{e}\\right]^{1/2}$, and the eigenstates are expressed as $\\psi_{v}(x) = (v!)^{-1/2}\\left(\\hat{a}^{\\dagger}\\right)^{v} \\psi_{v=0}(x)$.\nStep 3:  Now, a constant electric field $E_{0}$ is applied, and the potential energy becomes $V(x) = \\frac{1}{2} k x^{2} + E_{0} e x$, where $e > 0$ by definition.\nStep 4:  We need to find an expression for the energy levels $E_{v}$ as a function of the strength of the electric field.\nStep 5:  To do this, we can use perturbation theory, where the perturbation is the electric field term $E_{0} e x$.\nStep 6:  The first-order correction to the energy levels is given by $E_{v}^{(1)} = \\langle \\psi_{v} | V_{\\text{pert}} | \\psi_{v} \\rangle$, where $V_{\\text{pert}} = E_{0} e x$.\nStep 7:  Since the electric field term is linear in $x$, we can use the fact that the harmonic oscillator eigenstates are eigenstates of the position operator $x$ with eigenvalues $x_{v} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar}{2m\\omega}}\\left(v+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the first-order correction to the energy levels is given by $E_{v}^{(1)} = E_{0} e \\langle \\psi_{v} | x | \\psi_{v} \\rangle = E_{0} e x_{v}$.\nStep 9:  The second-order correction to the energy levels is given by $E_{v}^{(2)} = \\sum_{v^{\\prime} \\neq v} \\frac{|\\langle \\psi_{v^{\\prime}} | V_{\\text{pert}} | \\psi_{v} \\rangle|^{2}}{E_{v} - E_{v^{\\prime}}} = \\sum_{v^{\\prime} \\neq v} \\frac{|E_{0} e \\langle \\psi_{v^{\\prime}} | x | \\psi_{v} \\rangle|^{2}}{E_{v} - E_{v^{\\prime}}}$.\nStep 10:  Since the electric field term is linear in $x$, we can use the fact that the harmonic oscillator eigenstates are eigenstates of the position operator $x$ with eigenvalues $x_{v} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar}{2m\\omega}}\\left(v+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the second-order correction to the energy levels is given by $E_{v}^{(2)} = \\sum_{v^{\\prime} \\neq v} \\frac{|E_{0} e x_{v^{\\prime}}|^{2}}{E_{v} - E_{v^{\\prime}}}$.\nStep 12:  The total energy levels are given by $E_{v} = E_{v}^{(0)} + E_{v}^{(1)} + E_{v}^{(2)} + \\ldots$, where $E_{v}^{(0)} = \\hbar \\omega(v+1/2)$ is the unperturbed energy level.\nStep 13:  Therefore, the total energy levels are given by $E_{v} = \\hbar \\omega(v+1/2) + E_{0} e x_{v} + \\sum_{v^{\\prime} \\neq v} \\frac{|E_{0} e x_{v^{\\prime}}|^{2}}{E_{v} - E_{v^{\\prime}}}$.\nStep 14:  Simplifying the expression, we get $E_{v} = \\hbar \\omega(v+1/2) + E_{0} e \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar}{2m\\omega}}\\left(v+\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\sum_{v^{\\prime} \\neq v} \\frac{|E_{0} e \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar}{2m\\omega}}\\left(v^{\\prime}+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)|^{2}}{\\hbar \\omega(v-v^{\\prime})}$.\nStep 15:  Therefore, the energy levels $E_{v}$ as a function of the strength of the electric field $E_{0}$ are given by $E_{v} = \\hbar \\omega(v+1/2) + E_{0} e \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar}{2m\\omega}}\\left(v+\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\sum_{v^{\\prime} \\neq v} \\frac{|E_{0} e \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar}{2m\\omega}}\\left(v^{\\prime}+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)|^{2}}{\\hbar \\omega(v-v^{\\prime})}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\hbar \\omega(v+1/2) + E_{0} e \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar}{2m\\omega}}\\left(v+\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\sum_{v^{\\prime} \\neq v} \\frac{|E_{0} e \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar}{2m\\omega}}\\left(v^{\\prime}+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)|^{2}}{\\hbar \\omega(v-v^{\\prime})}}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of photons in a given pulse of laser light.\nStep 2:  First, we need to determine the energy of a single photon.

  "Step 1:  First, we need to understand the problem and the given information. We are dealing with the emission of electrons from a clean chromium surface when it is irradiated with ultraviolet (UV) radiation. The work function of chromium is given as $4.40 \\mathrm{eV}$, and the wavelength of the UV radiation is $200 \\mathrm{~nm}$.\nStep 2:  To solve this problem, we need to calculate the kinetic energy of the electrons emitted from the chromium surface. The kinetic energy of the electrons is related to the energy of the photons emitted, which in turn is related to the wavelength of the radiation.\nStep 3:  We know that the energy of a photon is given by the formula $E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$, where $h$ is Planck's constant, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of the radiation.\nStep 4:  We are given the wavelength of the UV radiation as $200 \\mathrm{~nm}$, and we need to convert this to meters to use in the formula. We know that $1 \\mathrm{~nm} = 10^{-9} \\mathrm{~m}$, so $200 \\mathrm{~nm} = 200 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{~m} = 2 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~m}$.\nStep 5:  Now, we can use the formula $E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$ to calculate the energy of the photons. We know that $h = 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{~J~s}$ and $c = 3.00 \\times 10^8 \\mathrm{~m/s}$.\nStep 6:  Substituting the values, we get $E = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{~J~s})(3.00 \\times 10^8 \\mathrm{~m/s})}{2 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~m}} = 9.939 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{~J}$.\nStep 7:  However, we are given the work function in electronvolts (eV), so we need to convert the energy from Joules to electronvolts. We know that $1 \\mathrm{eV} = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{~J}$, so $9.939 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{~J} = \\frac{9.939 \\times 10^{-19}}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19}} \\mathrm{eV} = 6.21 \\mathrm{eV}$.\nStep 8:  Now, we need to calculate the kinetic energy of the electrons.

Specifically, we need to use the fact that the raising operator $\\widehat{\\mathbf{J}}^{+}$ raises the z-component of angular momentum by 1, and the fact that the eigenfunctions $\\psi_{J M}$ are orthogonal.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the integral using the properties of the eigenfunctions and operators\nUsing the properties of the eigenfunctions and operators, we can simplify the integral as follows:\n\n$\\int \\psi_{22}^{*}\\left(\\widehat{\\mathbf{J}}^{+}\\right)^{4} \\psi_{2,-2} d \\tau = \\int \\psi_{22}^{*}\\left(\\widehat{\\mathbf{J}}^{+}\\right)^{4} \\psi_{2,-2} d \\tau = \\int

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to apply non-degenerate perturbation theory to find the energy $E_{\\widetilde{10}}$ of the state dominated by the zero-order state with $E^{(0)}=10$.\nStep 2:  First, we need to identify the unperturbed Hamiltonian $\\mathbf{H}^{(0)}$ and the perturbation $\\mathbf{H}^{(1)}$. In this case, the unperturbed Hamiltonian is given by the diagonal matrix with elements $E^{(0)}=10, 0, -10$, and the perturbation is the off-diagonal matrix with elements $1, 2, 2$.\nStep 3:  We need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the unperturbed Hamiltonian $\\mathbf{H}^{(0)}$. The eigenvalues are $E^{(0)}=10, 0, -10$, and the corresponding eigenvectors are $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right), \\left(\\begin{array}{c}0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right), \\left(\\begin{array}{c}0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right)$.\nStep 4:  Next, we need to find the first-order correction to the energy $E_{\\widetilde{10}}$ using the formula $E_{\\widetilde{10}}^{(1)} = \\langle \\widetilde{10}^{(0)} | \\mathbf{H}^{(1)} | \\widetilde{10}^{(0)} \\rangle$. Since the state $\\widetilde{10}$ is dominated by the zero-order state with $E^{(0)}=10$, we need to find the matrix element $\\langle \\widetilde{10}^{(0)} | \\mathbf{H}^{(1)} | \\widetilde{10}^{(0)} \\rangle$.\nStep 5:  The matrix element $\\langle \\widetilde{10}^{(0)} | \\mathbf{H}^{(1)} | \\widetilde{10}^{(0)} \\rangle$ can be calculated using the formula $\\langle \\widetilde{10}^{(0)} | \\mathbf{H}^{(1)} | \\widetilde{10}^{(0)} \\rangle = \\left(\\begin{array}{ccc}1 & 0 & 0\\end{array}\\right) \\left(\\begin{array}{ccc}1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 2 \\\\ 0 & 2 & -10\\end{array}\\right) \\left(\\begin{array}{c}1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right) = 1$.\nStep 6:  Therefore, the first-order correction to the energy $E_{\\widetilde{10}}$ is $E_{\\widetilde{10}}^{(1)} = \\langle \\widetilde{10}^{(0)} | \\mathbf{H}^{(1)} | \\widetilde{10}^{(0)} \\rangle = 1$.\nStep 7:  Next, we need to find the second-order correction to the energy $E_{\\widetilde{10}}$ using the formula $E_{\\widetilde{10}}^{(2)} = \\sum_{n \\neq \\widetilde{10}} \\frac{|\\langle n^{(0)} | \\mathbf{H}^{(1)} | \\widetilde{10}^{(0)} \\rangle|^2}{E_{\\widetilde{10}}^{(0)} - E_{n}^{(0)}}$.\nStep 8:  We need to find the matrix elements $\\langle n^{(0)} | \\mathbf{H}^{(1)} | \\widetilde{10}^{(0)} \\rangle$ for $n \\neq \\widetilde{10}$.\nStep 9:  The matrix elements $\\langle n^{(0)} | \\mathbf{H}^{(1)} | \\widetilde{10}^{(0)} \\rangle$ can be calculated using the formula $\\langle n^{(0)} | \\mathbf{H}^{(1)} | \\widetilde{10}^{(0)} \\rangle = \\left(\\begin{array}{ccc}0 & 1 & 0\\end{array}\\right) \\left(\\begin{array}{ccc}1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 2 \\\\ 0 & 2 & -10\\end{array}\\right) \\left(\\begin{array}{c}1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right) = 1$ for $n=0$, and $\\langle n^{(0)} | \\mathbf{H}^{(1)} | \\widetilde{10}^{(0)} \\rangle = \\left(\\begin{array}{ccc}0 & 0 & 1\\end{array}\\right) \\left(\\begin{array}{ccc}1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 2 \\\\ 0 & 2 & -10\\end{array}\\right) \\left(\\begin{array}{c}1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right) = 0$ for $n=-10$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the second-order correction to the energy $E_{\\widetilde{10}}$ is $E_{\\widetilde{10}}^{(2)} = \\sum_{n \\neq \\widetilde{10}} \\frac{|\\langle n^{(0)} | \\mathbf{H}^{(1)} | \\widetilde{10}^{(0)} \\rangle|^2}{E_{\\widetilde{10}}^{(0)} - E_{n}^{(0)}} = \\frac{1^2}{10-0} + \\frac{0^2}{10-(-10)} = \\frac{1}{10}$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the total energy $E_{\\widetilde{10}}$ is $E_{\\widetilde{10}} = E_{\\widetilde{10}}^{(0)} + E_{\\widetilde{10}}^{(1)} + E_{\\widetilde{10}}^{(2)} = 10 + 1 + \\frac{1}{10} = 10.1$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10.1}$"
