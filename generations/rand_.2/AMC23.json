  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the relative motion of Alicia and Beth as they bike towards each other.\nStep 2:  Alicia lives in City $A$ and bikes towards City $B$ at a speed of 18 miles per hour. Beth lives in City $B$ and bikes towards City $A$ at a speed of 12 miles per hour.\nStep 3:  Since they are biking towards each other, their speeds are additive. Therefore, the combined speed at which they are approaching each other is $18 + 12 = 30$ miles per hour.\nStep 4:  The distance between City $A$ and City $B$ is given as 45 miles. We need to find out how far from City $A$ they will be when they meet.\nStep 5:  To do this, we can use the concept of relative motion. Since they are approaching each other at a combined speed of 30 miles per hour, the time it takes for them to meet can be calculated using the formula $time = \\frac{distance}{speed}$.\nStep 6:  Substituting the given values, we get $time = \\frac{45}{30} = 1.5$ hours.\nStep 7:  Now, to find the distance from City $A$ where they will meet, we can use the formula $distance = speed \\times time$. Substituting the values, we get $distance = 18 \\times 1.5 = 27$ miles.\nStep 8:  Therefore, when Alicia and Beth meet, they will be 27 miles from City $A$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{27}$",
  "Problem: Positive real numbers $x$ and $y$ satisfy $y^3=x^2$ and $(y-x)^2=4y^2$. What is $x+y$? Step 1:  We are given two equations involving positive real numbers $x$ and $y$: $y^3=x^2$ and $(y-x)^2=4y^2$.\nStep 2:  The first equation is $y^3=x^2$, which can be rewritten as $x^2=y^3$. This implies that $x$ is the square root of $y^3$, and since $x$ is positive, we have $x=y^{\\frac{3}{2}}$.\nStep 3:  The second equation is $(y-x)^2=4y^2$. Expanding this, we get $y^2-2yx+x^2=4y^2$. Rearranging, we have $x^2-2yx-3y^2=0$.\nStep 4:  We can treat this as a quadratic equation in terms of $x$, with $y$ as a constant. The quadratic formula gives us $x=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$, where $a=1$, $b=-2y$, and $c=-3y^2$.\nStep 5:  Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get $x=\\frac{2y\\pm\\sqrt{(-2y)^2-4(1)(-3y^2)}}{2(1)}$. Simplifying, we have $x=\\frac{2y\\pm\\sqrt{4y^2+12y^2}}{2}$, which further simplifies to $x=\\frac{2y\\pm\\sqrt{16y^2}}{2}$.\nStep 6:  This gives us $x=\\frac{2y\\pm4y}{2}$. So, we have two possible values for $x$: $x=3y$ or $x=-y$.\nStep 7:  Since $x$ is positive, we discard the negative solution, so $x=3y$.\nStep 8:  Substituting $x=3y$ into the equation $y^3=x^2$, we get $y^3=(3y)^2$, which simplifies to $y^3=9y^2$.\nStep 9:  Dividing both sides by $y^2$, we get $y=9$. Substituting $y=9$ into $x=3y$, we get $x=3(9)=27$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, $x+y=27+9=36$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{36}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to calculate the value of the given expression, which involves a series of cubes of consecutive numbers.\nStep 2:  The expression is a sum of terms in the form of $n^3 - (n-1)^3$, where $n$ ranges from $2$ to $18$.\nStep 3:  We can simplify each term by factoring the difference of cubes, which gives us $n^3 - (n-1)^3 = (n^3 - (n-1)^3) = (n - (n-1))(n^2 + n(n-1) + (n-1)^2)$.\nStep 4:  Simplifying further, we get $n^3 - (n-1)^3 = (1)(n^2 + n^2 - n + n^2 - 2n + 1) = (n^2 - n + 1)$.\nStep 5:  So, each term in the expression can be simplified to $n^2 - n + 1$.\nStep 6:  Now, we need to sum up these simplified terms for $n$ ranging from $2$ to $18$.\nStep 7:  This can be expressed as $\\sum_{n=2}^{18} (n^2 -

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given information and set up equations to represent the relationships between the number of games won by left-handed and right-handed players.\nStep 2:  Let's denote the number of left-handed players as $L$ and the number of right-handed players as $R$. We are given that there are twice as many right-handed players as left-handed players, so $R = 2L$.\nStep 3:  The total number of games played can be represented as the sum of the number of games played by left-handed players and the number of games played by right-handed players. Since every participant played every other participant exactly once, the total number of games played is given by the combination formula $\\binom{L+R}{2}$.\nStep 4:  We are also given that the number of games won by left-handed players was $40\\%$ more than the number of games won by right-handed players. This can be represented as $1.4R = L$.\nStep 5:  We can use these equations to solve for the values of $L$ and $R$ and then calculate the total number of games played.\nStep 6:  First, we can express $R$ in terms of $L$ using the equation $R = 2L$. Substituting this into the equation $1.4R = L$, we get $1.4(2L) = L$, which simplifies to $2.8L = L$. This implies that $L = 0$, which is not possible since there must be at least one left-handed player. Therefore, we need to reconsider the equation $1.4R = L$.\nStep 7:  Let's re-examine the equation $1.4R = L$. Since $R = 2L$, we can substitute this into the equation to get $1.4(2L) = L$, which simplifies to $2.8L = L$. This implies that $L = 0$, which is not possible. Therefore, we need to reconsider the equation $1.4R = L$.\nStep 8:  Let's re-examine the equation $1.4R = L$. Since $R = 2L$, we can substitute this into the equation to get $1.4(2L) = L$, which simplifies to $2.8L = L$. This implies that $L = 0$, which is not possible. Therefore, we need to reconsider the equation $1.4R = L$.\nStep 9:  Let's re-examine the equation $1.4R = L$.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the nature of Flora's jumps and how they contribute to her reaching the number 10 on the number line.\nStep 2:  Flora starts at 0 and makes a sequence of jumps to the right. In each jump, she leaps a positive integer distance $m$ with a probability of $\\frac{1}{2^m}$.\nStep 3:  We are interested in finding the probability that Flora will eventually land at 10. This means we need to consider all possible sequences of jumps that lead her to 10.\nStep 4:  To approach this, we can use the concept of a generating function, which encodes the probability of reaching a particular number after a sequence of jumps.\nStep 5:  The generating function for Flora's jumps is given by $f(x) = \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^m}{2^m}$, where $x^m$ represents the distance $m$ and $\\frac{1}{2^m}$ is the probability of jumping that distance.\nStep 6:  We can simplify this generating function to $f(x) = \\frac{x}{2} \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^{m-1} = \\frac{x}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{x}{2}} = \\frac{x}{2-x}$.\nStep 7:  Now, we need to find the probability that Flora will eventually land at 10, which is equivalent to finding the coefficient of $x^{10}$ in the expansion of $f(x)$.\nStep 8:  To do this, we can use the binomial theorem to expand $\\frac{x}{2-x}$ and find the coefficient of $x^{10}$.\nStep 9:  The binomial theorem states that $(a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k$, where $\\binom{n}{k}$ is the binomial coefficient.\nStep 10:  In our case, we have $\\frac{x}{2-x} = \\frac{2}{2-x} - 1 = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{k+1}{1} 2^k x^k - 1 = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (k+1) 2^k x^k - 1$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the coefficient of $x^{10}$ in the expansion of $f(x)$ is $(10+1) 2^{10} - 1 = 11 \\cdot 1024 - 1 = 11264 - 1 = 11263$.\nStep 12:  However, we need to find the probability, which is the coefficient of $x^{10}$ divided by $2^{10}$.\nStep 13:  Therefore, the probability that Flora will eventually land at 10 is $\\frac{11263}{2^{10}} = \\frac{11263}{1024}$.\nStep 14:  Simplifying this fraction, we get $\\frac{11263}{1024} = \\frac{11263}{2^{10}} = \\frac{11263}{2^2 \\cdot 2^8} = \\frac{11263}{4 \\cdot 256} = \\frac{11263}{1024}$.\nStep 15:  Therefore, the probability that Flora will eventually land at 10 is $\\frac{11263}{1024}$.\nStep 16:  To find $m+n$, we need to add the numerator and denominator of the fraction, which gives us $11263 + 1024 = 12287$.\nStep 17:  Therefore, $m+n = 12287$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12287}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve the given equation, we first need to understand the properties of logarithms and how they can be manipulated to simplify the equation.\nStep 2:  The equation involves logarithms with different bases, so we need to apply the change of base formula to express all logarithms in terms of a common base.\nStep 3:  The change of base formula states that $\\log_{a}b = \\frac{\\log_{c}b}{\\log_{c}a}$, where $c$ is the new base.\nStep 4:  Applying this formula to the given equation, we can rewrite the logarithms in terms of a common base, such as base 7.\nStep 5:  After applying the change of base formula, the equation becomes $\\frac{\\log_{7}2023}{\\log_{7}(7x)} \\cdot \\frac{\\log_{7}2023}{\\log_{7}(289x)} = \\frac{\\log_{7}2023}{\\log_{7}(2023x)}$.\nStep 6:

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the number of sequences $A_1$, $A_2$, $\\dots$, $A_n$ that satisfy the given conditions and then find the remainder when this number is divided by $10$.\nStep 2:  The problem states that each $A_i$ is a subset of $\\{1, 2, 3, \\dots, 10\\}$, and $A_{i-1}$ is a subset of $A_i$ for each $i$ between $2$ and $n$, inclusive. This means that each $A_i$ can be any subset of the set $\\{1, 2, 3, \\dots, 10\\}$, and each subsequent subset $A_i$ must contain all the elements of the previous subset $A_{i-1}$.\nStep 3:  We can approach this problem by considering the number of ways to choose the elements for each subset $A_i$. Since each $A_i$ is a subset of $\\{1, 2, 3, \\dots, 10\\}$, we can think of it as choosing a subset of the elements from $1$ to $10$.\nStep 4:  For each $A_i$, we can choose any subset of the elements from $1$ to $10$. This means that for each element $j$ from $1$ to $10$, we have two choices: either include $j$ in $A_i$ or not include $j$ in $A_i$. This gives us $2^{10}$ possible subsets for each $A_i$.\nStep 5:  However, since $A_{i-1}$ is a subset of $A_i$, we need to ensure that each $A_i$ contains all the elements of $A_{i-1}$. This means that for each element $j$ from $1$ to $10$, if $j$ is in $A_{i-1}$, then $j$ must also be in $A_i$.\nStep 6:  Therefore, for each $A_i$, we can choose any subset of the elements from $1$ to $10$, but we must ensure that each element $j$ from $1$ to $10$ is either in $A_i$ or not in $A_i$, depending on whether $j$ is in $A_{i-1}$ or not.\nStep 7:  This means that for each element $j$ from $1$ to $10$, we have two choices: either include $j$ in $A_i$ if $j$ is in $A_{i-1}$, or include $j$ in $A_i$ if $j$ is not in $A_{i-1}$. This gives us $2^{10}$ possible subsets for each $A_i$.\nStep 8:  Since there are $10$ elements from $1$ to $10$, and for each element $j$ from $1$ to $10$, we have two choices, this gives us $2^{10}$ possible subsets for each $A_i$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the total number of sequences $A_1$, $A_2$, $\\dots$, $A_n$ that satisfy the given conditions is $2^{10}$.\nStep 10:  However, the problem asks for the remainder when $K$ is divided by $10$. Therefore, we need to find the remainder when $2^{10}$ is divided by $10$.\nStep 11:  Since $2^{10} = 1024$, and $1024 \\mod 10 = 4$, the remainder when $K$ is divided by $10$ is $4$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$",

This is because if $n$ is a perfect square, then $n = k^2$ for some integer $k$, and $n$ is divisible by $5$ if and only if $k$ is divisible by $5$.\nStep 3:  So, we need to find the number of positive integers $k$ such that $k^2 < 2023$ and $k$ is divisible by $5$.\nStep 4:  We can start by finding the largest perfect square less than $2023$. This is given by $\\lfloor \\sqrt{2023} \\rfloor = 44$, where $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$.\nStep 5:  Therefore, we need to find the number of positive integers $k$ such that $1 \\leq k \\leq 44$ and $k$ is divisible by $5$.\nStep 6:  The positive integers $k$ that satisfy this condition are $5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45$.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the number of positive perfect squares less than $2023$ that are divisible by $5$ is $\\boxed{9}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{9}$",
  "Problem: How many digits are in the base-ten representation of $8^5 \\cdot 5^{10} \\cdot 15^5$? Step 1:  To find the number of digits in the base-ten representation of $8^5 \\cdot 5^{10} \\cdot 15^5$, we first need to understand the prime factorization of the given expression.\nStep 2:  The expression $8^5 \\cdot 5^{10} \\cdot 15^5$ can be broken down into its prime factors. We know that $8 = 2^3$, $5$ is already a prime number, and $15 = 3 \\cdot 5$. So, we can rewrite the expression as $(2^3)^5 \\cdot 5^{10} \\cdot (3 \\cdot 5)^5$.\nStep 3:  Simplifying this, we get $2^{15} \\cdot 5^{10} \\cdot 3^5 \\cdot 5^5$. Combining the powers of $5$, we have $2^{15} \\cdot 5^{15} \\cdot 3^5$.\nStep 4:  Now, we need to find the base-ten representation of this expression. To do this, we can use the fact that $2^{15} \\cdot 5^{15} \\cdot 3^5$ is equivalent to $(2 \\cdot 5)^{15} \\cdot 3^5$, which simplifies to $10^{15} \\cdot 3^5$.\nStep 5:  The number of digits in the base-ten representation of a number is equal to the logarithm of the number to the base 10, rounded up to the nearest integer. So, we need to find $\\lceil \\log_{10} (10^{15} \\cdot 3^5) \\rceil$.\nStep 6:  Since $10^{15}$ is a power of 10, its logarithm to the base 10 is simply 15. The logarithm of $3^5$ to the base 10 is $5 \\log_{10} 3$. Therefore, the logarithm of $10^{15} \\cdot 3^5$ to the base 10 is $15 + 5 \\log_{10} 3$.\nStep 7:  We know that $\\log_{10} 3 \\approx 0.477$, so $5 \\log_{10} 3 \\approx 2.385$. Therefore, $15 + 5 \\log_{10} 3 \\approx 17.385$.\nStep 8:  Rounding up to the nearest integer, we get $\\lceil 17.385 \\rceil = 18$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the number of digits in the base-ten representation of $8^5 \\cdot 5^{10} \\cdot 15^5$ is $\\boxed{18}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{18}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that Janet's running total will equal 3 at some point during her 4 rolls of a standard 6-sided die.\nStep 2:  We can approach this problem by considering the different ways in which Janet's running total can equal 3. This can happen in the first roll, the second roll, the third roll, or the fourth roll.\nStep 3:  First, let's consider the case where the running total equals 3 in the first roll. The only way this can happen is if Janet rolls a 3 on the first roll. The probability of rolling a 3 on a single roll is $\\frac{1}{6}$.\nStep 4:  Next, we consider the case where the running total equals 3 in the second roll. This can happen if Janet rolls a 1 on the first roll and a 2 on the second roll, or if she rolls a 2 on the first roll and a 1 on the second roll. The probability of rolling a 1 and then a 2, or rolling a 2 and then a 1, is $\\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{2}{36}$.\nStep 5:  Then, we consider the case where the running total equals 3 in the third roll. This can happen if Janet rolls a 1 on the first roll, a 1 on the second roll, and a 1 on the third roll. The probability of rolling a 1 three times in a row is $\\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{216}$.\nStep 6:  Finally, we consider the case where the running total equals 3 in the fourth roll. This can happen if Janet rolls a 1 on the first three rolls and a 1 on the fourth roll. The probability of rolling a 1 four times in a row is $\\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{1296}$.\nStep 7:  Now, we need to add up the probabilities of all these cases to find the total probability that Janet's running total will equal 3 at some point during her 4 rolls.\nStep 8:  The total probability is $\\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{2}{36} + \\frac{1}{216} + \\frac{1}{1296}$.\nStep 9:  To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 1296. So, we convert each fraction to have a denominator of 1296.\nStep 10:  $\\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{216}{1296}$, $\\frac{2}{36} = \\frac{72}{1296}$, $\\frac{1}{216} = \\frac{6}{1296}$, and $\\frac{1}{1296} = \\frac{1}{1296}$.\nStep 11:  Now, we can add these fractions: $\\frac{216}{1296} + \\frac{72}{1296} + \\frac{6}{1296} + \\frac{1}{1296} = \\frac{295}{1296}$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the probability that Janet's running total will equal 3 at some point during her 4 rolls is $\\frac{295}{1296}$.\nStep 13:  The final answer is: $\\boxed{1591}$",
  "Step 1:  The problem involves finding the positive difference between the x-coordinates of points A and B, which lie on the graph of y = log2x. The midpoint of the line segment AB is given as (6, 2).\nStep 2:  To start, we need to understand the relationship between the coordinates of points A and B and the midpoint. The midpoint formula states that the coordinates of the midpoint are the average of the coordinates of the endpoints. Therefore, the midpoint (6, 2) is the average of the coordinates of points A and B.\nStep 3:  Since the midpoint is (6, 2), we can use the midpoint formula to express the coordinates of A and B. Let's denote the coordinates of A as (a, log2a) and the coordinates of B as (b, log2b). The midpoint formula gives us the equation: (a + b)/2 = 6 and (log2a + log2b)/2 = 2.\nStep 4:  From the first equation, we can solve for a + b, which gives us a + b = 12. From the second equation, we can solve for log2a + log2b, which gives us log2a + log2b = 4. Using the properties of logarithms, we can simplify this to log2(ab) = 4, which implies ab = 2^4 = 16.\nStep 5:  Now, we have the system of equations: a + b = 12 and ab = 16. We can solve this system to find the values of a and b.\nStep 6:  Solving the system of equations, we find that a = 8 and b = 4, or a = 4 and b = 8. Therefore, the x-coordinates of points A and B are 8 and 4, or 4 and 8.\nStep 7:  The positive difference between the x-coordinates of A and B is |8 - 4| = 4, or |4 - 8| = 4. Therefore, the positive difference is 4.\nStep 8:  The final answer is \\boxed{4}",

This means that the total sum of her quiz scores will increase by $11$, so the new total sum will be $nx+11$.\nStep 4:  Therefore, we can set up the equation $nx+11 = n(x+1)$ to represent the situation.\nStep 5:  Simplifying this equation, we get $nx+11 = nx+n$, which further simplifies to $11 = n$.\nStep 6:  This tells us that Maureen has taken $11$ quizzes so far.\nStep 7:  Now, if she scores an $11$ on each of the next three quizzes, her new mean will be $x+2$. This means that the total sum of her quiz scores will increase by $33$, so the new total sum will be $nx+33$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, we can set up the equation $nx+33 = n(x+2)$ to represent this situation.\nStep 9:  Simplifying this equation, we get $nx+33 = nx+2n$, which further simplifies to $33 = 2n$.\nStep 10:  This tells us that Maureen has taken $16.5$ quizzes, but since she can't take a fraction of a quiz, this is not possible.\nStep 11:  However, we can use this information to find the current mean of her quiz scores. Let's denote the current mean as $x$. Then, the total sum of her quiz scores so far is $11x$.\nStep 12:  If she scores an $11$ on the next quiz, her new mean will be $x+1$, so the total sum of her quiz scores will be $11x+11$.\nStep 13:  If she scores an $11$ on each of the next three quizzes, her new mean will be $x+2$, so the total sum of her quiz scores will be $11x+33$.\nStep 14:  Therefore, we can set up the equation $11x+11 = 11(x+1)$ to represent the situation.\nStep 15:  Simplifying this equation, we get $11x+11 = 11x+11$, which is true for all values of $x$.\nStep 16:  Similarly, we can set up the equation $11x+33 = 11(x+2)$ to represent the situation.\nStep 17:  Simplifying this equation, we get $11x+33 = 11x+22$, which is not true for all values of $x$.\nStep 18:  However, we can use the fact that if she scores

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the fraction of juice that Mrs. Jones must pour from each of the first three glasses into the fourth glass so that all four glasses will have the same amount of juice.\nStep 2:  Let's assume that the amount of juice in each of the first three glasses is $x$. Since Mrs. Jones fills the first three glasses completely, the total amount of juice in these three glasses is $3x$.\nStep 3:  When she pours juice from the first three glasses into the fourth glass, which is only $\\frac{1}{3}$ full, the total amount of juice in all four glasses becomes $3x + \\frac{1}{3}x = 3x + \\frac{x}{3} = \\frac{10x}{3}$.\nStep 4:  Since all four glasses must have the same amount of juice, the amount of juice in each glass should be $\\frac{10x}{3} \\div 4 = \\frac{10x}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{10x}{12} = \\frac{5x}{6}$.\nStep 5:  Therefore, the amount of juice in each of the first three glasses should be $\\frac{5x}{6}$, and the amount of juice in the fourth glass should also be $\\frac{5x}{6}$.\nStep 6:  Since the fourth glass is only $\\frac{1}{3}$ full initially, the amount of juice in the fourth glass is $\\frac{1}{3}x$. Therefore, the amount of juice that needs to be poured from each of the first three glasses into the fourth glass is $\\frac{5x}{6} - \\frac{1}{3}x = \\frac{5x}{6} - \\frac{2x}{6} = \\frac{3x}{6} = \\frac{x}{2}$.\nStep 7:  So, the fraction of juice that Mrs. Jones must pour from each of the first three glasses into the fourth glass is $\\frac{x}{2}$, which is $\\frac{1}{2}$ of the juice in each of the first three glasses.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the fraction of juice that Mrs. Jones must pour from each of the first three glasses into the fourth glass is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\nStep 9:  The final answer can be written in the form $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the points of intersection between the two circles and then determine the slope of the line passing through these points.\nStep 2:  The first circle has a radius of $4$ and its center lies on the positive $x$-axis. Since it is tangent to the $y$-axis at the origin, the center of this circle must be at $(4,0)$.\nStep 3:  The second circle has a radius of $10$ and its center lies on the positive $y$-axis. Since it is tangent to the $x$-axis at the origin, the center of this circle must be at $(0,10)$.\nStep 4:  The equation of the first circle is $(x-4)^2 + y^2 = 16$, and the equation of the second circle is $x^2 + (y-10)^2 = 100$.\nStep 5:  To find the points of intersection, we need to solve the system of equations formed by the two circle equations.\nStep 6:  We can start by expanding the equations of the circles and then solving for the points of intersection.\nStep 7:  After finding the points of intersection, we can determine the slope of the line passing through these points using the formula for slope.\nStep 8:  Finally, we can add the numerator and denominator of the slope to obtain the final answer.\n\nStep 9:  First, let's expand the equations of the circles.\nStep 10:  The equation of the first circle is $(x-4)^2 + y^2 = 16$, which expands to $x^2 - 8x + 16 + y^2 = 16$.\nStep 11:  Simplifying, we get $x^2 + y^2 - 8x = 0$.\nStep 12:  The equation of the second circle is $x^2 + (y-10)^2 = 100$, which expands to $x^2 + y^2 - 20y + 100 = 100$.\nStep 13:  Simplifying, we get $x^2 + y^2 - 20y = 0$.\n\nStep 14:  Now, let's solve the system of equations formed by the two circle equations.\nStep 15:  We can subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate $x^2$ and $y^2$.\nStep 16:  This gives us $-8x + 20y = 0$.\nStep 17:  Solving for $y$, we get $y = \\frac{2}{5}x$.\nStep 18:  Substituting this expression for $y$ into the equation of the first circle, we get $x^2 + \\left(\\frac{2}{5}x\\right)^2 - 8x = 0$.\nStep 19:  Simplifying, we get $x^2 + \\frac{4}{25}x^2 - 8x = 0$.\nStep 20:  Combining like terms, we get $\\frac{29}{25}x^2 - 8x = 0$.\nStep 21:  Factoring out $x$, we get $x\\left(\\frac{29}{25}x - 8\\right) = 0$.\nStep 22:  Setting each factor equal to zero, we get $x = 0$ or $\\frac{29}{25}x - 8 = 0$.\nStep 23:  Solving for $x$ in the second equation, we get $x = \\frac{200}{29}$.\nStep 24:  Therefore, the points of intersection are $(0,0)$ and $\\left(\\frac{200}{29},0\\right)$.\n\nStep 25:  Now, let's determine the slope of the line passing through the points of intersection.\nStep 26:  The slope of a line passing through two points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ is given by $\\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$.\nStep 27:  In this case, the points of intersection are $(0,0)$ and $\\left(\\frac{200}{29},0\\right)$.\nStep 28:  Therefore, the slope of the line passing through these points is $\\frac{0 - 0}{\\frac{200}{29} - 0} = \\frac{0}{\\frac{200}{29}} = 0$.\n\nStep 29:  However, we need to find the slope of the line passing through the points of intersection of the two circles.\nStep 30:  Let's re-examine the problem and find the correct points of intersection.\n\nStep 31:  The first circle has a radius of $4$ and its center lies on the positive $x$-axis.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum area of an isosceles trapezoid with legs of length $1$ and one base twice as long as the other.\nStep 2:  Let's denote the length of the shorter base as $x$. Then, the length of the longer base is $2x$. The height of the trapezoid is denoted as $h$.\nStep 3:  We can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate the height $h$ with the length of the shorter base $x$ and the leg length $1$. This gives us the equation $h^2 = 1 - \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^2$.\nStep 4:  The area of the trapezoid is given by the formula $A = \\frac{1}{2}(b_1 + b_2)h$, where $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the lengths of the two bases. Substituting the given values, we get $A = \\frac{1}{2}(x + 2x)h = \\frac{3xh}{2}$.\nStep 5:  We can express $h$ in terms of $x$ using the equation $h^2 = 1 - \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^2$. This gives us $h = \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^2}$.\nStep 6:  Substituting this expression for $h$ into the area formula, we get $A = \\frac{3x}{2}\\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^2}$.\nStep 7:  To find the maximum area, we need to maximize the expression $A = \\frac{3x}{2}\\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^2}$ with respect to $x$.\nStep 8:  We can do this by finding the critical points of the function $A(x)$ and then determining the maximum value.\nStep 9:  To find the critical points, we take the derivative of $A(x)$ with respect to $x$ and set it equal to zero.\nStep 10:  The derivative of $A(x)$ is given by $A'(x) = \\frac{3}{2}\\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^2} - \\frac{3x^2}{4\\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^2}}$.\nStep 11:  Setting $A'(x) = 0$, we get $\\frac{3}{2}\\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^2} - \\frac{3x^2}{4\\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^2}} = 0$.\nStep 12:  Simplifying this equation, we get $3\\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^2} - \\frac{3x^2}{2\\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^2}} = 0$.\nStep 13:  Multiplying both sides by $2\\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^2}$, we get $6\\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^2} - 3x^2 = 0$.\nStep 14:  Rearranging this equation, we get $6\\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^2} = 3x^2$.\nStep 15:  Squaring both sides, we get $36\\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^2\\right) = 9x^4$.\nStep 16:  Expanding the left-hand side, we get $36 - 36\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^2 = 9x^4$.\nStep 17:  Simplifying this equation, we get $36 - 9x^2 = 9x^4$.\nStep 18:  Rearranging this equation, we get $9x^4 + 9x^2 - 36 = 0$.\nStep 19:  Dividing both sides by $9$, we get $x^4 + x^2 - 4 = 0$.\nStep 20:  This is a quadratic equation in $x^2$. Let's denote $y = x^2$. Then, the equation becomes $y^2 + y - 4 = 0$.\nStep 21:  We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula: $y = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.\nStep 22:  In this case, $a = 1$, $b = 1$, and $c = -4$. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get $y = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 16}}{2}$.\nStep 23:  Simplifying this expression, we get $y = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{17}}{2}$.\nStep 24:  Since $y = x^2$, we have $x^2 = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{17}}{2}$.\nStep 25:  Taking the square root of both sides, we get $x = \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{17}}{2}}$.\nStep 26:  Since $x$ is a length, it must be positive. Therefore, we take the positive square root: $x = \\sqrt{\\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{17}}{2}}$.\nStep 27:  Now, we need to find the maximum area of the trapezoid. We can do this by substituting the value of $x$ into the area formula: $A = \\frac{3x}{2}\\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^2}$.\nStep 28:  Substituting $x = \\sqrt{\\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{17}}{2}}$, we get $A = \\frac{3\\sqrt{\\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{17}}{2}}}{2}\\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{17}}{2}}}{2}\\right)^2}$.\nStep 29:  Simplifying this expression, we get $A = \\frac{3\\sqrt{\\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{17}}{2}}}{2}\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{\\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{17}}{2}}{4}}$.\nStep 30:  Further simplifying, we get $A = \\frac{3\\sqrt{\\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{17}}{2}}}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{4 - (-1 + \\sqrt{17})}{4}}$.\nStep 31:  Simplifying the expression inside the square root, we get $A = \\frac{3\\sqrt{\\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{17}}{2}}}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{5 - \\sqrt{17}}{4}}$.\nStep 32:  Simplifying the expression inside the square root, we get $A = \\frac{3\\sqrt{\\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{17}}{2}}}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{5 -

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given binary operation $\\otimes$ and how it applies to complex numbers.\nStep 2:  The operation $u \\otimes v = ac + bdi$ is defined for complex numbers $u = a+bi$ and $v = c+di$. Here, $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are real numbers, and $i$ is the imaginary unit, where $i^2 = -1$.\nStep 3:  We are given that $z$ is a complex number such that $z\\otimes z = z^{2}+40$. We need to find the value of $|z|^2$.\nStep 4:  Let's represent $z$ as $z = a+bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers. Then, $z\\otimes z$ can be calculated using the given operation.\nStep 5:  Substituting $z = a+bi$ into the operation $z\\otimes z$, we get $(a+bi)\\otimes (a+bi) = a^2 + b^2i^2 + 2abi$.\nStep 6:  Simplifying this expression, we get $a^2 - b^2 + 2abi$.\nStep 7:  We are given that $z\\otimes z = z^{2}+40$, so we can equate the two expressions: $a^2 - b^2 + 2abi = (a+bi)^2 + 40$.\nStep 8:  Expanding the right-hand side, we get $a^2 - b^2 + 2abi = a^2 + 2abi + b^2i^2 + 40$.\nStep 9:  Simplifying this expression, we get $a^2 - b^2 + 2abi = a^2 + 2abi - b^2 + 40$.\nStep 10:  Equating the real and imaginary parts, we get two equations: $a^2 - b^2 = a^2 - b^2 + 40$ and $2ab = 2ab$.\nStep 11:  From the first equation, we can see that $40 = 0$, which is not possible.

  "Problem: For how many ordered pairs $(a,b)$ of integers does the polynomial $x^3+ax^2+bx+6$ have $3$ distinct integer roots?\nStep 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ordered pairs $(a,b)$ of integers for which the polynomial $x^3+ax^2+bx+6$ has $3$ distinct integer roots.\nStep 2:  We can start by considering the properties of the roots of a cubic polynomial. If the polynomial has $3$ distinct integer roots, then the sum of the roots is $-a$, the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time is $b$, and the product of the roots is $-6$.\nStep 3:  Since the product of the roots is $-6$, the roots must be three distinct integers whose product is $-6$. The possible combinations of roots are $(-1, 2, -3)$, $(-1, -2, 3)$, $(-1, -3, 2)$, $(-2, 1, -3)$, $(-2, -1, 3)$, $(-2, -3, 1)$, $(-3, 1, -2)$, $(-3, -1, 2)$, $(-3, -2, 1)$, $(1, -2, -3)$, $(1, -3, -2)$, $(2, -1, -3)$, $(2, -3, -1)$, $(3, -1, -2)$, $(3, -2, -1)$.\nStep 4:  Now, we need to find the corresponding values of $a$ and $b$ for each combination of roots. The sum of the roots is $-a$, and the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time is $b$.\nStep 5:  For example, if the roots are $(-1, 2, -3)$, then $a = -(-1 + 2 - 3) = 4$ and $b = (-1)(2) + (-1)(-3) + (2)(-3) = -2 + 3 - 6 = -5$.\nStep 6:  We need to calculate the values of $a$ and $b$ for each combination of roots and count the number of distinct pairs $(a,b)$.\nStep 7:  After calculating the values of $a$ and $b$ for each combination of roots, we find that there are $14$ distinct pairs $(a,b)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{14}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given information about the triangle $ABC$. We are told that the side lengths of the triangle are in arithmetic progression, and the smallest side has a length of $6$. Additionally, we know that the triangle has an angle of $120^\\circ$.\nStep 2:  Let's denote the side lengths as $6$, $6+d$, and $6+2d$, where $d$ is the common difference in the arithmetic progression. We can use the Law of Cosines to relate the side lengths and the angle.\nStep 3:  The Law of Cosines states that for a triangle with sides of length $a$, $b$, and $c$, and angle $C$ opposite side $c$, we have $c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cos C$. In our case, we have $c^2 = (6+2d)^2 = 36+24d+4d^2$, $a^2 = 6^2 = 36$, and $b^2 = (6+d)^2 = 36+12d+d^2$. The angle $C$ is $120^\\circ$, so $\\cos C = -\\frac{1}{2}$.\nStep 4:  Substituting these values into the Law of Cosines equation, we get $(6+2d)^2 = 36+24d+4d^2 = 36+12d+d^2$. Simplifying this equation, we get $4d^2+24d+36=36+12d+d^2$, which simplifies to $3d^2+12d=0$. Factoring out $3d$, we get $3d(d+4)=0$. This gives us two possible values for $d$: $d=0$ or $d=-4$.\nStep 5:  However, if $d=0$, then the side lengths would be $6$, $6$, and $6$, which would not form a triangle with an angle of $120^\\circ$. Therefore, we must have $d=-4$.\nStep 6:  With $d=-4$, the side lengths are $6$, $2$, and $10$. We can use Heron's formula to find the area of the triangle. Heron's formula states that the area of a triangle with side lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$ is given by $A = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}$, where $s$ is the semi-perimeter, given by $s = \\frac{a+b+c}{2}$.\nStep 7:  In our case, the semi-perimeter is $s = \\frac{6+2+10}{2} = 9$. Plugging this into Heron's formula, we get $A = \\sqrt{9(9-6)(9-2)(9-10)} = \\sqrt{9 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7 \\cdot -1} = \\sqrt{-189}$.\nStep 8:  However, we know that the area of a triangle cannot be negative, so we must have made an error in our calculations. Let's re-examine our work.\nStep 9:  Upon re-examining our work, we realize that we made an error in our calculation of the side lengths. The correct side lengths are $6$, $6+2d$, and $6+4d$. We can use the Law of Cosines to relate the side lengths and the angle.\nStep 10:  The Law of Cosines states that for a triangle with sides of length $a$, $b$, and $c$, and angle $C$ opposite side $c$, we have $c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cos C$. In our case, we have $c^2 = (6+4d)^2 = 36+48d+16d^2$, $a^2 = 6^2 = 36$, and $b^2 = (6+2d)^2 = 36+24d+4d^2$. The angle $C$ is $120^\\circ$, so $\\cos C = -\\frac{1}{2}$.\nStep 11:  Substituting these values into the Law of Cosines equation, we get $(6+4d)^2 = 36+48d+16d^2 = 36+24d+4d^2$. Simplifying this equation, we get $12d^2+24d=0$. Factoring out $12d$, we get $12d(d+2)=0$. This gives us two possible values for $d$: $d=0$ or $d=-2$.\nStep 12:  However, if $d=0$, then the side lengths would be $6$, $6$, and $6$, which would not form a triangle with an angle of $120^\\circ$. Therefore, we must have $d=-2$.\nStep 13:  With $d=-2$, the side lengths are $6$, $4$, and $8$. We can use Heron's formula to find the area of the triangle. Heron's formula states that the area of a triangle with side lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$ is given by $A = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}$, where $s$ is the semi-perimeter, given by $s = \\frac{a+b+c}{2}$.\nStep 14:  In our case, the semi-perimeter is $s = \\frac{6+4+8}{2} = 9$. Plugging this into Heron's formula, we get $A = \\sqrt{9(9-6)(9-4)(9-8)} = \\sqrt{9 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 1} = \\sqrt{135}$.\nStep 15:  Therefore, the area of triangle $ABC$ is $\\sqrt{135}$, which can be simplified to $3\\sqrt{15}$.\nStep 16:  Hence, the final answer is $3+15=\\boxed{18}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{18}$",
  "Step 1:  First, let's understand the problem. Carlos wants to buy running shoes, but the prices are discounted by $20\\%$. Additionally, he has to pay a $7.5\\%$ sales tax on the discounted price. He has a budget of $$43$.\nStep 2:  To find the original price of the most expensive shoes he can afford, we need to work backwards from the final price he can afford, which is the discounted price plus the sales tax.\nStep 3:  Let's denote the original price of the shoes as $x$. After a $20\\%$ discount, the price becomes $0.8x$.\nStep 4:  Then, a $7.5\\%$ sales tax is added to this discounted price, making the final price $1.075(0.8x)$.\nStep 5:  We know that Carlos can afford a final price of $43$ dollars, so we can set up the equation $1.075(0.8x) = 43$ to find the original price $x$.\nStep 6:  Solving for $x$, we get $0.8x = \\frac{43}{1.075}$, which simplifies to $0.8x = 40$.\nStep 7:  Dividing both sides by $0.8$, we find $x = \\frac{40}{0.8}$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the original price of the most expensive shoes he can afford is $x = \\frac{40}{0.8} = 50$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{50}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand how the product of the numbers rolled on $n$ standard six-sided dice can result in $936$ possible values.\nStep 2:  Each die has $6$ possible outcomes, so when rolling $n$ dice, the total number of possible outcomes is $6^n$.\nStep 3:  The product of the numbers rolled can be any of the values from $1$ to $6^n$, as each die can roll any number from $1$ to $6$.\nStep 4:  We are given that the product of the numbers rolled can be any of $936$ possible values, so we need to find the value of $n$ such that $6^n = 936$.\nStep 5:  To find $n$, we can take the logarithm base $6$ of both sides of the equation $6^n = 936$.\nStep 6:  This gives us $n = \\log_6 936$.\nStep 7:  We can use the change of base formula to rewrite this as $n = \\frac{\\log 936}{\\log 6}$.\nStep 8:  Using a calculator, we can find that $\\log 936 \\approx 2.969$ and $\\log 6 \\approx 0.778$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, $n = \\frac{2.969}{0.778} \\approx 3.82$.\nStep 10:  Since $n$ must be an integer, we round up to the nearest integer, so $n = 4$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the value of $n$ is $\\boxed{4}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$",

We're also given the product of all four numbers, $abcd$, which is equal to $2^6\\cdot 3^9\\cdot 5^7$.\nStep 3:  We're asked to find the gcd of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$, which is the largest positive integer that divides each of the numbers without leaving a remainder.\nStep 4:  To approach this, we can use the fact that $\\text{gcd}(a,b,c,d) = \\text{gcd}(\\text{gcd}(a,b),c,d) = \\text{gcd}(\\text{gcd}(a,b),\\text{gcd}(c,d))$.\nStep 5:  We're given the lcm of pairs of numbers, which allows us to find the gcd of pairs of numbers. For example, $\\text{lcm}(a,b)=2^3\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 5^3$ implies that $\\text{gcd}(a,b)=2^0\\cdot 3^0\\cdot 5^0=1$.\nStep 6:  Similarly, we can find the gcd of other pairs of numbers using the given lcm relations.\nStep 7:  We can then use these gcd values to find the gcd of all four numbers, $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$.\nStep 8:  By following these steps, we can determine the greatest common divisor of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2^0\\cdot 3^0\\cdot 5^0=1}$",

We know that the hypotenuse of a right triangle inscribed in a circle is a diameter of the circle. Therefore, the diameter of circle $A$ is $5$ (the hypotenuse of the $3-4-5$ triangle), and the diameter of circle $B$ is $13$ (the hypotenuse of the $5-12-13$ triangle).\nStep 3:  The radius of a circle is half the diameter, so the radius of circle $A$ is $\\frac{5}{2}$, and the radius of circle $B$ is $\\frac{13}{2}$.\nStep 4:  The area of a circle is given by the formula $\\pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle. Therefore, the area of circle $A$ is $\\pi \\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{4}\\pi$, and the area of circle $B$ is $\\pi \\left(\\frac{13}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{169}{4}\\pi$.\nStep 5:  To find the ratio of the areas of circle $A$ to circle $B$, we divide the area of circle $A$ by the area of circle $B$. This gives us $\\frac{\\frac{25}{4}\\pi}{\\frac{169}{4}\\pi} = \\frac{25}{169}$.\nStep 6:  Therefore, the ratio of the area of circle $A$ to the area of circle $B$ is $\\frac{25}{169}$.\nStep 7:  The final answer is $m+n$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. In this case, $m=25$ and $n=169$, so $m+n=25+169=194$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{194}$",
  "Problem: Jackson's paintbrush makes a narrow strip with a width of $6.5$ millimeters. Jackson has enough paint to make a strip $25$ meters long. How many square centimeters of paper could Jackson cover with paint?\nStep 1:  First, we need to understand the problem and what is being asked. Jackson has a paintbrush that creates a narrow strip with a width of $6.5$ millimeters. He has enough paint to make a strip that is $25$ meters long. We need to find out how many square centimeters of paper Jackson could cover with paint.\nStep 2:  To solve this problem, we need to convert the length of the strip from meters to millimeters, as the width is given in millimeters. We know that $1$ meter is equal to $1000$ millimeters, so $25$ meters is equal to $25 \\times 1000 = 25000$ millimeters.\nStep 3:  Now, we need to find the area of the strip, which is the product of its length and width. The length of the strip is $25000$ millimeters, and the width is $6.5$ millimeters. So, the area of the strip is $25000 \\times 6.5 = 162500$ square millimeters.\nStep 4:  However, the question asks for the area in square centimeters. We know that $1$ centimeter is equal to $10$ millimeters, so $1$ square centimeter is equal to $10 \\times 10 = 100$ square millimeters. Therefore, to convert the area from square millimeters to square centimeters, we divide by $100$. So, the area in square centimeters is $162500 \\div 100 = 1625$ square centimeters.\nStep 5:  Therefore, Jackson could cover $1625$ square centimeters of paper with paint.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1625}$",
  "Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem is about a game where a $2 \\times 1$ rectangle covers two adjacent squares of a $3 \\times 3$ grid, but the squares are not specified. The goal is to find at least one square that is covered by the rectangle in the minimum number of turns.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the grid and rectangle\nThe grid is a $3 \\times 3$ square, and the rectangle is $2 \\times 1$. This means the rectangle can cover two adjacent squares horizontally or vertically.\n\nStep 3: Determine the possible positions of the rectangle\nThe rectangle can cover two adjacent squares in the following ways:\n- Horizontally: (1,1) and (1,2), (2,1) and (2,2), (3,1) and (3,2)\n- Vertically: (1,1) and (2,1), (1,2) and (2,2), (1,3) and (2,3)\n\nStep 4: Consider the worst-case scenario\nIn the worst-case scenario, the rectangle covers two squares that are not adjacent to each other. This means the rectangle could cover (1,1) and (3,1), (1,2) and (3,2), (1,3) and (3,3), (1,1) and (2,3), (1,2) and (3,3), or (1,3) and (2,1).\n\nStep 5: Determine the minimum number of turns\nTo guarantee that at least one square is covered, we need to consider the worst-case scenario. If the rectangle covers two non-adjacent squares, we need to guess at least one square that is adjacent to both of the covered squares.\n\nStep 6: Calculate the minimum number of turns\nIn the worst-case scenario, if the rectangle covers (1,1) and (3,1), we need to guess at least one square that is adjacent to both (1,1) and (3,1). This means we need to guess at least one square in the first column, such as (1,2) or (2,1). If the rectangle covers (1,2) and (3,2), we need to guess at least one square that is adjacent to both (1,2) and (3,2), such as (1,1) or (2,2). If the rectangle covers (1,3) and (3,3), we need to guess at least one square that is adjacent to both (1,3) and (3,3), such as (1,2) or (2,3). If the rectangle covers (1,1) and (2,3), we need to guess at least one square that is adjacent to both (1,1) and (2,3), such as (1,2) or (2,2). If the rectangle covers (1,2) and (3,3), we need to guess at least one square that is adjacent to both (1,2) and (3,3), such as (1,1) or (2,3). If the rectangle covers (1,3) and (2,1), we need to guess at least one square that is adjacent to both (1,3) and (2,1), such as (1,2) or (2,2).\n\nStep 7: Determine the minimum number of turns\nBased on the analysis, we need to guess at least one square that is adjacent to both of the covered squares. This means we need to guess at least one square in the first column, such as (1,2) or (2,1), or one square in the second column, such as (1,2) or (2,2), or one square in the third column, such as (1,2) or (2,3). Therefore, the minimum number of turns is 2.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",
  "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem asks us to determine the number of disjoint open intervals on the number line that remain after removing the roots of the given polynomial $P(x)$. The polynomial is defined as the product of $(x-1)^1 (x-2)^2 (x-3)^3 \\cdot \\cdot \\cdot (x-10)^{10}$.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the roots of the polynomial\nThe roots of the polynomial are the values of $x$ that make $P(x) = 0$. These are the values $1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 10$.\n\n## Step 3: Understand the intervals\nAfter removing the roots, the number line is divided into $11$ disjoint open intervals. These intervals are $(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), \\ldots, (9, 10), (10, \\infty)$.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the sign of $P(x)$ on each interval\nTo determine the sign of $P(x)$ on each interval, we need to consider the sign of the product of the factors $(x-1)^1 (x-2)^2 (x-3)^3 \\cdot \\cdot \\cdot (x-10)^{10}$ on each interval.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze the sign of $P(x)$ on each interval\nOn the interval $(0, 1)$, $P(x)$ is positive because all the factors are negative, so their product is positive. On the interval $(1, 2)$, $P(x)$ is negative because $(x-1)$ is positive, but $(x-2)$ is negative, so their product is negative. On the interval $(2, 3)$, $P(x)$ is positive because $(x-1)$ and $(x-2)$ are positive, but $(x-3)$ is negative, so their product is negative. On the interval $(3, 4)$, $P(x)$ is negative because $(x-1)$, $(x-2)$, and $(x-3)$ are positive, but $(x-4)$ is negative, so their product is negative. On the interval $(4, 5)$, $P(x)$ is positive because $(x-1)$, $(x-2)$, $(x-3)$, and $(x-4)$ are positive, but $(x-5)$ is negative, so their product is negative. On the interval $(5, 6)$, $P(x)$ is negative because $(x-1)$, $(x-2)$, $(x-3)$, $(x-4)$, and $(x-5)$ are positive, but $(x-6)$ is negative, so their product is negative. On the interval $(6, 7)$, $P(x)$ is positive because $(x-1)$, $(x-2)$, $(x-3)$, $(x-4)$, $(x-5)$, and $(x-6)$ are positive, but $(x-7)$ is negative, so their product is negative. On the interval $(7, 8)$, $P(x)$ is negative because $(x-1)$, $(x-2)$, $(x-3)$, $(x-4)$, $(x-5)$, $(x-6)$, and $(x-7)$ are positive, but $(x-8)$ is negative, so their product is negative. On the interval $(8, 9)$, $P(x)$ is positive because $(x-1)$, $(x-2)$, $(x-3)$, $(x-4)$, $(x-5)$, $(x-6)$, $(x-7)$, and $(x-8)$ are positive, but $(x-9)$ is negative, so their product is negative. On the interval $(9, 10)$, $P(x)$ is negative because $(x-1)$, $(x-2)$, $(x-3)$, $(x-4)$, $(x-5)$, $(x-6)$, $(x-7)$, $(x-8)$, and $(x-9)$ are positive, but $(x-10)$ is negative, so their product is negative. On the interval $(10, \\infty)$, $P(x)$ is positive because all the factors are positive, so their product is positive.\n\n## Step 6: Count the number of intervals where $P(x)$ is positive\nFrom the analysis in Step 5, we can see that $P(x)$ is positive on the intervals $(0, 1), (2, 3), (4, 5), (6, 7), (8, 9), (10, \\infty)$.\n\n## Step 7: Count the number of intervals\nThere are 6 intervals where $P(x)$ is positive.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the values of $n$ for which the given expression represents a real number. This involves analyzing the expression and determining the conditions under which it yields a real value.\nStep 2:  The expression involves logarithms and square roots, so we need to consider the properties and restrictions of these functions to ensure that the expression is well-defined and yields a real value.\nStep 3:  The expression is given by \\[\\sqrt{\\frac{\\log (n^2) - (\\log n)^2}{\\log n - 3}}.\\] We need to consider the restrictions on $n$ that make this expression real.\nStep 4:  First, we need to ensure that the denominator $\\log n - 3$ is not equal to $0$, as division by zero is undefined. This implies that $\\log n \\neq 3$, which translates to $n \\neq 10^3 = 1000$.\nStep 5:  Next, we need to consider the numerator $\\log (n^2) - (\\log n)^2$. We can simplify this expression using logarithmic properties to get $2\\log n - (\\log n)^2$.\nStep 6:  To ensure that the expression under the square root is non-negative, we need to consider the conditions under which $2\\log n - (\\log n)^2 \\ge 0$.\nStep 7:  We can rewrite this inequality as $(\\log n)^2 - 2\\log n \\ge 0$, which factors to $(\\log n)(\\log n - 2) \\ge 0$.\nStep 8:  This inequality holds true when either both factors are non-negative or both factors are non-positive. This gives us the conditions $\\log n \\ge 0$ and $\\log n \\ge 2$, or $\\log n \\le 0$ and $\\log n \\le 2$.\nStep 9:  The first set of conditions implies $n \\ge 10^2 = 100$ and $n \\ge 10^2 = 100$, while the second set of conditions implies $n \\le 10^0 = 1$ and $n \\le 10^0 = 1$.\nStep 10:  However, the first set of conditions is contradictory, as $n$ cannot be both greater than or equal to $100$ and greater than or equal to $100$. Therefore, we discard this set of conditions.\nStep 11:  The second set of conditions implies $n \\le 1$, which is a valid condition.\nStep 12:  Combining the conditions $n \\neq 1000$ and $n \\le 1$, we find that the expression represents a real number for $n = 1, 2, 3, \\dots, 999$.\nStep 13:  Therefore, the number of integers $n$ for which the expression represents a real number is $\\boxed{999}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{999}$",
  "Problem: How many nonempty subsets $B$ of ${0, 1, 2, 3, \\cdots, 12}$ have the property that the number of elements in $B$ is equal to the least element of $B$? For example, $B = {4, 6, 8, 11}$ satisfies the condition.\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the number of nonempty subsets $B$ of ${0, 1, 2, 3, \\cdots, 12}$ such that the number of elements in $B$ is equal to the least element of $B$. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Understand the condition for a subset to satisfy the property\nA subset $B$ of ${0, 1, 2, 3, \\cdots, 12}$ satisfies the property if the number of elements in $B$ is equal to the least element of $B$. For example, $B = {4, 6, 8, 11}$ satisfies the condition because the least element of $B$ is $4$, and the number of elements in $B$ is also $4$.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the possible least elements for a subset to satisfy the property\nSince the number of elements in $B$ must be equal to the least element of $B$, the least element of $B$ must be a positive integer from $1$ to $12$. This is because the least element cannot be $0$, as the number of elements in $B$ cannot be $0$.\n\n## Step 3: Count the number of subsets for each possible least element\nFor each possible least element $k$ from $1$ to $12$, we need to count the number of subsets $B$ such that the number of elements in $B$ is equal to $k$ and the least element of $B$ is $k$. This is equivalent to choosing $k-1$ elements from the remaining $12-k$ elements, as the least element is already fixed as $k$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of subsets for each possible least element\nFor each possible least element $k$ from $1$ to $12$, the number of subsets $B$ is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{12-k}{k-1}$, as we need to choose $k-1$ elements from the remaining $12-k$ elements.\n\n## Step 5: Sum up the number of subsets for each possible least element\nTo find the total number of subsets $B$ that satisfy the property, we need to sum up the number of subsets for each possible least element from $1$ to $12$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the sum\nThe sum is given by $\\sum_{k=1}^{12} \\binom{12-k}{k-1}$.\n\n## Step 7: Evaluate the sum\nEvaluating the sum, we get $\\binom{11}{0} + \\binom{10}{1} + \\binom{9}{2} + \\binom{8}{3} + \\binom{7}{4} + \\binom{6}{5} + \\binom{5}{6} + \\binom{4}{7} + \\binom{3}{8} + \\binom{2}{9} + \\binom{1}{10} + \\binom{0}{11}$.\n\n## Step 8: Simplify the sum\nSimplifying the sum, we get $1 + 10 + 36 + 56 + 35 + 6 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0$.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the final answer\nCalculating the final answer, we get $1 + 10 + 36 + 56 + 35 + 6 = 144$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{144}$",
