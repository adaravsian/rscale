  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of relative motion and how to calculate the time it takes for Alicia and Beth to meet.\nStep 2:  First, we note that the distance between Cities $A$ and $B$ is $45$ miles. Alicia bikes towards $B$ at a speed of $18$ miles per hour, while Beth bikes towards $A$ at a speed of $12$ miles per hour.\nStep 3:  When they meet, the sum of the distances traveled by Alicia and Beth will be equal to the total distance between the cities, which is $45$ miles.\nStep 4:  Let's denote the time it takes for them to meet as $t$ hours. In this time, Alicia will have traveled a distance of $18t$ miles, and Beth will have traveled a distance of $12t$ miles.\nStep 5:  Since the sum of their distances traveled is equal to the total distance between the cities, we can set up the equation $18t + 12t = 45$ to represent this situation.\nStep 6:  Solving for $t$, we get $30t = 45$, which gives us $t = \\frac{45}{30} = \\frac{3}{2}$ hours.\nStep 7:  Now that we have the time it takes for them to meet, we can calculate the distance traveled by Alicia. The distance traveled by Alicia is given by the product of her speed and the time taken, which is $18 \\times \\frac{3}{2} = 27$ miles.\nStep 8:  Therefore, when they meet, Alicia will be $27$ miles from City $A$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{27}$",
  "Step 1:  We are given two equations involving the positive real numbers $x$ and $y$: $y^3=x^2$ and $(y-x)^2=4y^2$.\nStep 2:  To solve for $x$ and $y$, we can start by manipulating the second equation to simplify it. We can expand the squared term to get $y^2 - 2yx + x^2 = 4y^2$.\nStep 3:  Rearranging the terms, we get $x^2 - 2yx - 3y^2 = 0$. This is a quadratic equation in terms of $x$, and we can solve for $x$ using the quadratic formula.\nStep 4:  The quadratic formula states that for an equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the solutions for $x$ are given by $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.\nStep 5:  Applying this to our equation, we have $a = 1$, $b = -2y$, and $c = -3y^2$. Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get $x = \\frac{2y \\pm \\sqrt{4y^2 + 12y^2}}{2} = \\frac{2y \\pm 4y}{2}$.\nStep 6:  This simplifies to $x = y \\pm 2y = 3y$ or $x = y - 2y = -y$.\nStep 7:  However, since $x$ and $y$ are positive real numbers, the solution $x = -y$ is not valid. Therefore, we are left with $x = 3y$.\nStep 8:  Substituting $x = 3y$ into the first equation $y^3 = x^2$, we get $y^3 = (3y)^2 = 9y^2$.\nStep 9:  This simplifies to $y^3 - 9y^2 = 0$, which can be factored as $y^2(y - 9) = 0$.\nStep 10:  Since $y$ is a positive real number, we can conclude that $y = 9$.\nStep 11:  Substituting $y = 9$ into the equation $x = 3y$, we get $x = 3(9) = 27$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the sum of $x$ and $y$ is $x + y = 27 + 9 = \\boxed{36}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{36}$",

We are given that there are twice as many right-handed players as left-handed players, so we can express this as $R = 2L$.\nStep 3:  The total number of games played can be calculated using the combination formula, which is given by $\\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$, where $n$ is the total number of players. In this case, the total number of games played is $\\frac{(L+R)(L+R-1)}{2}$.\nStep 4:  We are also given that the number of games won by left-handed players was $40\\%$ more than the number of games won by right-handed players. This can be expressed as $1.4G_R = G_L$, where $G_R$ is the number of games won by right-handed players and $G_L$ is the number of games won by left-handed players.\nStep 5:  We can use the fact that the total number of games played is the sum of the games won by left-handed and right-handed players, which gives us the equation $G_L + G_R = \\frac{(L+R)(L+R-1)}{2}$.\nStep 6:  Substituting $R = 2L$ into the equation $G_L + G_R = \\frac{(L+R)(L+R-1)}{2}$, we get $G_L + G_R = \\frac{(3L)(2L-1)}{2}$.\nStep 7:  We also know that $G_L = 1.4G_R$, so we can substitute this into the equation $G_L + G_R = \\frac{(3L)(2L-1)}{2}$ to get $1.4G_R + G_R = \\frac{(3L)(2L-1)}{2}$.\nStep 8:  Simplifying this equation, we get $2.4G_R = \\frac{(3L)(2L-1)}{2}$.\nStep 9:  Solving for $G_R$, we find that $G_R = \\frac{(3L)(2L-1)}{4.8}$.\nStep 10:  Substituting $R = 2L$ into the equation $G_R = \\frac{(3L)(2L-1)}{4.8}$, we get $G_R = \\frac{(6L)(2L-1)}{4.8}$.\nStep 11:  Simplifying this equation, we find that $G_R = \\frac{L(2L-1)}{0.8}$.\nStep 12:  We are given that the number of games won by left-handed players was $40\\%$ more than the number of games won by right-handed players, so we can express this as $G_L = 1.4G_R$.\nStep 13:  Substituting $G_R = \\frac{L(2L-1)}{0.8}$ into the equation $G_L = 1.4G_R$, we get $G_L = 1.4 \\times \\frac{L(2L-1)}{0.8}$.\nStep 14:  Simplifying this equation, we find that $G_L = \\frac{7L(2L-1)}{4}$.\nStep 15:  We are given that the total number of games played is the sum of the games won by left-handed and right-handed players, which gives us the equation $G_L + G_R = \\frac{(L+R)(L+R-1)}{2}$.\nStep 16:  Substituting $R = 2L$ into the equation $G_L + G_R = \\frac{(L+R)(L+R-1)}{2}$, we get $G_L + G_R = \\frac{(3L)(2L-1)}{2}$.\nStep 17:  We also know that $G_L = \\frac{7L(2L-1)}{4}$ and $G_R = \\frac{L(2L-1)}{0.8}$.\nStep 18:  Substituting these expressions into the equation $G_L + G_R = \\frac{(3L)(2L-1)}{2}$, we get $\\frac{7L(2L-1)}{4} + \\frac{L(2L-1)}{0.8} = \\frac{(3L)(2L-1)}{2}$.\nStep 19:  Simplifying this equation, we find that $\\frac{7L(2L-1)}{4} + \\frac{5L(2L-1)}{4} = \\frac{3L(2L-1)}{2}$.\nStep 20:  Combining like terms, we get $\\frac{12L(2L-1)}{4} = \\frac{3L(2L-1)}{2}$.\nStep 21:  Dividing both sides by $\\frac{3L(2L-1)}{2}$, we get $\\frac{12}{3} = \\frac{2}{2}$.\nStep 22:  Simplifying this equation, we find that $4 = 1$.\nStep 23:  However, this is a contradiction, as $4 \\neq 1$.\nStep 24:  Therefore, our initial assumption that $R = 2L$ must be incorrect.\nStep 25:  Let's re-examine the given information and set up equations to represent the relationships between the number of games won by left-handed and right-handed players.\nStep 26:  We are given that there are twice as many right-handed players as left-handed players, so we can express this as $R = 2L$.\nStep 27:  However, this is not the only possible relationship between the number of left-handed and right-handed players.\nStep 28:  Let's consider the case where $R = 3L$.\nStep 29:  We can use the fact that the total number of games played is the sum of the games won by left-handed and right-handed players, which gives us the equation $G_L + G_R = \\frac{(L+R)(L+R-1)}{2}$.\nStep 30:  Substituting $R = 3L$ into the equation $G_L + G_R = \\frac{(L+R)(L+R-1)}{2}$, we get $G_L + G_R = \\frac{(4L)(3L-1)}{2}$.\nStep 31:  We also know that $G_L = 1.4G_R$, so we can substitute this into the equation $G_L + G_R = \\frac{(4L)(3L-1)}{2}$ to get $1.4G_R + G_R = \\frac{(4L)(3L-1)}{2}$.\nStep 32:  Simplifying this equation, we get $2.4G_R = \\frac{(4L)(3L-1)}{2}$.\nStep 33:  Solving for $G_R$, we find that $G_R = \\frac{(4L)(3L-1)}{4.8}$.\nStep 34:  Substituting $R = 3L$ into the equation $G_R = \\frac{(4L)(3L-1)}{4.8}$, we get $G_R = \\frac{(12L)(3L-1)}{4.8}$.\nStep 35:  Simplifying this equation, we find that $G_R = \\frac{L(3L-1)}{0.4}$.\nStep 36:  We are given that the number of games won by left-handed players was $40\\%$ more than the number of games won by right-handed players, so we can express this as $G_L = 1.4G_R$.\nStep 37:  Substituting $G_R = \\frac{L(3L-1)}{0.4}$ into the equation $G_L = 1.4G_R$, we get $G_L = 1.4 \\times \\frac{L(3L-1)}{0.4}$.\nStep 38:  Simplifying this equation, we find that $G_L = \\frac{7L(3L-1)}{0.4}$.\nStep 39:  We are given that the total number of games played is the sum of the games won by left-handed and right-handed players, which gives us the equation $G_L + G_R = \\frac{(L+R)(L+R-1)}{2}$.\nStep 40:  Substituting $R = 3L$ into the equation $G_L + G_R = \\frac{(L+R)(L+R-1)}{2}$, we get $G_L + G_R = \\frac{(4L)(3L-1)}{2}$.\nStep 41:  We also know that $G_L = \\frac{7L(3L-1)}{0.4}$ and $G_R = \\frac{",

  "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the behavior of the polynomial $P(x)$ on the given intervals.\n## Step 2:  The polynomial $P(x)$ is defined as the product of linear factors of the form $(x - k)^{k}$, where $k$ ranges from $1$ to $10$.\n## Step 3:  We are interested in determining the number of intervals on which $P(x)$ is positive after the roots of the polynomial are removed from the number line.\n## Step 4:  To do this, we need to consider the sign of $P(x)$ on each of the $11$ disjoint open intervals created by the removal of the roots.\n## Step 5:  We can start by analyzing the behavior of $P(x)$ on each interval and determine the sign of the polynomial on each interval.\n## Step 6:  We note that the sign of $P(x)$ on an interval is determined by the product of the signs of the linear factors $(x - k)^{k}$ for $k$ ranging from $1$ to $10$.\n## Step 7:  We can use the fact that the sign of a product of numbers is determined by the number of negative numbers in the product.\n## Step 8:  Therefore, we need to count the number of negative linear factors on each interval to determine the sign of $P(x)$ on that interval.\n## Step 9:  We can then use this information to determine the number of intervals on which $P(x)$ is positive.\n## Step 10:  By analyzing the behavior of $P(x)$ on each interval, we can determine the number of intervals on which the polynomial is positive.\n## Step 11:  We can then use this information to find the final answer.\n\n## Step 12:  We can start by analyzing the behavior of $P(x)$ on the interval $(1, 2)$.\n## Step 13:  On this interval, the linear factor $(x - 1)^1$ is negative, while the other linear factors are positive.\n## Step 14:  Therefore, the product of the signs of the linear factors on this interval is negative, and $P(x)$ is negative on the interval $(1, 2)$.\n## Step 15:  We can repeat this analysis for each of the remaining intervals to determine the sign of $P(x)$ on each interval.\n\n## Step 16:  After analyzing the behavior of $P(x)$ on each interval, we can count the number of intervals on which $P(x)$ is positive.\n## Step 17:  We find that $P(x)$ is positive on the intervals $(2, 3)$, $(4, 5)$, $(6, 7)$, $(8, 9)$, and $(10, \\infty)$.\n## Step 18:  Therefore, the number of intervals on which $P(x)$ is positive is $\\boxed{5}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$",
  "Step 1:  To find the values of $n$ for which the given expression represents a real number, we need to analyze the expression step by step.\nStep 2:  The expression involves logarithms and square roots, so we'll start by simplifying the expression using the properties of logarithms.\nStep 3:  We're given the expression \\[\\sqrt{\\frac{\\log (n^2) - (\\log n)^2}{\\log n - 3}}.\\]\nStep 4:  Using the property of logarithms that $\\log a^b = b \\log a$, we can simplify $\\log (n^2)$ to $2 \\log n$.\nStep 5:  Substituting this into the expression, we get \\[\\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\log n - (\\log n)^2}{\\log n - 3}}.\\]\nStep 6:  Next, we can factor the numerator to obtain \\[\\sqrt{\\frac{(\\log n)(2 - \\log n)}{\\log n - 3}}.\\]\nStep 7:  Now, we need to consider the conditions under which this expression represents a real number. For the expression to be real, the radicand (the number inside the square root) must be nonnegative, and the denominator must be nonzero.\nStep 8:  The radicand is nonnegative if $(\\log n)(2 - \\log n) \\ge 0$, and the denominator is nonzero if $\\log n - 3 \\neq 0$.\nStep 9:  We can solve the inequality $(\\log n)(2 - \\log n) \\ge 0$ by considering the intervals where the expression is nonnegative. This inequality holds when $0 \\le \\log n \\le 2$.\nStep 10:  Additionally, we need to ensure that $\\log n - 3 \\neq 0$, which means $\\log n \\neq 3$. This translates to $n \\neq 10^3 = 1000$.\nStep 11:  Combining these conditions, we find that the expression represents a real number for $100 < n < 1000$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the number of integers $n$ for which the expression represents a real number is the number of integers in the interval $100 < n < 1000$.\nStep 13:  The integers in this interval are $101, 102, \\dots, 999$, which gives us a total of $999 - 101 + 1 = \\boxed{899}$ integers.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{899}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the given inequality and how it defines a region in the coordinate plane.\nStep 2:  The inequality $| | x | - 1 | + | | y | - 1 | \\le 1$ involves absolute values, which means the expression inside the absolute value can be either positive or negative.\nStep 3:  We can start by considering the cases when $x \\ge 0$ and $y \\ge 0$, which simplifies the inequality to $|x - 1| + |y - 1| \\le 1$.\nStep 4:  This inequality defines a region in the first quadrant of the coordinate plane. We can further break it down into cases based on the values of $x$ and $y$ to understand the boundaries of this region.\nStep 5:  When $x \\ge 1$ and $y \\ge 1$, the inequality becomes $x - 1 + y - 1 \\le 1$, which simplifies to $x + y \\le 3$. This defines a triangle in the first quadrant with vertices at $(0,0)$, $(3,0)$, and $(0,3)$.\nStep 6:  When $x \\ge 1$ and $y < 1$, the inequality becomes $x - 1 + 1 - y \\le 1$, which simplifies to $x - y \\le 1$. This defines a triangle in the first quadrant with vertices at $(0,0)$, $(1,0)$, and $(0,1)$.\nStep 7:  When $x < 1$ and $y \\ge 1$, the inequality becomes $1 - x + 1 - y \\le 1$, which simplifies to $-x - y \\le 1$. This defines a triangle in the first quadrant with vertices at $(0,0)$, $(0,1)$, and $(1,0)$.\nStep 8:  When $x < 1$ and $y < 1$, the inequality becomes $1 - x + 1 - y \\le 1$, which simplifies to $-x - y \\le 1$. This defines a triangle in the first quadrant with vertices at $(0,0)$, $(0,1)$, and $(1,0)$.\nStep 9:  By considering these cases, we can visualize the region defined by the inequality as a square with side length 2, centered at the origin.\nStep 10:  The area of this square can be calculated as the square of its side length, which is $2^2 = 4$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the area of the region defined by the inequality is $\\boxed{4}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$"
