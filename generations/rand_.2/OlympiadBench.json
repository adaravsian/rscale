  "Let $C$ be a $4n$-point configuration in an open unit square $U$. We can assume that the points of $C$ are in general position, i.e., no four points are collinear. We will show that $\\mu \\le \\frac{1}{4n^2}$.\nLet $P_1, P_2, \\dots, P_{4n}$ be the points of $C$. For each $i$, let $Q_i$ be the point in the interior of the side of $U$ opposite to $P_i$ such that $P_i Q_i$ is parallel to the side of $U$. Let $R_i$ be the rectangle with sides $P_i Q_i$ and $Q_i P_{i+1}$, where $P_{i+1}$ is the point of $C$ to the right of $P_i$. Let $S_i$ be the rectangle with sides $P_i Q_i$ and $Q_i P_{i+2}$, where $P_{i+2}$ is the point of $C$ below $P_i$. Let $T_i$ be the rectangle with sides $P_i Q_i$ and $Q_i P_{i+3}$, where $P_{i+3}$ is the point of $C$ to the left of $P_i$.\nWe claim that at least one of the rectangles $R_i$, $S_i$, $T_i$ contains exactly one point of $C$. To see this, suppose that $P_i$ and $P_{i+1}$ are in the same rectangle $R_i$. If $P_{i+2}$ is in $R_i$, then $P_i, P_{i+1}, P_{i+2}$ are collinear, a contradiction. If $P_{i+2}$ is in $S_i$, then $P_i, P_{i+1}, P_{i+2}$ are collinear, a contradiction. If $P_{i+2}$ is in $T_i$, then $P_i, P_{i+1}, P_{i+2}$ are collinear, a contradiction. Therefore, $P_{i+2}$ is in $R_i$, and $P_i$ and $P_{i+1}$ are in $S_i$. Similarly, $P_{i+3}$ is in $R_i$, and $P_i$ and $P_{i+1}$ are in $T_i$.

This gives us a recursive definition for the sequence $x_n$.\nStep 3:  Next, we're asked to find the largest possible $k$ such that, for some positive integer $a$, the numbers $y_1, \\ldots, y_k$ are all prime, where $y_n = 2^{x_n} - 1$.\nStep 4:  We can start by computing the first few terms of the sequences $x_n$ and $y_n$ to see if we can identify any patterns or properties that might help us determine the largest possible $k$.\nStep 5:  We find that $x_1 = a$, $x_2 = 2a + 1$, $x_3 = 5a + 3$, and $x_4 = 21a + 11$. Then, we calculate the corresponding values of $y_n$ using the formula $y_n = 2^{x_n} - 1$.\nStep 6:  By examining the values of $y_n$, we notice that $y_1 = 2^a - 1$, $y_2 = 2^{2a + 1} - 1$, $y_3 = 2^{5a + 3} - 1$, and $y_4 = 2^{21a + 11} - 1$.\nStep 7:  We observe that $y_4$ is divisible by $y_1$, which means that $y_4$ cannot be prime. This leads us to conclude that the largest possible $k$ is $3$.\nStep 8:  To confirm this, we need to show that there exists a positive integer $a$ such that $y_1, y_2,$ and $y_3$ are all prime.\nStep 9:  We can choose $a = 1$, which gives us $y_1 = 1$, $y_2 = 3$, and $y_3 = 11$. Since all these values are prime, we have found a valid value of $a$ that satisfies the condition.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the largest possible $k$ is indeed $\\boxed{3}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$",

This results in a configuration of $n$ arrows.\nStep 3:  We can approach this problem by considering the possible arrangements of the arrows and then counting the number of good configurations.\nStep 4:  First, we note that the arrows can be oriented in two ways: clockwise or counterclockwise. This gives us two possibilities for each pair of points.\nStep 5:  We can then consider the arrangement of the arrows in a circular manner, with each arrow pointing from one point to another. This forms a circular permutation of the $n$ points.\nStep 6:  We can then consider the possible arrangements of the arrows in a circular manner, with each arrow pointing from one point to another. This forms a circular permutation of the $n$ points.\nStep 7:  We can then use the concept of circular permutations to count the number of possible arrangements of the arrows.\nStep 8:  Next, we need to consider the condition that no two arrows cross and that there are no arrows $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\\overrightarrow{CD}$ such that $ABCD$ is a convex quadrangle oriented clockwise.\nStep 9:  We can use the concept of \"bad\" configurations to count the number of configurations that do not meet these conditions.\nStep 10:  By considering the possible arrangements of the arrows and counting the number of good configurations, we can determine the total number of good configurations.\nStep 11:  We can then use the inclusion-exclusion principle to count the number of good configurations.\nStep 12:  Finally, we can calculate the total number of good configurations by considering the possible arrangements of the arrows and applying the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2^{n-1}}$",
  "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to determine the largest number of dominoes that can be placed on a rectangular board with $m$ rows and $2n$ columns, following the given conditions.\n## Step 2:  The first condition states that each domino must cover exactly two adjacent cells of the board. This means that we can place a domino on each pair of adjacent cells.\n## Step 3:  The second condition specifies that no two dominoes should overlap, which implies that each cell can be covered by at most one domino.\n## Step 4:  The third condition requires that no two dominoes should form a $2 \\times 2$ square. This means that we cannot place two dominoes in such a way that they share a common cell.\n## Step 5:  The fourth condition states that the bottom row of the board must be completely covered by $n$ dominoes.\n## Step 6:  To maximize the number of dominoes, we need to consider the arrangement of dominoes on the board. We can start by placing dominoes on the bottom row, as required by the fourth condition.\n## Step 7:  Since the bottom row has $2n$ cells, we can place $n$ dominoes on it, covering $2n$ cells in total.\n## Step 8:  Now, we need to consider the remaining cells in the board. We have $m-1$ rows above the bottom row, each with $2n$ cells.\n## Step 9:  To maximize the number of dominoes, we should place them in such a way that each row has the maximum number of dominoes possible.\n## Step 10:  Since each domino covers two cells, we can place at most $n$ dominoes in each row, covering $2n$ cells.\n## Step 11:  However, we need to consider the condition that no two dominoes should form a $2 \\times 2$ square. This means that we cannot place two dominoes in the same column.\n## Step 12:  To satisfy this condition, we can place dominoes in an alternating pattern, where each domino is placed in a different column.\n## Step 13:  By doing so, we can place at most $n$ dominoes in each row, covering $2n$ cells, without violating the condition.\n## Step 14:  Therefore, the maximum number of dominoes that can be placed on the board is $n$ dominoes in the bottom row, and $n$ dominoes in each of the remaining $m-1$ rows.\n## Step 15:  This gives us a total of $n + n(m-1) = n(1 + m - 1) = n \\cdot m$ dominoes.\n## Step 16:  However, we need to consider the condition that the bottom row must be completely covered by $n$ dominoes.\n## Step 17:  This means that we cannot place any additional dominoes in the bottom row, so the total number of dominoes remains $n \\cdot m$.\n## Step 18:  Therefore, the largest number of dominoes that can be placed on the board is $\\boxed{mn}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{mn}$",

This means that $p$ divides $2a$ if and only if $p$ divides $b$. Since $p$ is a prime, this means that $p$ divides $2a$ if and only if $p$ divides $a$.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to consider the different configurations of napkins on the table and determine the largest value of $k$ that can be achieved.\nStep 2:  First, we need to understand the constraints of the problem. The table is a square of 2011 by 2011 cells, and each napkin covers a square of 52 by 52 cells. This means that the total number of napkins that can be placed on the table is $\\frac{2011^2}{52^2} = 61^2 + 1$.\nStep 3:  We are asked to find the largest value of $k$ such that all cells in a $k \\times k$ subtable contain the same nonzero number. This means that we need to consider the different configurations of napkins and determine the maximum value of $k$ that satisfies this condition.\nStep 4:  We can start by considering the case where the number of napkins in each cell is the same. In this case, the maximum value of $k$ is achieved when the number of napkins in each cell is 1. This gives us a $k \\times k$ subtable with all cells containing the number 1.\nStep 5:  Next, we need to consider the case where the number of napkins in each cell is different. In this case, we need to find the maximum value of $k$ such that all cells in a $k \\times k$ subtable contain the same nonzero number.\nStep 6:  To do this, we can use the Pigeonhole Principle, which states that if $n$ items are put into $m$ containers, with $n > m$, then at least one container must contain more than one item. In this case, we can use the Pigeonhole Principle to show that the maximum value of $k$ is 2011.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the largest value of $k$ that can be achieved is $\\boxed{2011}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2011}$",

We need to find the maximal possible value of the sum $S=\\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i} x_{i+2}$.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the constraints\nThe given constraint is $x_{i}+x_{i+1}+x_{i+2} \\leq 1$ for all $i=1, \\ldots, 100$. This constraint will be used to derive an upper bound for the sum $S$.\n\n## Step 3: Derive an upper bound for the sum $S$\nWe can rewrite the constraint as $x_{i+2} \\leq 1 - x_{i} - x_{i+1}$. Multiplying both sides by $x_{i}$, we get $x_{i}x_{i+2} \\leq x_{i} - x_{i}^2 - x_{i}x_{i+1}$.

  "## Step 1: Understand the constraints of the problem\nWe have a 100x100 chessboard and need to place 2500 chess kings on it. The constraints are that no two kings can be placed in squares sharing a common vertex, and each row and each column must contain exactly 25 kings.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the pattern of king placement\nTo satisfy the constraints, the kings must be placed in a way that they are not adjacent to each other. This means that each king must be placed in a square that is not adjacent to any other king. Given the constraints, the only way to achieve this is to place the kings in a checkerboard pattern.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to place the kings in the first row\nSince each row must contain exactly 25 kings, we can choose 25 squares out of the 100 squares in the first row to place the kings. This can be done in $\\binom{100}{25}$ ways.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to place the kings in the remaining rows\nOnce the kings are placed in the first row, the remaining rows must also contain exactly 25 kings. Since the kings are placed in a checkerboard pattern, the kings in the remaining rows are determined by the placement in the first row. Therefore, there is only one way to place the kings in the remaining rows.\n\n## Step 5: Account for the rotational and reflection symmetries\nSince the problem considers two arrangements to be different if they differ by rotation or reflection, we need to divide the total number of arrangements by the number of possible rotations and reflections. There are 8 possible rotations (including the identity rotation) and 8 possible reflections, resulting in a total of 16 symmetries.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total number of arrangements\nThe total number of arrangements is the number of ways to place the kings in the first row, which is $\\binom{100}{25}$. However, we need to divide this by the number of symmetries, which is 16.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the final answer\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{\\binom{100}{25}}{16}}$",

This expression is always positive for all real values of $x$.\n## Step 4:  Now, let's consider the right-hand side of the equation, which is the sum of squares of polynomials $f_{1}, f_{2}, \\ldots, f_{n}$. Since the sum of squares of real numbers is always non-negative, the right-hand side of the equation is also non-negative for all real values of $x$.\n## Step 5:  However, we need to find the smallest $n$ for which the equation holds true.

We can label the vertices of the triangle as A, B, and C, where AB and AC are the odd sides.\n## Step 5:  Since AB and AC are odd sides, the number of sides between A and B, and between A and C, must be odd. This implies that the number of sides between B and C must also be odd.\n## Step 6:  Therefore, the triangle must be isosceles with two odd sides if and only if the number of sides between B and C is odd.\n## Step 7:  Now, let's consider the total number of triangles that can be formed with the given 2003 nonintersecting diagonals. We can use the fact that the number of triangles formed by a set of nonintersecting diagonals is equal to the number of diagonals plus one.\n## Step 8:  This gives us a total of 2004 triangles. However, we need to find the maximum possible number of isosceles triangles with two odd sides.\n## Step 9:  To maximize the number of isosceles triangles, we need to minimize the number of triangles with two even sides. This can be achieved by maximizing the number of triangles with one odd side and one even side.\n## Step 10:  We can do this by choosing the 2003 nonintersecting diagonals such that they form a set of triangles with one odd side and one even side.\n## Step 11:  This can be visualized as a tree with 2004 vertices, where each vertex represents a triangle, and each edge represents a diagonal.\n## Step 12:  By choosing the 2003 nonintersecting diagonals in this way, we can ensure that the maximum possible number of isosceles triangles with two odd sides is achieved.\n## Step 13:  Therefore, the maximum possible number of isosceles triangles with two odd sides is equal to the number of vertices in the tree, which is 1003.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1003}$",

  "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the conditions under which Luciano can draw tangent segments on the blackboard.\n## Step 2:  The problem states that there are 2017 mutually external circles drawn on the blackboard, with no two circles being tangent and no three circles sharing a common tangent.\n## Step 3:  We are asked to find all possible numbers of tangent segments when Luciano stops drawing.\n## Step 4:  Let's consider the process of drawing tangent segments. Each time Luciano draws a tangent segment, it connects two circles, and this process continues until no more tangent segments can be drawn.\n## Step 5:  We can relate the number of tangent segments to the number of circles. When Luciano draws a tangent segment, it connects two circles, effectively creating a new \"circle\" that is tangent to the two original circles.\n## Step 6:  This new \"circle\" is essentially a point where the tangent segment touches the two original circles. This point is a common tangent point for the two circles.\n## Step 7:  Therefore, the number of tangent segments is related to the number of circles and the number of common tangent points.\n## Step 8:  We can use the concept of combinations to find the number of tangent segments. The number of tangent segments is given by the combination of the number of circles taken 2 at a time, denoted as $\\binom{n}{2}$, where $n$ is the number of circles.\n## Step 9:  In this case, we have 2017 circles, so the number of tangent segments is $\\binom{2017}{2}$.\n## Step 10:  Additionally, we need to consider the fact that each tangent segment connects two circles, so we need to divide the result by 2 to avoid counting each segment twice.\n## Step 11:  Therefore, the total number of tangent segments is $\\frac{\\binom{2017}{2}}{2}$.\n## Step 12:  We can simplify this expression to find the final answer.\n## Step 13:  By simplifying the expression, we get $\\frac{2017 \\cdot 2016}{2 \\cdot 2} = 2017 \\cdot 504 = 1,017,168$.\n## Step 14:  However, we also need to consider the case where no tangent segments are drawn, which corresponds to the number 0.\n## Step 15:  Therefore, the possible numbers of tangent segments when Luciano stops drawing are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211, 212, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217, 218, 219, 220, 221, 222, 223, 224, 225, 226, 227, 228, 229, 230, 231, 232, 233, 234, 235, 236, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241, 242, 243, 244, 245, 246, 247, 248, 249, 250, 251, 252, 253, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 259, 260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269, 270, 271, 272, 273, 274, 275, 276, 277, 278, 279, 280, 281, 282, 283, 284, 285, 286, 287, 288, 289, 290, 291, 292, 293, 294, 295, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 308, 309, 310, 311, 312, 313, 314, 315, 316, 317, 318, 319, 320, 321, 322, 323, 324, 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, 330, 331, 332, 333, 334, 335, 336, 337, 338, 339, 340, 341, 342, 343, 344, 345, 346, 347, 348, 349, 350, 351, 352, 353, 354, 355, 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361, 362, 363, 364, 365, 366, 367, 368, 369, 370, 371, 372, 373, 374, 375, 376, 377, 378, 379, 380, 381, 382, 383, 384, 385, 386, 387, 388, 389, 390, 391, 392, 393, 394, 395, 396, 397, 398, 399, 400, 401, 402, 403, 404, 405, 406, 407, 408, 409, 410, 411, 412, 413, 414, 415, 416, 417, 418, 419, 420, 421, 422, 423, 424, 425, 426, 427, 428, 429, 430, 431, 432, 433, 434, 435, 436, 437, 438, 439, 440, 441, 442, 443, 444, 445, 446, 447, 448, 449, 450, 451, 452, 453, 454, 455, 456, 457, 458, 459, 460, 461, 462, 463, 464, 465, 466, 467, 468, 469, 470, 471, 472, 473, 474, 475, 476, 477, 478, 479, 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488, 489, 490, 491, 492, 493, 494, 495, 496, 497, 498, 499, 500, 501, 502, 503, 504,",

The minimum number of knights that can be placed is 1, as we can place one knight in a corner of the labyrinth.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the maximum number of knights that can be placed\nTo find the maximum number of knights that can be placed, we need to consider the maximum number of intersections that can be created in the labyrinth.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given information and use geometric properties to find the possible values of $BT/BM$.\nStep 2:  We start by considering the properties of the given circle $\\omega$ and its intersection points with the sides of triangle $ABC$.\nStep 3:  Let's denote the intersection of $BP$ and $CQ$ as $D$. Since $BP$ and $CQ$ are chords of the circle, we can use the power of a point theorem to relate the lengths of $BP$, $CQ$, and $BM$.\nStep 4:  The power of a point theorem states that for a point $P$ outside a circle with points of intersection $X$ and $Y$ with the circle, the product of the lengths $PX$ and $PY$ is constant for any choice of $X$ and $Y$.\nStep 5:  Applying this theorem to point $B$, we get $BP \\cdot BQ = BM \\cdot BD$.\nStep 6:  Additionally, since $T$ is the midpoint of $BQ$, we have $BQ = 2BT$.\nStep 7:  Substituting this into the equation $BP \\cdot BQ = BM \\cdot BD$, we obtain $BP \\cdot 2BT = BM \\cdot BD$.\nStep 8:  We also know that $BP = BQ = BT$ due to the properties of the parallelogram $BPQT$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, we can simplify the equation to $2BT^2 = BM \\cdot BD$.\nStep 10:  Since $BD = BT$, we can further simplify the equation to $2BT^2 = BM \\cdot BT$.\nStep 11:  This gives us the relationship $2BT = BM$, which directly relates the lengths of $BT$ and $BM$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the possible values of $BT/BM$ are determined by the ratio of $BT$ to $BM$.\nStep 13:  We can express this ratio as $BT/BM = 1/2$.\nStep 14:  Hence, the final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$",
  "Problem: Determine all triples $(a, b, c)$ of positive integers for which $a b-c, b c-a$, and $c a-b$ are powers of 2 .\n\nStep 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find all triples $(a, b, c)$ of positive integers for which $a b-c, b c-a$, and $c a-b$ are powers of 2.\nStep 2:  We start by considering the given expressions $a b-c, b c-a$, and $c a-b$ and try to manipulate them to get some useful insights.\nStep 3:  Adding these expressions together, we get $(a-b)(b-c)(c-a)$. This expression is equal to $- (a b-c)(b c-a)(c a-b)$.\nStep 4:  Since each of the expressions $a b-c, b c-a$, and $c a-b$ is a power of 2, their product is also a power of 2. Therefore, $(a-b)(b-c)(c-a)$ is a power of 2.\nStep 5:  We also know that $a, b,$ and $c$ are positive integers, so $a-b, b-c,$ and $c-a$ are all integers. This implies that $(a-b)(b-c)(c-a)$ is a power of 2 that is the product of three integers.\nStep 6:  The only way for the product of three integers to be a power of 2 is if two of the integers are 1 and the third is a power of 2. This leads us to the conclusion that exactly two of $a-b, b-c,$ and $c-a$ are equal to 1.\nStep 7:  Without loss of generality, let's assume that $a-b=1$ and $b-c=1$. This gives us $a=b+1$ and $b=c+1$.\nStep 8:  Substituting $a=b+1$ into the expression $c a-b$, we get $c (b+1)-b = c b+c-b = (c-1) b+c$. This expression must be a power of 2.\nStep 9:  Since $b$ is a positive integer, we can conclude that $c-1$ and $c$ are both positive integers. Therefore, $(c-1) b+c$ is a power of 2 that is the sum of two positive integers.\nStep 10:  The only way for the sum of two positive integers to be a power of 2 is if one of the integers is 1 and the other is a power of 2. This leads us to the conclusion that $c-1=1$ and $c$ is a power of 2.\nStep 11:  Solving for $c$, we find that $c=2$. Substituting this value of $c$ back into the expressions $a=b+1$ and $b=c+1$, we get $a=3$ and $b=3$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the only solution to the given problem is $(a, b, c) = (3, 3, 2)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

For example, $5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120$. Given that $b!$ is a factorial, it is always a positive integer.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the equation $a^{p}=b !+p$\nSince $p$ is a prime number, it is only divisible by 1 and itself. This means that $a^{p}$ will always be a multiple of $p$ because $a$ is raised to a power that is a multiple of $p$. On the other hand, $b!$ is a product of consecutive integers, and $p$ is a prime number. Therefore, $p$ will be a factor of $b!$ if and only if $p \\leq b$.\n\n## Step 4: Consider the case when $p \\leq b$\nIf $p \\leq b$, then $p$ is a factor of $b!$, and we can rewrite the equation as $a^{p} = b! + p = b! + p \\cdot 1$. This implies that $a^{p} - p = b!$, which means that $a^{p} - p$ is a factorial.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze the properties of $a^{p} - p$\nSince $a^{p} - p$ is a factorial, it must be a positive integer. However, $a^{p}$ is a multiple of $p$, and subtracting $p$ from it will result in a number that is not a multiple of $p$. This means that $a^{p} - p$ cannot be a factorial if $p$ is a prime number greater than 2.\n\n## Step 6: Consider the case when $p = 2$\nIf $p = 2$, then the equation becomes $a^{2} = b! + 2$. Since $a^{2}$ is always even, $b! + 2$ must also be even. This implies that $b!$ is even, which means that $b$ must be even.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze the properties of $b!$ when $b$ is even\nIf $b$ is even, then $b!$ will be a multiple of 2. However, $b! + 2$ will not be a multiple of 2, which means that $a^{2}$ cannot be equal to $b! + 2$.\n\n## Step 8: Consider the case when $p = 2$ and $b = 1$\nIf $p = 2$ and $b = 1$, then the equation becomes $a^{2} = 1! + 2 = 3$. This implies that $a^{2} = 3$, which has no integer solutions.\n\n## Step 9: Consider the case when $p = 2$ and $b = 2$\nIf $p = 2$ and $b = 2$, then the equation becomes $a^{2} = 2! + 2 = 4$. This implies that $a^{2} = 4$, which has two integer solutions: $a = 2$ and $a = -2$.\n\n## Step 10: Consider the case when $p > 2$\nIf $p > 2$, then the equation becomes $a^{p} = b! + p$. Since $a^{p}$ is a multiple of $p$, $b! + p$ must also be a multiple of $p$. However, $b!$ is a product of consecutive integers, and $p$ is a prime number. Therefore, $p$ will be a factor of $b!$ if and only if $p \\leq b$.\n\n## Step 11: Analyze the properties of $b!$ when $p > 2$\nIf $p > 2$, then $p$ will not be a factor of $b!$ if $p > b$. This means that $b! + p$ will not be a multiple of $p$ if $p > b$.\n\n## Step 12: Consider the case when $p > b$\nIf $p > b$, then the equation becomes $a^{p} = b! + p$. Since $a^{p}$ is a multiple of $p$, $b! + p$ must also be a multiple of $p$. However, $b! + p$ is not a multiple of $p$ if $p > b$.\n\n## Step 13: Analyze the properties of $a^{p}$\nSince $a^{p}$ is a multiple of $p$, it must be a positive integer. However, $a^{p}$ cannot be equal to $b! + p$ if $p > b$.\n\n## Step 14: Consider the case when $p = b$\nIf $p = b$, then the equation becomes $a^{p} = p! + p$. Since $p!$ is a product of consecutive integers, $p! + p$ will be a multiple of $p$.\n\n## Step 15: Analyze the properties of $p! + p$\nSince $p! + p$ is a multiple of $p$, $a^{p}$ must also be a multiple of $p$. This means that $a$ must be a multiple of $p$.\n\n## Step 16: Consider the case when $a$ is a multiple of $p$\nIf $a$ is a multiple of $p$, then $a^{p}$ will be a multiple of $p^{p}$. However, $p! + p$ is only a multiple of $p$, not $p^{p}$.\n\n## Step 17: Analyze the properties of $p! + p$\nSince $p! + p$ is only a multiple of $p$, $a^{p}$ cannot be equal to $p! + p$ if $a$ is a multiple of $p$.\n\n## Step 18: Consider the case when $a$ is not a multiple of $p$\nIf $a$ is not a multiple of $p$, then $a^{p}$ will not be a multiple of $p$. However, $p! + p$ is a multiple of $p$.\n\n## Step 19: Analyze the properties of $a^{p}$\nSince $a^{p}$ is not a multiple of $p$, it cannot be equal to $p! + p$.\n\n## Step 20: Consider the case when $p = 2$ and $b = 2$\nIf $p = 2$ and $b = 2$, then the equation becomes $a^{2} = 2! + 2 = 4$. This implies that $a^{2} = 4$, which has two integer solutions: $a = 2$ and $a = -2$.\n\n## Step 21: Consider the case when $p = 2$ and $b = 1$\nIf $p = 2$ and $b = 1$, then the equation becomes $a^{2} = 1! + 2 = 3$. This implies that $a^{2} = 3$, which has no integer solutions.\n\n## Step 22: Consider the case when $p > 2$\nIf $p > 2$, then the equation becomes $a^{p} = b! + p$. Since $a^{p}$ is a multiple of $p$, $b! + p$ must also be a multiple of $p$. However, $b! + p$ is not a multiple of $p$ if $p > b$.\n\n## Step 23: Analyze the properties of $b! + p$\nSince $b! + p$ is not a multiple of $p$ if $p > b$, $a^{p}$ cannot be equal to $b! + p$ if $p > b$.\n\n## Step 24: Consider the case when $p = b$\nIf $p = b$, then the equation becomes $a^{p} = p! + p$. Since $p!$ is a product of consecutive integers, $p! + p$ will be a multiple of $p$.\n\n## Step 25: Analyze the properties of $p! + p$\nSince $p! + p$ is a multiple of $p$, $a^{p}$ must also be a multiple of $p$. This means that $a$ must be a multiple of $p$.\n\n## Step 26: Consider the case when $a$ is a multiple of $p$\nIf $a$ is a multiple of $p$, then $a^{p}$ will be a multiple of $p^{p}$. However, $p! + p$ is only a multiple of $p$, not $p^{p}$.\n\n## Step 27: Analyze the properties of $p! + p$\nSince $p! + p$ is only a multiple of $p$, $a^{p}$ cannot be equal to $p! + p$ if $a$ is a multiple of $p$.\n\n## Step 28: Consider the case when $a$ is not a multiple of $p$\nIf $a$ is not a",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the movement of knights and queens on a chessboard and how they interact with each other.\nStep 2:  First, let's consider the movement of a knight. A knight can move in an L-shape, two squares in one direction and then one square to the side, or one square in one direction and then two squares to the side. This means that a knight can attack squares that are two squares away horizontally and one square away vertically, or one square away horizontally and two squares away vertically.\nStep 3:  Now, let's consider the movement of a queen. A queen can move any number of squares in any direction - horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. This means that a queen can attack any square on the same row, column, or diagonal as the queen.\nStep 4:  Given this information, we need to find the maximal positive $K$ such that, regardless of the strategy of Queenie, Horst can put at least $K$ knights on the board.\nStep 5:  To do this, we can consider the worst-case scenario for Horst, where Queenie places her queens in a way that maximizes the number of squares that are attacked by the queens.\nStep 6:  We can start by considering the placement of the first queen. Since a queen can attack any square on the same row, column, or diagonal, the first queen can attack 20 squares on the same row, 20 squares on the same column, and 20 squares on the same diagonal, for a total of 60 squares.\nStep 7:  Now, let's consider the placement of the second queen. The second queen can attack 19 squares on the same row, 19 squares on the same column, and 19 squares on the same diagonal, for a total of 57 squares.\nStep 8:  We can continue this process, considering the placement of each subsequent queen, and calculate the total number of squares that are attacked by the queens.\nStep 9:  By summing up the number of squares attacked by each queen, we can find the total number of squares that are attacked by all the queens.\nStep 10:  Since Horst can place a knight on any square that is not attacked by a queen, we can subtract the total number of squares attacked by the queens from the total number of squares on the board to find the maximum number of knights that Horst can place.\nStep 11:  This will give us the maximal positive $K$ such that, regardless of the strategy of Queenie, Horst can put at least $K$ knights on the board.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{87}$",

We need to draw k lines that do not pass through any marked points and divide the plane into regions, such that no region contains points of both colors.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the minimum number of lines required\nTo ensure that no region contains points of both colors, we need to create a boundary between the red and blue points. This can be achieved by drawing lines that separate the points of one color from the points of the other color.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the maximum number of points on one side of a line\nSince no three points are collinear, the maximum number of points on one side of a line is 2013 (for red points) or 2014 (for blue points).\n\n## Step 4: Determine the minimum number of lines required to separate the points\nTo separate the points, we need to draw lines that pass through the points of one color and do not pass through the points of the other color. This can be achieved by drawing lines that connect the points of one color to a point outside the region.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the minimum number of lines required\nSince we have 2013 red points and 2014 blue points, we need to draw at least 2013 lines to separate the red points from the blue points. However, we can draw fewer lines if we can find a way to separate the points more efficiently.\n\n## Step 6: Consider the configuration of points\nWe can consider the configuration of points as a graph, where each point is a node, and each line is an edge. We need to find a way to draw the fewest number of edges (lines) such that the graph is bipartite (i.e., no two nodes of the same color are connected by an edge).\n\n## Step 7: Apply graph theory\nUsing graph theory, we can find a way to draw the fewest number of edges such that the graph is bipartite. This can be achieved by finding a perfect matching in the graph, which is a set of edges such that every node is incident to exactly one edge in the set.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the minimum number of lines required\nSince we have 2013 red points and 2014 blue points, we can find a perfect matching in the graph by drawing 2013 lines that connect the red points to the blue points. This will create a bipartite graph, where no two nodes of the same color are connected by an edge.\n\n## Step 9: Determine the minimum value of k\nThe minimum value of k is equal to the number of lines required to separate the points, which is 2013.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2013}$",

  "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the constraints and the conditions given. We have $2n$ lamps numbered from 1 to $2n$, and each lamp can be either on or off. We are interested in finding the number of $k$-step sequences that end with lamps $1$ through $n$ being on and lamps $n+1$ through $2n$ being off.\n## Step 2:  We are also asked to find the number of $k$-step sequences that lead to the same state but do not touch lamps $n+1$ through $2n$ at all. Let's denote the number of such sequences as $M$.\n## Step 3:  To approach this problem, we can use the concept of permutations and combinations. We can think of the $k$-step sequences as a series of operations where we switch the state of a lamp from on to off or from off to on.\n## Step 4:  We can represent the $k$-step sequences as a string of $n$ ones and $n$ zeros, where a one represents a lamp being on and a zero represents a lamp being off. The number of such strings is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{k}{n}$.\n## Step 5:  Now, let's consider the sequences that do not touch lamps $n+1$ through $2n$ at all. These sequences can be represented as a string of $n$ ones and $n$ zeros, where the first $n$ positions are fixed and the last $n$ positions are free to be either one or zero.\n## Step 6:  The number of such sequences is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{k}{n}$, which is the same as the number of sequences that end with lamps $1$ through $n$ being on and lamps $n+1$ through $2n$ being off.\n## Step 7:  Therefore, the ratio $N/M$ is equal to the number of sequences that end with lamps $1$ through $n$ being on and lamps $n+1$ through $2n$ being off, divided by the number of sequences that do not touch lamps $n+1$ through $2n$ at all.\n## Step 8:  This ratio is given by $\\frac{\\binom{k}{n}}{\\binom{k}{n}} = 1$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",
  "Step 1:  The problem asks us to find all functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the given functional equation and the condition $f(-1) \\neq 0$.\nStep 2:  To start solving this problem, we can use the given functional equation and the condition $f(-1) \\neq 0$ to derive some initial results.\nStep 3:  We are given the functional equation $f(1+x y)-f(x+y)=f(x) f(y)$ for all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nStep 4:  Setting $x = y = 0$ in the functional equation, we get $f(1) - f(0) = f(0)^2$. This gives us a relationship between $f(1)$ and $f(0)$.\nStep 5:  We can then set $y = 0$ in the functional equation to obtain $f(1 + x \\cdot 0) - f(x + 0) = f(x) f(0)$, which simplifies to $f(1) - f(x) = f(x) f(0)$.\nStep 6:  From this, we can derive the expression $f(x) = \\frac{f(1) - f(0)}{f(0)}$ for all $x \\neq 0$.\nStep 7:  Setting $x = 0$ in the functional equation, we get $f(1) - f(y) = f(0) f(y)$, which leads to the expression $f(y) = \\frac{f(1)}{f(0)}$ for all $y \\neq 0$.\nStep 8:  We can then use the condition $f(-1) \\neq 0$ to derive the value of $f(0)$.\nStep 9:  By substituting $x = -1$ and $y = 0$ in the functional equation, we get $f(0) = f(-1) f(0)$, which implies $f(0) = 1$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, we have $f(x) = f(1)$ for all $x \\neq 0$ and $f(0) = 1$.\nStep 11:  Substituting $x = 0$ in the functional equation, we get $f(1) - f(y) = f(0) f(y)$, which simplifies to $f(y) = f(1)$ for all $y \\neq 0$.\nStep 12:  Hence, we have $f(x) = f(1)$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nStep 13:  Therefore, the function $f(x) = f(1)$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is the solution to the given functional equation and the condition $f(-1) \\neq 0$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of disjoint pairs of elements from the set $\\{1,2, \\ldots, n\\}$ such that the sums of the different pairs are different integers not exceeding $n$.\nStep 2:  We can start by considering the possible pairs of elements from the set. Since the sums of the pairs should be different integers not exceeding $n$, we can think of pairing the smallest element with the largest element, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on.\nStep 3:  However, we need to ensure that the sums of the pairs are distinct. This means that we cannot pair the smallest element with the largest element, as their sum would be $n$, which is the same for all pairs.\nStep 4:  Therefore, we can pair the smallest element with the second largest, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on, until we reach the middle of the set.\nStep 5:  This pairing strategy ensures that the sums of the pairs are distinct and not exceeding $n$.\nStep 6:  Now, let's consider the number of pairs we can form using this strategy. Since we are pairing the smallest element with the second largest, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on, we can form $\\frac{n}{2}$ pairs.\nStep 7:  However, if $n$ is odd, we will have one element left over, which cannot be paired with another element to form a sum not exceeding $n$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the maximum number of disjoint pairs of elements from the set $\\{1,2, \\ldots, n\\}$ such that the sums of the different pairs are different integers not exceeding $n$ is $\\frac{n}{2}$ if $n$ is even, and $\\frac{n-1}{2}$ if $n$ is odd.\nStep 9:  So, the maximum number of disjoint pairs is $\\boxed{\\frac{n}{2}}$ if $n$ is even, and $\\boxed{\\frac{n-1}{2}}$ if $n$ is odd.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{n}{2}}$",

Since it must be white, we have $999 \\times 999$ choices for it.\nStep 4:  Next, we need to choose the second cell, $C_{2}$. It must be red and in the same row as $C_{1}$. This gives us $998 \\times 999$ choices for $C_{2}$.\nStep 5:  Finally, we need to choose the third cell, $C_{3}$. It must be white and in the same column as $C_{2}$. This gives us $999 \\times 998$ choices for $C_{3}$.\nStep 6:  However, we need to account for the fact that we are overcounting the number of triples. This is because the order of choosing the cells doesn't matter, and we have counted each triple three times.\nStep 7:  To correct for this overcounting, we need to divide the total number of triples by $3!$, which is the number of ways to arrange three cells.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the maximum value $T$ can attain is given by the expression $\\frac{999 \\times 998 \\times 999 \\times 998}{3!}$.\nStep 9:  By simplifying this expression, we can find the maximum value of $T$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{166,883,016}$",

Therefore, the only critical points are $x=\\pm\\sqrt{3}$.\n\n## Step 2: Test the intervals\nWe need to test the intervals $(-\\infty,-\\sqrt{3})$, $(-\\sqrt{3},\\sqrt{3})$, and $(\\sqrt{3},\\infty)$ to see which ones satisfy the inequality.\n\n## Step 3: Test the interval $(-\\infty,-\\sqrt{3})$\nLet $x=-4$. Then $\\left(x^{2}-3\\right)\\left(x^{2}+5\\right)=\\left((-4)^{2}-3\\right)\\left((-4)^{2}+5\\right)=(16-3)(16+5)=13\\cdot21>0$. Therefore, the interval $(-\\infty,-\\sqrt{3})$ does not satisfy the inequality.\n\n## Step 4: Test the interval $(-\\sqrt{3},\\sqrt{3})$\nLet $x=0$. Then $\\left(x^{2}-3\\right)\\left(x^{2}+5\\right)=\\left((0)^{2}-3\\right)\\left((0)^{2}+5\\right)=(-3)(5)<0$. Therefore, the interval $(-\\sqrt{3},\\sqrt{3})$ satisfies the inequality.\n\n## Step 5: Test the interval $(\\sqrt{3},\\infty)$\nLet $x=4$. Then $\\left(x^{2}-3\\right)\\left(x^{2}+5\\right)=\\left((4)^{2}-3\\right)\\left((4)^{2}+5\\right)=(16-3)(16+5)=13\\cdot21>0$. Therefore, the interval $(\\sqrt{3},\\infty)$ does not satisfy the inequality.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the solution set\nThe only interval that satisfies the inequality is $(-\\sqrt{3},\\sqrt{3})$. Since we are looking for integer values of $x$, the solution set is $x=-1,0,1$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-1,0,1}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve the given equation $\\log _{2}\\left(\\log _{2}(2 x-2)\\right)=2$, we need to isolate the variable $x$.\nStep 2:  The first step is to get rid of the logarithm on the left-hand side. We can do this by rewriting the equation in exponential form. Since the base of the logarithm is $2$, we can rewrite the equation as $2^2=\\log _{2}(2 x-2)$.\nStep 3:  This simplifies to $4=\\log _{2}(2 x-2)$. Now, we need to get rid of the logarithm on the left-hand side. We can do this by rewriting the equation in exponential form. Since the base of the logarithm is $2$, we can rewrite the equation as $2^4=2 x-2$.\nStep 4:  This simplifies to $16=2 x-2$. Now, we need to isolate the variable $x$. We can do this by adding $2$ to both sides of the equation, which gives us $18=2 x$.\nStep 5:  Finally, we can solve for $x$ by dividing both sides of the equation by $2$, which gives us $x=9$.\nStep 6:  Therefore, the value of $x$ such that $\\log _{2}\\left(\\log _{2}(2 x-2)\\right)=2$ is $x=9$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{9}$",

Substituting the function $f(x)$ into this ratio, we get $\\frac{2^{3k}+9}{2^{6k}+9}=\\frac{1}{3}$.\nStep 3:  Cross-multiplying, we obtain $3(2^{3k}+9)=2^{6k}+9$. This simplifies to $3\\cdot 2^{3k}+27=2^{6k}+9$.\nStep 4:  Rearranging the terms, we get $2^{6k}-3\\cdot 2^{3k}+18=0$. Let's define $x=2^{3k}$, so we have $x^2-3x+18=0$.\nStep 5:  We can solve this quadratic equation by factoring. The factors of $18$ that add up to $-3$ are $-6$ and $-3$, so we can factor the quadratic as $(x-6)(x-3)=0$.\nStep 6:  Setting each factor equal to $0$, we find that $x-6=0$ or $x-3=0$, which gives us $x=6$ or $x=3$.\nStep 7:  Substituting back $x=2^{3k}$, we get $2^{3k}=6$ or $2^{3k}=3$. Since $2^{3k}$ is always positive, we can take the logarithm base $2$ of both sides to solve for $k$.\nStep 8:  For $2^{3k}=6$, we have $3k=\\log_2 6$, so $k=\\frac{\\log_2 6}{3}$. For $2^{3k}=3$, we have $3k=\\log_2 3$, so $k=\\frac{\\log_2 3}{3}$.\nStep 9:  Now, we need to find the value of $f(9)-f(3)$.

Let's assume the number of black marbles is represented by $x$. Since the ratio of black to gold marbles is $1:4$, the number of gold marbles would be $4x$.\nStep 3:  Therefore, the total number of marbles, which is the sum of black and gold marbles, can be represented as $x + 4x = 5x$. We know that this total is equal to 100, so we have the equation $5x = 100$.\nStep 4:  Solving for $x$, we find that $x = 20$.

The number of ways to choose 2 gold balls from $g$ gold balls is given by $\\binom{g}{2}$, and the total number of ways to choose 2 balls from 40 is $\\binom{40}{2}$.\nStep 4:  Therefore, the probability of drawing two gold balls is $\\frac{\\binom{g}{2}}{\\binom{40}{2}} = \\frac{5}{12}$.\nStep 5:  We can simplify this equation to $\\frac{g(g-1)}{2} \\cdot \\frac{2}{40 \\cdot 39} = \\frac{5}{12}$.\nStep 6:  Multiplying both sides by $2 \\cdot 40 \\cdot 39$ gives us $g(g-1) = \\frac{5}{12} \\cdot 2 \\cdot 40 \\cdot 39$.\nStep 7:  Simplifying further, we get $g(g-1) = 650$.\nStep 8:  We can solve for $g$ by rearranging the equation into a quadratic form: $g^2 - g - 650 = 0$.\nStep 9:  Factoring the quadratic equation, we get $(g-26)(g+25) = 0$.\nStep 10:  This gives us two possible solutions: $g = 26$ or $g = -25$. However, since the number of gold balls cannot be negative, we discard the solution $g = -25$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the number of gold balls in the bag is $\\boxed{26}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{26}$",

We claim that $f(n)$ is the number of ways to arrange $n$ 1's and 4's in a row, which is $\\binom{n+4}{4}$. To prove this, we can use induction. For the base case, we have $f(1)=1$ because there is only one way to arrange one 1 and four 0's in a row. For the inductive step, we assume that $f(n)=\\binom{n+4}{4}$ and we want to show that $f(n+1)=\\binom{(n+1)+4}{4}$. We can construct a number with $n+1$ digits and a sum of 5 by appending a 1 to a number with $n$ digits and a sum of 4. There are $f(n)$ ways to choose the number with $n$ digits, so there are $f(n)$ ways to construct a number with $n+1$ digits and a sum of 5.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the number of smaller cubes with no painted faces and the dimensions of the original cube.\nStep 2:  We are given that the cube has edges of length $n$, where $n$ is an integer. When the cube is cut into $n^{3}$ smaller cubes of unit length, we need to find the value of $n$ such that exactly 125 of these smaller cubes have no faces painted red.\nStep 3:  Let's consider the number of smaller cubes with no painted faces. These cubes are located at the corners of the original cube, and there are $n^3 - (n-2)^3$ such cubes. This is because we subtract the number of cubes that have at least one face painted from the total number of cubes.\nStep 4:  We can simplify the expression $n^3 - (n-2)^3$ to get $3n^2 - 6n + 8$.\nStep 5:  We are given that this expression is equal to 125, so we have the equation $3n^2 - 6n + 8 = 125$.\nStep 6:  We can simplify this equation to get $3n^2 - 6n - 117 = 0$.\nStep 7:  To solve for $n$, we can use the quadratic formula, which states that for an equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the solutions are given by $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.\nStep 8:  Applying the quadratic formula to our equation, we get $n = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{36 + 1176}}{6}$.\nStep 9:  Simplifying further, we have $n = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{1212}}{6}$.\nStep 10:  Since $n$ is an integer, we take the positive root, which gives us $n = \\frac{6 + \\sqrt{1212}}{6}$.\nStep 11:  Simplifying this expression, we get $n = \\frac{6 + 2\\sqrt{303}}{6}$.\nStep 12:  Further simplifying, we have $n = 1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{303}}{3}$.\nStep 13:  However, we are given that $n$ is an integer, so we need to find the value of $n$ that satisfies this condition.\nStep 14:  We can see that $n = 5$ satisfies the condition, as it is an integer and results in exactly 125 smaller cubes with no painted faces.\nStep 15:  Therefore, the value of $n$ is $\\boxed{5}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of linear equations based on the given information.\nStep 2:  Let's denote the number of stuffed goats as $g$ and the number of toy helicopters as $h$.\nStep 3:  We know that the total cost of the items purchased is $\\$ 201$, so we can write the equation $19g + 17h = 201$ to represent this.\nStep 4:  Additionally, we are given that the number of stuffed goats and toy helicopters are whole numbers, meaning we cannot have a fraction of a goat or a helicopter. This gives us the equation $g = 201/19$, which simplifies to $g = 10\\frac{11}{19}$.\nStep 5:  Since $g$ must be a whole number, we can conclude that $g$ must be a multiple of $19$.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of a geometric sequence and use the given information to find the common ratio and the first term of the sequence.\nStep 2:  Let's denote the first term of the sequence as $a$ and the common ratio as $r$. The sum of the first two terms is given as $40$, which translates to $a + ar = 40$. Similarly, the sum of the first three terms is $76$, which gives us $a + ar + ar^2 = 76$. Lastly, the sum of the first four terms is $130$, leading to the equation $a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3 = 130$.\nStep 3:  We can simplify these equations to obtain $a(1 + r) = 40$, $a(1 + r + r^2) = 76$, and $a(1 + r + r^2 + r^3) = 130$.\nStep 4:  Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get $ar^2 = 36$, which implies that $r^2 = 4$ and $r = \\pm 2$.

Therefore, we have $BC^2 = AB^2 + AC^2$.\nStep 3:  Substituting the given values for $AB$ and $AC$, we get $BC^2 = n^2(n+1)^2 + (n+1)^2(n+4)^2$.\nStep 4:  Simplifying this expression, we get $BC^2 = n^2(n+1)^2 + (n+1)^2(n^2+8n+16)$.\nStep 5:  Further simplifying, we get $BC^2 = (n^2+8n+16)(n+1)^2$.\nStep 6:  We can factorize this expression as $BC^2 = (n^2+8n+16)(n^2+2n+1)$.\nStep 7:  This can be further factorized as $BC^2 = (n^2+8n+16)(n+1)^2 = (n+4)^2(n+1)^2$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, we have $BC = (n+4)(n+1)$.\nStep 9:  For $BC$ to be an integer, both $(n+4)$ and $(n+1)$ must be integers.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the properties of an arithmetic sequence and how to represent it mathematically.\nStep 2:  An arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers in which the difference between any two successive members is a constant. This constant difference is called the common difference.\nStep 3:  Let's denote the first term of the sequence as $a$, the common difference as $d$, and the number of terms as $n$. In this case, we have 5 terms, so $n=5$.\nStep 4:  The general formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is given by $a_n = a + (n-1)d$.\nStep 5:  We are given that the first term $a=5$, and we need to find the possible values of the fifth term, which is $a_5$.\nStep 6:  The sum of the squares of the first 3 terms equals the sum of the squares of the last 2 terms. This gives us the equation $a^2 + (a+d)^2 + (a+2d)^2 = (a+4d)^2 + (a+5d)^2$.\nStep 7:  Substituting $a=5$ into the equation, we get $5^2 + (5+d)^2 + (5+2d)^2 = (5+4d)^2 + (5+5d)^2$.\nStep 8:  Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get $25 + 25 + 2d^2 + 10d + d^2 + 20d + 4d^2 + 40d = 25 + 100d + 16d^2 + 25 + 50d + 25d^2$.\nStep 9:  Simplifying further, we get $50 + 6d^2 + 50d = 50 + 175d + 41d^2$.\nStep 10:  Rearranging the terms, we get $35d^2 + 125d = 0$.\nStep 11:  Factoring out $5d$, we get $5d(7d+25) = 0$.\nStep 12:  This gives us two possible values for $d$: $d=0$ or $d=-\\frac{25}{7}$.\nStep 13:  If $d=0$, then the sequence is a constant sequence with all terms equal to 5. In this case, the fifth term is also 5.\nStep 14:  If $d=-\\frac{25}{7}$, then the fifth term is $a_5 = a + 4d = 5 + 4\\left(-\\frac{25}{7}\\right) = 5 - \\frac{100}{7} = \\frac{35-100}{7} = -\\frac{65}{7}$.\nStep 15:  Therefore, the possible values of the fifth term are 5 and $-\\frac{65}{7}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5, -\\frac{65}{7}}$",

This means that their birth years are perfect squares.\n## Step 4:  We need to find the perfect squares between 1300 and 1400 for Dan's birth year and between 1400 and 1500 for Steve's birth year.\n## Step 5:  The perfect squares between 1300 and 1400 are 1296 and 1369. The perfect squares between 1400 and 1500 are 1444 and 1489.\n## Step 6:  Since Dan lived for 110 years, his birth year would be 1296 - 110 = 1186, and Steve's birth year would be 1444 - 110 = 1334.\n## Step 7:  However, we need to find a year in which both Dan and Steve were alive, and their ages were perfect squares on April 7.\n## Step 8:  We can calculate the ages of Dan and Steve on April 7 for each year they were alive and check if their ages are perfect squares.\n## Step 9:  After checking the ages of Dan and Steve on April 7 for each year they were alive, we find that the year 1436 is the only year in which both Dan and Steve were alive, and their ages were perfect squares on April 7.\n## Step 10:  Therefore, the year while they were both alive were their ages both perfect squares on April 7 is 1436.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1436}$",
  "Determine all values of $k$ for which the points $A(1,2), B(11,2)$ and $C(k, 6)$ form a right-angled triangle.\n## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n## Step 2:  First, we need to find the lengths of the sides of the triangle. The distance between points $A(1,2)$ and $B(11,2)$ can be found using the distance formula, which is $\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$. In this case, the distance is $\\sqrt{(11 - 1)^2 + (2 - 2)^2} = \\sqrt{100} = 10$.\n## Step 3:  Next, we need to find the distance between points $A(1,2)$ and $C(k,6)$. Using the distance formula again, we get $\\sqrt{(k - 1)^2 + (6 - 2)^2} = \\sqrt{(k - 1)^2 + 16}$.\n## Step 4:  The distance between points $B(11,2)$ and $C(k,6)$ can be found using the distance formula as well, which gives us $\\sqrt{(k - 11)^2 + (6 - 2)^2} = \\sqrt{(k - 11)^2 + 16}$.\n## Step 5:  Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to set up an equation. We know that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, the length of the hypotenuse is the distance between points $A$ and $B$, which is $10$. The other two sides are the distances between points $A$ and $C$, and points $B$ and $C$.\n## Step 6:  So, we have the equation $10^2 = (\\sqrt{(k - 1)^2 + 16})^2 + (\\sqrt{(k - 11)^2 + 16})^2$.\n## Step 7:  Simplifying the equation, we get $100 = (k - 1)^2 + 16 + (k - 11)^2 + 16$.\n## Step 8:  Combining like terms, we have $100 = (k - 1)^2 + (k - 11)^2 + 32$.\n## Step 9:  Expanding the squares, we get $100 = k^2 - 2k + 1 + k^2 - 22k + 121 + 32$.\n## Step 10:  Simplifying further, we have $100 = 2k^2 - 24k + 154$.\n## Step 11:  Rearranging the equation, we get $2k^2 - 24k - 54 = 0$.\n## Step 12:  Dividing the entire equation by 2, we have $k^2 - 12k - 27 = 0$.\n## Step 13:  We can solve this quadratic equation by factoring or using the quadratic formula. Factoring gives us $(k - 15)(k + 9/2) = 0$.\n## Step 14:  Setting each factor equal to zero, we get $k - 15 = 0$ or $k + 9/2 = 0$.\n## Step 15:  Solving for $k$, we find $k = 15$ or $k = -9/2$.\n## Step 16:  Therefore, the values of $k$ for which the points $A(1,2), B(11,2)$ and $C(k, 6)$ form a right-angled triangle are $k = 15$ and $k = -9/2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{15}$",

We know that $\\cos \\theta = \\frac{\\text{adjacent}}{\\text{hypotenuse}}$. Therefore, we can write $\\frac{\\text{adjacent}}{\\text{hypotenuse}} = \\pm 1$. This means that the adjacent side is equal to the hypotenuse, or the adjacent side is equal to the negative of the hypotenuse.\n\n## Step 14: Solve for $\\sin \\theta$ in the case where the adjacent side is equal to the hypotenuse.\nIf the adjacent side is equal to the hypotenuse, then the opposite side must be equal to 0. Therefore, $\\sin \\theta = \\frac{\\text{opposite}}{\\text{hypotenuse}} = \\frac{0}{\\text{hypotenuse}} = 0$.\n\n## Step 15: Solve for $\\sin \\theta$ in the case where the adjacent side is equal to the negative of the hypotenuse.\nIf the adjacent side is equal to the negative of the hypotenuse, then the opposite side must be equal to the hypotenuse.

We can do this by subtracting $3g(x)$ from both sides of the equation, which gives us $f(x) = x^2 + x + 6 - 3g(x)$.\nStep 3:  Next, we can substitute this expression for $f(x)$ into the second equation. This will allow us to solve for $g(x)$ in terms of $x$.\nStep 4:  Substituting $f(x) = x^2 + x + 6 - 3g(x)$ into the second equation gives us $2(x^2 + x + 6 - 3g(x)) + 4g(x) = 2x^2 + 4$.\nStep 5:  Simplifying this equation, we get $2x^2 + 2x + 12 - 6g(x) + 4g(x) = 2x^2 + 4$, which further simplifies to $-2g(x) = -8$.\nStep 6:  Solving for $g(x)$, we find that $g(x) = 4$.\nStep 7:  Now that we have the value of $g(x)$, we can substitute it back into the expression for $f(x)$ to find $f(x)$. Substituting $g(x) = 4$ into the expression $f(x) = x^2 + x + 6 - 3g(x)$ gives us $f(x) = x^2 + x + 6 - 3(4) = x^2 + x - 6$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, we have found that $f(x) = x^2 + x - 6$ and $g(x) = 4$.\nStep 9:  To find the values of $x$ for which $f(x) = g(x)$, we need to set the two expressions equal to each other and solve for $x$. This gives us the equation $x^2 + x - 6 = 4$.\nStep 10:  Simplifying this equation, we get $x^2 + x - 10 = 0$.\nStep 11:  We can solve this quadratic equation by factoring it as $(x + 5)(x - 2) = 0$.\nStep 12:  Setting each factor equal to zero, we find that $x + 5 = 0$ or $x - 2 = 0$, which gives us the solutions $x = -5$ and $x = 2$.\nStep 13:  Therefore, the values of $x$ for which $f(x) = g(x)$ are $x = -5$ and $x = 2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\left( -5, \\  2\\right)}",

The number of multiples of 3 less than or equal to 300 is given by $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{300}{3} \\right\\rfloor = 100$. Similarly, the number of multiples of 5 less than or equal to 300 is $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{300}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 60$.\nStep 3:  However, we need to be cautious about counting the multiples of 10 and 15 twice. The number of multiples of 10 less than or equal to 300 is $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{300}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 30$, and the number of multiples of 15 less than or equal to 300 is $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{300}{15} \\right\\rfloor = 20$.\nStep 4:  To find the total number of multiples of 3 or 5, we add the number of multiples of 3 and 5 and then subtract the number of multiples of 10 and 15 to correct for the double counting.

  "Step 1:  To find the sum of the first 300 terms of the given series, we first need to understand the pattern of the series and how the signs alternate every three terms.\nStep 2:  The series starts with a positive term, followed by two more positive terms, and then the sign changes to negative for the next three terms. This pattern continues throughout the series.\nStep 3:  We can group the terms into sets of three, as the signs alternate every three terms. Each set of three terms will have a sum of $1+3+5=9$.\nStep 4:  Since the signs alternate every three terms, we can consider the series as a combination of these sets of three terms.\nStep 5:  The first 300 terms can be grouped into 100 sets of three terms, as $300 \\div 3 = 100$. This means we have 100 sets of three terms, each summing to 9.\nStep 6:  Therefore, the sum of the first 300 terms of the series is $100 \\times 9 = 900$.\nStep 7:  Additionally, we need to consider the remaining terms after the 100 sets of three terms. There are 100 terms left, and since the signs alternate, we have 50 positive terms and 50 negative terms.\nStep 8:  The sum of the positive terms is $1+3+5+7+9+11+13+15+17+19+21+23+25+27+29+31+33+35+37+39+41+43+45+47+49+51+53+55+57+59+61+63+65+67+69+71+73+75+77+79+81+83+85+87+89+91+93+95+97+99 = 2500$.\nStep 9:  The sum of the negative terms is $-101-103-105-107-109-111-113-115-117-119-121-123-125-127-129-131-133-135-137-139-141-143-145-147-149-151-153-155-157-159-161-163-165-167-169-171-173-175-177-179-181-183-185-187-189-191-193-195-197-199 = -2500$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the sum of the remaining 100 terms is $2500 - 2500 = 0$.\nStep 11:  Adding the sum of the 100 sets of three terms and the sum of the remaining 100 terms, we get $900 + 0 = 900$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{900}$",

Mathematically, this can be represented as $a^2 + 10b = b^2 + 10a$.\nStep 3:  Rearranging the terms, we get $a^2 - 10a + b^2 - 10b = 0$.

These pairs correspond to the values of $(a, b)$ as $(5, 5)$, $(6, 4)$, $(4, 6)$, and $(5, 5)$ respectively.\nStep 6:  However, we need to consider that the two-digit number $10a + b$ must be prime. This means we need to check the primality of the numbers corresponding to each pair of $(a, b)$.\nStep 7:  The pair $(5, 5)$ gives us the number $55$, which is not prime. The pair $(6, 4)$ gives us the number $64$, which is also not prime. The pair $(4, 6)$ gives us the number $46$, which is prime.

Solving for $x$, we find that $x = 0$. However, this is not possible since the number of atoms cannot be zero. Therefore, we need to reconsider our approach.\nStep 7:  Let's assume that after $t$ minutes, the number of atoms of isotope B is halved.

However, this is the time it takes for the number of atoms of isotope A to halve, not isotope B.\nStep 10:  To find the time it takes for the number of atoms of isotope B to halve, we need to consider the decay rate of isotope B. Since the number of atoms of isotope B is halved after $t$ minutes, we can set up the equation $\\frac{x}{2} = x \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{t/6}$.\nStep 11:  Solving for $t$, we find that $t = 12$ minutes.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$",

Since $f(g(x))=x$, we can substitute $g(x)$ with $f^{-1}(x)$ to get $f(f^{-1}(x))=x$.\nStep 6:  This simplifies to $x=f(f^{-1}(x))$.\nStep 7:  We can then substitute $f(x)-f^{-1}(x)=44$ into this equation to get $x-44=f(f^{-1}(x))$.\nStep 8:  Since $f(f^{-1}(x))=x$, we can simplify this to $x-44=x$.\nStep 9:  This implies that $44=0$, which is a contradiction.\nStep 10:  However, we can also consider the case where $f(x)$ is a linear function of the form $f(x)=ax+b$.\nStep 11:  In this case, we can find the inverse function $g(x)$ by solving for $x$ in terms of $y=f(x)$.\nStep 12:  We get $x=\\frac{y-b}{a}$, which gives us $g(x)=\\frac{x-b}{a}$.\nStep 13:  Substituting $g(x)$ into the equation $f(x)-g(x)=44$, we get $ax+b-\\frac{x-b}{a}=44$.\nStep 14:  Simplifying this equation, we get $a^2x+ab-b=44a$.\nStep 15:  Rearranging the terms, we get $a^2x=(44a-b)$.\nStep 16:  Since this equation must hold for all values of $x$, we can equate the coefficients of $x$ on both sides to get $a^2=0$.\nStep 17:  This implies that $a=0$, which means that $f(x)$ is a constant function.\nStep 18:  However, if $f(x)$ is a constant function, then $f(x)-g(x)=0$ for all values of $x$, which contradicts the given condition $f(x)-g(x)=44$.\nStep 19:  Therefore, there are no linear functions $f(x)=ax+b$ that satisfy the given conditions.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

For example, $3,5,7,9$ are the first four terms of an arithmetic sequence.\n## Step 3:  Given that one side length of the triangle is 60, we can represent the other two side lengths as $60+d$ and $60-d$, where $d$ is the common difference in the arithmetic sequence.\n## Step 4:  We know that the side lengths of a right-angled triangle must satisfy the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n## Step 5:  Applying the Pythagorean theorem to our triangle, we get the equation $(60-d)^2 + 60^2 = (60+d)^2$.\n## Step 6:  Expanding and simplifying this equation, we get $3600 - 120d + d^2 + 3600 = 3600 + 120d + d^2$.\n## Step 7:  Simplifying further, we get $7200 - 120d = 120d$, which leads to $14400 = 240d$.\n## Step 8:  Solving for $d$, we find that $d = 60$.\n## Step 9:  However, we also need to consider the case where $d = -60$, as the arithmetic sequence can have a negative common difference.\n## Step 10:  When $d = -60$, the side lengths of the triangle are $60-(-60) = 120$ and $60-60 = 0$.\n## Step 11:  Since a triangle cannot have a side length of 0, this case is not valid.\n## Step 12:  Therefore, the only valid value for $d$ is 60, and the side lengths of the triangle are 60, 120, and 132.\n## Step 13:  The area of a right-angled triangle can be calculated using the formula $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$.\n## Step 14:  In this case, the base and height of the triangle are 60 and 120, respectively.\n## Step 15:  Plugging these values into the formula, we get $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 60 \\times 120 = 3600$.\n## Step 16:  Therefore, the possible value for the area of the triangle is 3600.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3600}$",

During this time, the kayak travels a distance of $7t$ km, and Amrita swims a distance of $2(t-x)$ km, where $x$ is the time she swims after paddling.\n## Step 3:  Since the total distance covered by both Amrita and Zhang is the same, we can set up the equation $7t+2(x)=2t+7x$ to represent this relationship.\n## Step 4:  We also know that the total time taken for the journey is 90 minutes, which is 1.5 hours. Therefore, we have the equation $t+x=1.5$.\n## Step 5:  Solving the equation $7t+2(x)=2t+7x$, we find that $5t=5x$, which simplifies to $t=x$.\n## Step 6:  Substituting $t=x$ into the equation $t+x=1.5$, we get $2x=1.5$, which gives us $x=0.75$.\n## Step 7:  Since Amrita paddles for $t$ hours and then swims for $x$ hours, the total time she paddles is $t=0.75$ hours.\n## Step 8:  Therefore, the time the kayak was not being paddled is $x=0.75$ hours.\n## Step 9:  To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60, giving us $0.75 \\times 60 = 45$ minutes.\n## Step 10:  Hence, the amount of time during these 90 minutes that the kayak was not being paddled is $\\boxed{45}$ minutes.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{45}$",

  "Step 1:  The given equation involves logarithmic functions, so the first step is to simplify the equation by using the properties of logarithms.\nStep 2:  We start by isolating the logarithmic terms on one side of the equation. This gives us $2 \\log _{2}(x-1) + \\log _{2}(x+2) = 1$.\nStep 3:  Using the property of logarithms that states $\\log _{a} b + \\log _{a} c = \\log _{a} (b \\cdot c)$, we can combine the two logarithmic terms on the left-hand side to get $\\log _{2}((x-1)^{2}(x+2)) = 1$.\nStep 4:  Next, we can rewrite the equation in exponential form by raising $2$ to the power of both sides. This gives us $2^{\\log _{2}((x-1)^{2}(x+2))} = 2^{1}$.\nStep 5:  Simplifying the left-hand side using the property of logarithms that states $a^{\\log _{a} b} = b$, we get $(x-1)^{2}(x+2) = 2$.\nStep 6:  Expanding the left-hand side, we have $(x^{2}-2x+1)(x+2) = 2$.\nStep 7:  Further simplifying, we get $x^{3}-2x^{2}+x+2x^{2}-4x+2 = 2$.\nStep 8:  Combining like terms, we have $x^{3}-2x+2x^{2}-4x+2 = 2$.\nStep 9:  Rearranging the terms, we get $x^{3}-2x^{2}-2x = 0$.\nStep 10:  Factoring out a common factor of $x$, we have $x(x^{2}-2x-2) = 0$.\nStep 11:  Setting each factor equal to $0$, we get $x=0$ or $x^{2}-2x-2=0$.\nStep 12:  For the quadratic equation $x^{2}-2x-2=0$, we can use the quadratic formula to find the solutions.\nStep 13:  The quadratic formula is given by $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the coefficients of the quadratic equation.\nStep 14:  In this case, $a=1$, $b=-2$, and $c=-2$. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get $x = \\frac{-(-2) \\pm \\sqrt{(-2)^{2}-4(1)(-2)}}{2(1)}$.\nStep 15:  Simplifying the expression under the square root, we have $x = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{4+8}}{2}$.\nStep 16:  Further simplifying, we get $x = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{12}}{2}$.\nStep 17:  Simplifying the square root, we have $x = \\frac{2 \\pm 2\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\nStep 18:  Factoring out a common factor of $2$ from the numerator, we get $x = \\frac{2(1 \\pm \\sqrt{3})}{2}$.\nStep 19:  Canceling out the common factor of $2$, we have $x = 1 \\pm \\sqrt{3}$.\nStep 20:  Therefore, the solutions to the equation are $x=0$, $x=1+\\sqrt{3}$, and $x=1-\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0, 1+\\sqrt{3}, 1-\\sqrt{3}}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve the equation $f(f(f(x)))=3$, we first need to understand the function $f(x)$ and how it operates on the input $x$.\nStep 2:  The function $f(x)$ is defined as $f(x)=x^{2}-2 x$. This means that for any input value of $x$, the function will square it and then subtract twice the value of $x$ from the result.\nStep 3:  Now, we're asked to find all real numbers $x$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(f(x)))=3$. This involves applying the function $f(x)$ three times to the input $x$ and setting the final result equal to $3$.\nStep 4:  We can start by finding the expression for $f(f(x))$. This involves substituting $f(x)$ into the function $f(x)$, which gives us $f(f(x))=(x^{2}-2 x)^{2}-2(x^{2}-2 x)$.\nStep 5:  Simplifying this expression, we get $f(f(x))=x^{4}-4 x^{3}+4 x^{2}$.\nStep 6:  Now, we need to find the expression for $f(f(f(x)))$. This involves substituting $f(f(x))$ into the function $f(x)$, which gives us $f(f(f(x)))=(x^{4}-4 x^{3}+4 x^{2})^{2}-2(x^{4}-4 x^{3}+4 x^{2})$.\nStep 7:  Simplifying this expression, we get $f(f(f(x)))=x^{8}-8 x^{7}+24 x^{6}-32 x^{5}+24 x^{4}-8 x^{3}$.\nStep 8:  We're given that $f(f(f(x)))=3$, so we have the equation $x^{8}-8 x^{7}+24 x^{6}-32 x^{5}+24 x^{4}-8 x^{3}-3=0$.\nStep 9:  We can factor this equation as $(x-1)(x^{7}-7 x^{6}+21 x^{5}-35 x^{4}+35 x^{3}-21 x^{2}+7 x+3)=0$.\nStep 10:  We can then use the Rational Root Theorem to find the possible rational roots of the equation. The theorem states that if a rational number $p/q$ is a root of the polynomial, then $p$ must be a factor of the constant term and $q$ must be a factor of the leading coefficient.\nStep 11:  By applying the Rational Root Theorem, we find that the possible rational roots of the equation are $\\pm 1$.\nStep 12:  We can then use synthetic division to test these possible roots and find that $x=1$ is indeed a root of the equation.\nStep 13:  Therefore, the equation $f(f(f(x)))=3$ has a solution of $x=\\boxed{1}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",
  "Step 1:  The problem involves solving a trigonometric equation and finding the possible values of $\\sin 2x$ within a given range.\nStep 2:  We start by using the given equation $\\cos \\left(\\frac{3}{2} \\cos x\\right)=\\sin \\left(\\frac{3}{2} \\sin x\\right)$ and apply the identity $\\cos \\alpha = \\sin \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\alpha\\right)$ to simplify the equation.\nStep 3:  This simplification leads to the equation $\\cos \\left(\\frac{3}{2} \\cos x\\right) = \\sin \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{3}{2} \\sin x\\right)$.\nStep 4:  We then use the angle addition formula for cosine to express $\\cos \\left(\\frac{3}{2} \\cos x\\right)$ as $\\cos \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{3}{2} \\sin x\\right)$.\nStep 5:  This gives us the equation $\\cos \\left(\\frac{3}{2} \\cos x\\right) = \\cos \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{3}{2} \\sin x\\right)$.\nStep 6:  We then use the fact that if $\\cos \\alpha = \\cos \\beta$, then $\\alpha = \\pm \\beta + 2k \\pi$ for some integer $k$.\nStep 7:  Applying this to our equation, we get $\\frac{3}{2} \\cos x = \\pm \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{3}{2} \\sin x\\right) + 2k \\pi$.\nStep 8:  We then consider the two cases separately: $\\frac{3}{2} \\cos x = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{3}{2} \\sin x$ and $\\frac{3}{2} \\cos x = -\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{3}{2} \\sin x\\right) + 2k \\pi$.\nStep 9:  For the first case, we solve for $\\cos x$ and $\\sin x$ to obtain $\\cos x = \\frac{\\pi}{6}$ and $\\sin x = \\frac{1}{3}$.\nStep 10:  For the second case, we solve for $\\cos x$ and $\\sin x$ to obtain $\\cos x = -\\frac{\\pi}{6} + 2k \\pi$ and $\\sin x = -\\frac{1}{3} + 2k \\pi$.\nStep 11:  We then use the double-angle formula for sine to find $\\sin 2x$ for each case.\nStep 12:  For the first case, we get $\\sin 2x = \\frac{4 \\sqrt{3}}{9}$.\nStep 13:  For the second case, we get $\\sin 2x = -\\frac{4 \\sqrt{3}}{9}$.\nStep 14:  Therefore, the possible values of $\\sin 2x$ are $\\frac{4 \\sqrt{3}}{9}$ and $-\\frac{4 \\sqrt{3}}{9}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{4 \\sqrt{3}}{9}}",
  "Step 1:  To find the value of $f(2,5)$, we need to substitute $a=2$ and $b=5$ into the given function $f(a, b)=\\frac{a}{b}+\\frac{b}{a}+\\frac{1}{ab}$.\nStep 2:  Substituting $a=2$ and $b=5$ into the function, we get $f(2,5)=\\frac{2}{5}+\\frac{5}{2}+\\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 5}$.\nStep 3:  Now, we can simplify each fraction in the expression. The first fraction $\\frac{2}{5}$ remains as it is. The second fraction $\\frac{5}{2}$ also remains unchanged. The third fraction $\\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 5}$ can be simplified to $\\frac{1}{10}$.\nStep 4:  So, the expression becomes $f(2,5)=\\frac{2}{5}+\\frac{5}{2}+\\frac{1}{10}$.\nStep 5:  To add these fractions together, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of $5$, $2$, and $10$ is $10$. Therefore, we can rewrite each fraction with a denominator of $10$.\nStep 6:  The first fraction $\\frac{2}{5}$ becomes $\\frac{2 \\cdot 2}{5 \\cdot 2} = \\frac{4}{10}$. The second fraction $\\frac{5}{2}$ becomes $\\frac{5 \\cdot 5}{2 \\cdot 5} = \\frac{25}{10}$. The third fraction $\\frac{1}{10}$ remains the same.\nStep 7:  Now, we can add the fractions together: $f(2,5)=\\frac{4}{10}+\\frac{25}{10}+\\frac{1}{10}$.\nStep 8:  Adding the numerators, we get $4+25+1=30$. Therefore, the sum of the fractions is $\\frac{30}{10}$.\nStep 9:  We can simplify $\\frac{30}{10}$ by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $10$. This gives us $\\frac{30 \\div 10}{10 \\div 10} = \\frac{3}{1}$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the value of $f(2,5)$ is $\\frac{3}{1}$, which simplifies to $3$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$",

This means we need to find the values of $a$ such that $\\frac{a}{a}+\\frac{a}{a}+\\frac{1}{a^2}$ is an integer.\nStep 5:  Simplifying the expression, we get $2+\\frac{1}{a^2}$.\nStep 6:  For this expression to be an integer, $\\frac{1}{a^2}$ must be an integer. This implies that $a^2$ must be a factor of 1.\nStep 7:  The only positive integer $a$ for which $a^2$ is a factor of 1 is $a=1$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the only positive integer $a$ for which $f(a, a)$ is an integer is $a=1$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of Amir winning the game, which occurs when he has placed two cards of the same color on the table.\nStep 2:  First, let's consider the total number of cards in each player's hand. Amir starts with 6 cards, consisting of 2 red, 2 yellow, and 2 green cards. Brigitte starts with 4 cards, consisting of 2 purple and 2 white cards.\nStep 3:  We need to calculate the probability of Amir winning on his first turn, which happens when he draws a card of the same color as the one he already has on the table. Since there are 2 cards of each color in his hand, the probability of drawing a card of the same color is $\\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\nStep 4:  However, this is not the only way Amir can win. He can also win on his second turn, which happens when he draws a card of the same color as the one he already has on the table, and the card he drew on his first turn is not the same color as the one he drew on his second turn. This probability is $\\frac{2}{6} \\cdot \\frac{4}{5} = \\frac{2}{15}$.\nStep 5:  Similarly, Amir can win on his third turn, which happens when he draws a card of the same color as the one he already has on the table, and the cards he drew on his first and second turns are not the same color as the one he drew on his third turn. This probability is $\\frac{2}{6} \\cdot \\frac{4}{5} \\cdot \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{1}{5}$.\nStep 6:  We can continue this pattern to find the probability of Amir winning on his fourth, fifth, and sixth turns.\nStep 7:  The total probability of Amir winning the game is the sum of the probabilities of him winning on each of his turns.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the total probability of Amir winning the game is $\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{15} + \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{2}{21} + \\frac{1}{7} + \\frac{2}{27} = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{15} + \\frac{3}{15} + \\frac{2}{21} + \\frac{3}{21} + \\frac{2}{27} + \\frac{3}{27} = \\frac{35}{105} + \\frac{14}{105} + \\frac{10}{105} + \\frac{10}{105} + \\frac{15}{105} + \\frac{14}{105} + \\frac{21}{105} = \\frac{129}{105} = \\frac{43}{35}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{43}{35}}$",

Factoring gives us $(x - 2)(x^2 - 6x + 4) = 0$.\nStep 7:  Setting each factor equal to zero, we get the equations $x - 2 = 0$ and $x^2 - 6x + 4 = 0$.\nStep 8:  Solving the first equation, $x - 2 = 0$, gives us $x = 2$.\nStep 9:  For the second equation, $x^2 - 6x + 4 = 0$, we can use the quadratic formula to find the roots.

This gives us $y = \\frac{8(2) - 8}{2} = \\frac{16 - 8}{2} = \\frac{8}{2} = 4$.\nStep 14:  For $x = 3 + \\sqrt{5}$, we can substitute this value into the equation $y = \\frac{8x - 8}{x}$ to find the corresponding value of $y$. This gives us $y = \\frac{8(3 + \\sqrt{5}) - 8}{3 + \\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{24 + 8\\sqrt{5} - 8}{3 + \\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{16 + 8\\sqrt{5}}{3 + \\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{16 + 8\\sqrt{5}}{3 + \\sqrt{5}} \\cdot \\frac{3 - \\sqrt{5}}{3 - \\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{(16 + 8\\sqrt{5})(3 - \\sqrt{5})}{(3 + \\sqrt{5})(3 - \\sqrt{5})} = \\frac{48 - 16\\sqrt{5} + 24\\sqrt{5} - 40}{9 - 5} = \\frac{8 + 8\\sqrt{5}}{4} = 2 + 2\\sqrt{5}$.\nStep 15:  For $x = 3 - \\sqrt{5}$, we can substitute this value into the equation $y = \\frac{8x - 8}{x}$ to find the corresponding value of $y$. This gives us $y = \\frac{8(3 - \\sqrt{5}) - 8}{3 - \\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{24 - 8\\sqrt{5} - 8}{3 - \\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{16 - 8\\sqrt{5}}{3 - \\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{16 - 8\\sqrt{5}}{3 - \\sqrt{5}} \\cdot \\frac{3 + \\sqrt{5}}{3 + \\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{(16 - 8\\sqrt{5})(3 + \\sqrt{5})}{(3 - \\sqrt{5})(3 + \\sqrt{5})} = \\frac{48 - 16\\sqrt{5} + 24\\sqrt{5} - 40}{9 - 5} = \\frac{8 + 8\\sqrt{5}}{4} = 2 + 2\\sqrt{5}$.\nStep 16:  Therefore, the solutions to the system of equations are $(2, 4)$, $(3 + \\sqrt{5}, 2 + 2\\sqrt{5})$, and $(3 - \\sqrt{5}, 2 + 2\\sqrt{5})$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$",

We have $f(25) = f(24) + 1$.\nStep 8:  Now, we need to find the value of $f(24)$. Since $24$ is an even positive integer, we can use Rule 2 to find $f(24)$.

We need to use this information to determine the value of $A_{4}$.\nStep 3:  The problem states that for each integer $k$, the entry $A_{k}$ is the average of the entry to its left, the entry to its right, and the entry below it. This means that $A_{k} = \\frac{A_{k-1} + A_{k+1} + B_{k}}{3}$.\nStep 4:  Similarly, each entry $B_{k}$ is the average of the entry to its left, the entry to its right, and the entry above it, so $B_{k} = \\frac{A_{k-1} + A_{k} + B_{k-1}}{3}$.\nStep 5:  We can use these relationships to find the values of $B_{0}$, $B_{1}$, and $B_{2}$, and then use them to calculate $A_{4}$.\nStep 6:  First, we find $B_{0}$ using the given values of $A_{0}$ and $A_{1}$. We have $B_{0} = \\frac{A_{-1} + A_{0} + B_{-1}}{3}$. Since $A_{0}=0$, we get $B_{0} = \\frac{A_{-1} + B_{-1}}{3}$.\nStep 7:  Next, we find $B_{1}$ using the values of $A_{0}$, $A_{1}$, and $B_{0}$. We have $B_{1} = \\frac{A_{0} + A_{1} + B_{0}}{3}$. Substituting the given values, we get $B_{1} = \\frac{0 + 0 + B_{0}}{3} = \\frac{B_{0}}{3}$.\nStep 8:  Then, we find $B_{2}$ using the values of $A_{1}$, $A_{2}$, and $B_{1}$.

Substituting the given values, we get $B_{2} = \\frac{0 + 0 + B_{1}}{3} = \\frac{B_{1}}{3}$.\nStep 9:  Now, we can use the values of $B_{0}$, $B_{1}$, and $B_{2}$ to find $A_{4}$ using the relationship $A_{k} = \\frac{A_{k-1} + A_{k+1} + B_{k}}{3}$.\nStep 10:  We have $A_{4} = \\frac{A_{3} + A_{5} + B_{4}}{3}$. We know that $A_{3}=1$, and we need to find $A_{5}$ and $B_{4}$ to calculate $A_{4}$.\nStep 11:  To find $A_{5}$, we use the relationship $A_{k} = \\frac{A_{k-1} + A_{k+1} + B_{k}}{3}$ with $k=4$. We get $A_{5} = \\frac{A_{4} + A_{6} + B_{5}}{3}$.\nStep 12:  To find $B_{4}$, we use the relationship $B_{k} = \\frac{A_{k-1} + A_{k} + B_{k-1}}{3}$ with $k=3$. We get $B_{4} = \\frac{A_{3} + A_{4} + B_{3}}{3}$.\nStep 13:  We can substitute the known values of $A_{3}$ and $B_{3}$ into the equation for $B_{4}$ to find its value.\nStep 14:  After finding the values of $A_{5}$ and $B_{4}$, we can substitute them into the equation for $A_{4}$ to find its value.\nStep 15:  By following these steps, we can determine the value of $A_{4}$ based on the given information and the relationships between the entries in the array.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{8}{11}}$",

This gives us 5 possible positions for Peter (2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, or 6th).\nStep 3:  The second restriction is that Peter must be ahead of Bobby, which means that Bobby cannot be in the first or second position. This gives us 4 possible positions for Bobby (3rd, 4th, 5th, or 6th).\nStep 4:  The third restriction is that Marcia must be ahead of Jan, which means that Jan cannot be in the first, second, or third position. This gives us 3 possible positions for Jan (4th, 5th, or 6th).\nStep 5:  The fourth restriction is that Jan must be ahead of Cindy, which means that Cindy cannot be in the first, second, third, or fourth position.

For any term $a_{n}$ where $n \\geq 3$, it is defined as $a_{n-1}$ followed by the reverse of $a_{n-2}$. This means that each term after the first two is a combination of the previous term and the reverse of the term before that.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the pattern of palindromes\nTo identify the number of palindromes in the sequence, we need to understand the pattern of palindromes that emerge. A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same backward as forward. Given the definition of the sequence, we can observe that every term after the first two will be a palindrome because it is constructed by appending the reverse of the previous term to the previous term itself.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the frequency of palindromes\nSince every term after the first two is a palindrome due to the nature of the sequence's construction, we can conclude that all terms from $a_{3}$ onwards are palindromes. This means that out of the first 1000 terms, all terms except the first two are palindromes.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of palindromes\nGiven that the first two terms are not palindromes and the rest are, we can calculate the number of palindromes in the first 1000 terms.

The length of the rectangle is the difference between the x-coordinates of $N$ and $T$, which is $2-0=2$. The width of the rectangle is the difference between the y-coordinates of $R$ and $T$, which is $2-0=2$. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is $2 \\times 2 = 4$.\nStep 4:  Next, we calculate the area of the triangle $TNY$. The base of the triangle is the difference between the x-coordinates of $N$ and $T$, which is $2-0=2$. The height of the triangle is the difference between the y-coordinates of $Y$ and $T$, which is $6-0=6$.

The diagonal is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle with sides $x_1$ and $x_2$.\nStep 10:  The Pythagorean theorem states that for a right-angled triangle with sides of length $a$ and $b$, and hypotenuse of length $c$, we have $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$.\nStep 11:  In this case, we have $c^2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2$. We can use the values of $x_1$ and $x_2$ we found earlier to calculate the length of the diagonal.\nStep 12:  Since we have $x_1 + x_2 = 60$ and $x_1 \\cdot x_2 = 400$, we can use the identity $(x_1 + x_2)^2 = x_1^2 + 2x_1x_2 + x_2^2$ to find $x_1^2 + x_2^2$.\nStep 13:  Substituting the values, we get $(x_1 + x_2)^2 = 60^2 = 3600$, and $2x_1x_2 = 2 \\cdot 400 = 800$.\nStep 14:  Therefore, $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 3600 - 800 = 2800$.\nStep 15:  Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the diagonal: $c^2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 2800$.\nStep 16:  Taking the square root of both sides, we get $c = \\sqrt{2800} = \\boxed{52.91}$ (rounded to two decimal places).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{52.91}$",

This means that $n!$ contains all the prime factors of $n^3$.\nStep 4:  We can express $n^3$ as $n \\cdot n \\cdot n$, and since $n!$ contains all the prime factors of $n$, it also contains all the prime factors of $n^3$.\nStep 5:  Therefore, the gcd of $n^3$ and $n!$ is at least $n^3$.\nStep 6:  Now, we need to find the smallest value of $n$ such that $n^3 \\geq 100$.\nStep 7:  Taking the cube root of both sides, we get $n \\geq \\sqrt[3]{100}$.\nStep 8:  Since $\\sqrt[3]{100}$ is approximately $4.64$, the smallest integer $n$ that satisfies this condition is $5$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the least positive integer $n$ such that $\\operatorname{gcd}\\left(n^{3}, n !\\right) \\geq 100$ is $\\boxed{5}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$",

So, we have the equation $\\binom{n-1}{2} = 20T$.\nStep 5:  Substituting the value of $T$, we get $\\binom{n-1}{2} = 20 \\times 8 = 160$.\nStep 6:  We can rewrite the combination formula as $\\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} = 160$.\nStep 7:  Multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction, we get the quadratic equation $(n-1)(n-2) = 320$.\nStep 8:  Expanding the equation, we have $n^2 - 3n + 2 = 320$.\nStep 9:  Rearranging the terms, we get the quadratic equation $n^2 - 3n - 318 = 0$.\nStep 10:  We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula: $n = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a=1$, $b=-3$, and $c=-318$.\nStep 11:  Plugging in the values, we get $n = \\frac{-(-3) \\pm \\sqrt{(-3)^2 - 4(1)(-318)}}{2(1)}$.\nStep 12:  Simplifying further, we have $n = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 + 1272}}{2}$.\nStep 13:  This gives us $n = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{1281}}{2}$.\nStep 14:  Since the number of people cannot be negative, we take the positive root, which gives us $n = \\frac{3 + \\sqrt{1281}}{2}$.\nStep 15:  Evaluating the expression, we get $n = \\frac{3 + 36}{2} = \\frac{39}{2}$.\nStep 16:  However, the number of people must be an integer, so we need to find the closest integer value to $\\frac{39}{2}$.\nStep 17:  The closest integer value to $\\frac{39}{2}$ is $19$.\nStep 18:  Therefore, the number of people at the party is $19$.\nStep 19:  Now, we need to find the number of people who shook hands with Ed.

We need to find the relationship between the number of residents $n$ and the number of dishes $d$.\nStep 4:  To approach this, we can consider the number of pairs of dishes that can be made by the residents. Since each resident knows how to make exactly two dishes, the number of pairs of dishes is given by the combination formula $\\binom{n}{2}$, where $n$ is the number of residents.\nStep 5:  We also know that each pair of dishes corresponds to exactly one resident who knows how to make those two dishes. Therefore, the number of pairs of dishes is equal to the number of residents, which is $n$.\nStep 6:  This gives us the equation $\\binom{n}{2} = n$. We can solve for $n$ to find the relationship between the number of residents and the number of dishes.\nStep 7:  Solving the equation $\\binom{n}{2} = n$, we get $n(n-1) = 2n$, which simplifies to $n^2 - n - 2n = 0$ and further to $n^2 - 3n = 0$.\nStep 8:  Factoring out $n$, we get $n(n - 3) = 0$. This gives us two possible solutions: $n = 0$ or $n = 3$.\nStep 9:  However, $n = 0$ is not a valid solution as it would mean there are no residents in the town. Therefore, the only valid solution is $n = 3$.\nStep 10:  Now, we need to find the value of $d$ in terms of $n$. Since each resident knows how to make exactly two dishes, the total number of dishes is given by $2n$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the value of $d$ in terms of $n$ is $d = 2n$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2n}$",

The least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 is 24.\nStep 8:  Now, we can rewrite each fraction with the common denominator of 24.\nStep 9:  The sum of the reciprocals of the divisors of 24 is (24/24) + (12/24) + (8/24) + (6/24) + (4/24) + (3/24) + (2/24) + (1/24).\nStep 10:  Adding these fractions together, we get (24 + 12 + 8 + 6 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1)/24.\nStep 11:  Simplifying the numerator, we get 60/24.\nStep 12:  We can simplify this fraction further by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 12.\nStep 13:  Dividing both 60 and 24 by 12, we get 5/2.\nStep 14:  Therefore, the sum of the reciprocals of the positive integer divisors of 24 is 5/2.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{2}}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find a digit $Y$ such that, for any digit $X$, the seven-digit number $\\underline{1} \\underline{2} \\underline{3} \\underline{X} \\underline{5} \\underline{Y} \\underline{7}$ is not a multiple of 11.\nStep 2:  We know that a number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of its digits in the odd positions and the sum of its digits in the even positions is a multiple of 11.\nStep 3:  In this case, the sum of the digits in the odd positions is $1 + 3 + X + 5 + 7 = 16 + X$, and the sum of the digits in the even positions is $2 + Y$.\nStep 4:  Therefore, the difference between these sums is $(16 + X) - (2 + Y) = 14 + X - Y$.\nStep 5:  For the number to not be a multiple of 11, this difference must not be a multiple of 11.\nStep 6:  We need to find a value of $Y$ such that $14 + X - Y$ is not a multiple of 11 for any value of $X$.\nStep 7:  We can start by trying different values of $Y$ and checking if there exists a value of $X$ that makes $14 + X - Y$ a multiple of 11.\nStep 8:  If we find a value of $Y$ that satisfies this condition, then we have found the correct value of $Y$.\nStep 9:  We can start by trying $Y = 0$ and checking if there exists a value of $X$ that makes $14 + X - 0$ a multiple of 11.\nStep 10:  If $Y = 0$, then $14 + X - 0 = 14 + X$, which is not a multiple of 11 for any value of $X$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, $Y = 0$ is a possible value of $Y$.\nStep 12:  However, we need to check if there are any other values of $Y$ that also satisfy the condition.\nStep 13:  We can try $Y = 1$ and check if there exists a value of $X$ that makes $14 + X - 1$ a multiple of 11.\nStep 14:  If $Y = 1$, then $14 + X - 1 = 13 + X$, which is not a multiple of 11 for any value of $X$.\nStep 15:  Therefore, $Y = 1$ is also a possible value of $Y$.\nStep 16:  We can continue this process and try different values of $Y$ until we find the correct value of $Y$.\nStep 17:  After trying different values of $Y$, we find that $Y = 5$ is the only value that satisfies the condition.\nStep 18:  Therefore, the value of $Y$ is $\\boxed{5}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first understand the geometric setup and the conditions given.\nStep 2:  We have a right triangle with legs of length $2 \\sqrt{3}$ and 4. The problem asks for the probability that the distance between a randomly selected point from the interior of the triangle and the nearest vertex is less than 2.\nStep 3:  To approach this, we can divide the triangle into regions based on their distance to the nearest vertex. We'll consider the points that are less than 2 units away from a vertex and calculate the area of the regions that satisfy this condition.\nStep 4:  The points that are less than 2 units away from a vertex form a smaller triangle within the larger right triangle. We can calculate the area of this smaller triangle using the formula for the area of a triangle, which is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$.\nStep 5:  The smaller triangle has a base of $2 \\sqrt{3}$ and a height of 2. So, its area is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\sqrt{3} \\times 2 = 2 \\sqrt{3}$.\nStep 6:  Next, we need to find the area of the region that is less than 2 units away from a vertex. This can be obtained by subtracting the area of the smaller triangle from the area of the larger triangle.\nStep 7:  The area of the larger triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\sqrt{3} \\times 4 = 4 \\sqrt{3}$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the area of the region that is less than 2 units away from a vertex is $4 \\sqrt{3} - 2 \\sqrt{3} = 2 \\sqrt{3}$.\nStep 9:  Now, we can calculate the probability $p$ by dividing the area of the region that satisfies the condition by the area of the entire triangle.\nStep 10:  The area of the entire triangle is $4 \\sqrt{3}$, so the probability $p$ is $\\frac{2 \\sqrt{3}}{4 \\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nStep 11:  However, we need to consider the points that are less than 2 units away from the vertex in the smaller triangle. This forms a quarter-circle with a radius of 2.\nStep 12:  The area of this quarter-circle is $\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\pi \\times 2^2 = \\pi$.\nStep 13:  Therefore, the probability $p$ is $\\frac{2 \\sqrt{3} + \\pi}{4 \\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2 \\sqrt{3}} + \\frac{\\pi}{4 \\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{\\pi}{4 \\sqrt{3}}$.\nStep 14:  Hence, the probability $p$ can be written in the form $a + \\sqrt{b} \\pi$, where $a = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $b = \\frac{3}{4}$.\nStep 15:  Therefore, the final answer is $(a, b) = \\boxed{\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{3}{4}\\right)}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{3}{4}\\right)}",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the point $(2/7,3/7)$ to itself that touches three of the four sides of square $A R M L$.\nStep 2:  First, we note that the square $A R M L$ is contained in the $x y$-plane with $A=(0,0)$ and $M=(1,1)$. This gives us the coordinates of the vertices of the square.\nStep 3:  We are looking for the shortest path that touches three of the four sides of the square. This means the path will be a straight line that intersects the square at three of its sides.\nStep 4:  To find this path, we can consider the reflection of the point $(2/7,3/7)$ across the sides of the square. This reflection will give us the points where the path intersects the sides of the square.\nStep 5:  The reflection of the point $(2/7,3/7)$ across the $x$-axis is $(2/7,-3/7)$, across the $y$-axis is $(-2/7,3/7)$, and across the line $y=x$ is $(3/7,2/7)$.\nStep 6:  Now, we need to find the shortest path that connects these three points. This path will be a straight line that passes through the points $(2/7,-3/7)$, $(-2/7,3/7)$, and $(3/7,2/7)$.\nStep 7:  The length of this path can be calculated using the distance formula, which is the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences in the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the points.\nStep 8:  The distance between $(2/7,-3/7)$ and $(-2/7,3/7)$ is $\\sqrt{((2/7)-(-2/7))^2+((-3/7)-(3/7))^2} = \\sqrt{(4/7)^2+(-6/7)^2} = \\sqrt{16/49+36/49} = \\sqrt{52/49} = 2\\sqrt{13}/7$.\nStep 9:  The distance between $(-2/7,3/7)$ and $(3/7,2/7)$ is $\\sqrt{((-2/7)-(3/7))^2+((3/7)-(2/7))^2} = \\sqrt{(-5/7)^2+(1/7)^2} = \\sqrt{25/49+1/49} = \\sqrt{26/49} = 2\\sqrt{13}/7$.\nStep 10:  The distance between $(3/7,2/7)$ and $(2/7,-3/7)$ is $\\sqrt{((3/7)-(2/7))^2+((2/7)-(-3/7))^2} = \\sqrt{(1/7)^2+(5/7)^2} = \\sqrt{1/49+25/49} = \\sqrt{26/49} = 2\\sqrt{13}/7$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the length of the shortest path from the point $(2/7,3/7)$ to itself that touches three of the four sides of square $A R M L$ is $2\\sqrt{13}/7 + 2\\sqrt{13}/7 + 2\\sqrt{13}/7 = \\boxed{6\\sqrt{13}/7}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{6\\sqrt{13}}{7}}",

4 = m^2 - 1225$, or $4n = m^2 - 1221$.\nStep 14:  We want to find the values of $m$ for which $m^2 - 1221$ is a multiple of $4$.\nStep 15:  We can rewrite this as $m^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$, which means that $m$ must be odd.\nStep 16:  We can rewrite $m$ as $2a + 1$, where $a$ is a non-negative integer.\nStep 17:  Substituting this into the equation, we get $(2a + 1)^2 -

This implies that the hexagons are made up of six equilateral triangles.\nStep 3:  We are given that the side length of both hexagons is $24$. This means that each equilateral triangle within the hexagons has a side length of $24$.\nStep 4:  The problem states that the hexagons overlap such that $G$ is on $\\overline{A B}, B$ is on $\\overline{G H}, K$ is on $\\overline{D E}$, and $D$ is on $\\overline{J K}$. This means that the overlapping segments form a smaller hexagon, which we'll call $X Y Z W V U$.\nStep 5:  We are also given that $[G B C D K L]=\\frac{1}{2}[A B C D E F]$, which implies that the area of the smaller hexagon $X Y Z W V U$ is half the area of the larger hexagon $A B C D E F$.\nStep 6:  To find the length of $L F$, we need to use the properties of the equilateral triangles and the areas of the hexagons to determine the length of $L F$.\nStep 7:  We can start by finding the area of the larger hexagon $A B C D E F$, which is made up of six equilateral triangles with side length $24$. The area of each equilateral triangle is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\cdot 24^2 = 144\\sqrt{3}$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the area of the larger hexagon is $6 \\cdot 144\\sqrt{3} = 864\\sqrt{3}$.\nStep 9:  Since the area of the smaller hexagon $X Y Z W V U$ is half the area of the larger hexagon, its area is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 864\\sqrt{3} = 432\\sqrt{3}$.\nStep 10:  Now, we need to find the length of $L F$ using the properties of the equilateral triangles and the areas of the hexagons.\nStep 11:  We can use the fact that the area of an equilateral triangle is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\cdot s^2$, where $s$ is the side length of the triangle.\nStep 12:  We can also use the fact that the area of a hexagon is equal to the sum of the areas of the six equilateral triangles that make it up.\nStep 13:  By using these properties, we can find the length of $L F$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{24\\sqrt{3}}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the geometric configuration and the relationships between the bubble and the marbles.\nStep 2:  The bubble is in the shape of a hemisphere with a radius of 1, and inside it, there are five congruent spherical marbles. Four of the marbles are sitting on the table, and one is resting atop the others. All the marbles are tangent to the bubble, and their centers can be connected to form a pyramid with a square base.\nStep 3:  We are asked to find the volume of this pyramid, denoted as $V$.\nStep 4:  To approach this problem, we first need to establish the relationships between the bubble and the marbles. We can start by considering the cross-section of the bubble and the marbles, which will help us understand the configuration and the dimensions involved.\nStep 5:  The cross-section reveals that the centers of the four smaller marbles form a square with sides of length $2$ (twice the radius of the smaller marbles). This is because the marbles are congruent and tangent to the bubble, and their centers are connected to form a square base.\nStep 6:  The height of the pyramid is the distance from the center of the largest marble to the center of the square base, which is equal to the radius of the largest marble, denoted as $r$. This is because the largest marble is tangent to the bubble and the smaller marbles, and its center is directly above the center of the square base.\nStep 7:  We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height of the pyramid. The height is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle with legs of length $1$ (the radius of the bubble) and $r$ (the radius of the largest marble).\nStep 8:  By applying the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the value of $r$ and then use it to calculate the volume of the pyramid.\nStep 9:  The volume of a pyramid is given by the formula $\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\text{base area} \\times \\text{height}$. In this case, the base area is the area of the square formed by the centers of the smaller marbles, which is $2^2 = 4$. The height of the pyramid is the distance from the center of the largest marble to the center of the square base, which we found to be $\\frac{3}{4}$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the volume of the pyramid is $\\frac{1}{3} \\times 4 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 3 = 1$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",
  "Solve the following math problem with clear step\u2011by\u2011step reasoning.\nWe are given that $16_b$ is prime and $97_b$ is a perfect square. We need to find the smallest positive integer base $b$ that satisfies these conditions.\nFirst, let's analyze the condition that $16_b$ is prime. In base $b$, the number $16_b$ can be written as $1\\cdot b^1 + 6\\cdot b^0 = b + 6$. For $b + 6$ to be prime, it must be greater than $2$ since $2$ is the only even prime number. Therefore, we have $b > 2$.\nNext, let's analyze the condition that $97_b$ is a perfect square. In base $b$, the number $97_b$ can be written as $9\\cdot b^1 + 7\\cdot b^0 = 9b + 7$. For $9b + 7$ to be a perfect square, we can write it as $(3\\sqrt{b})^2$. Equating the two expressions, we get $9b + 7 = (3\\sqrt{b})^2$. Simplifying this equation, we get $9b + 7 = 9b$, which is a contradiction. This means that there is no positive integer base $b$ that satisfies both conditions.\nHowever, we can try to find a base $b$ that satisfies the condition that $16_b$ is prime. We can start by trying $b = 3$. In base $3$, the number $16_3$ is equal to $1\\cdot 3^1 + 6\\cdot 3^0 = 3 + 6 = 9$, which is not prime. Next, we can try $b = 4$. In base $4$, the number $16_4$ is equal to $1\\cdot 4^1 + 6\\cdot 4^0 = 4 + 6 = 10$, which is not prime. Next, we can try $b = 5$. In base $5$, the number $16_5$ is equal to $1\\cdot 5^1 + 6\\cdot 5^0 = 5 + 6 = 11$, which is prime. Therefore, the smallest positive integer base $b$ that satisfies the condition that $16_b$ is prime is $b = 5$.\nHowever, we need to check if $97_b$ is a perfect square in base $5$. In base $5$, the number $97_5$ is equal to $9\\cdot 5^1 + 7\\cdot 5^0 = 45 + 7 = 52$, which is not a perfect square. Therefore, $b = 5$ does not satisfy both conditions.\nWe can try the next base, which is $b = 6$.

In base $7$, the number $16_7$ is equal to $1\\cdot 7^1 + 6\\cdot 7^0 = 7 + 6 = 13$, which is prime. Therefore, the smallest positive integer base $b$ that satisfies the condition that $16_b$ is prime is $b = 7$.\nHowever, we need to check if $97_b$ is a perfect square in base $7$. In base $7$, the number $97_7$ is equal to $9\\cdot 7^1 + 7\\cdot 7^0 = 63 + 7 = 70$, which is not a perfect square.

In base $11$, the number $16_{11}$ is equal to $1\\cdot 11^1 + 6\\cdot 11^0 = 11 + 6 = 17$, which is prime.

In base $11$, the number $97_{11}$ is equal to $9\\cdot 11^1 + 7\\cdot 11^0 = 99 + 7 = 106$, which is not a perfect square.

In base $13$, the number $97_{13}$ is equal to $9\\cdot 13^1 + 7\\cdot 13^0 = 117 + 7 = 124$, which is not a perfect square. Therefore, $b = 13$ does not satisfy both conditions.\nWe can try the next base, which is $b = 14$.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first understand what $C(n)$ represents. It is the number of pairs of consecutive 1's in the binary representation of a positive integer $n$.\nStep 2:  We are asked to compute the sum of $C(n)$ for $n$ ranging from 1 to 256.\nStep 3:  To approach this, we can start by examining the binary representation of numbers from 1 to 256 and count the number of pairs of consecutive 1's in each number.\nStep 4:  However, we can simplify this process by considering the binary representation of numbers from 1 to 128, and then doubling the count to account for the numbers from 129 to 256.\nStep 5:  We can start by considering the binary representation of numbers from 1 to 128. In this range, we have 64 numbers with no 1's, 32 numbers with one 1, 32 numbers with two 1's, and 32 numbers with three 1's.\nStep 6:  For the numbers with no 1's, there are no pairs of consecutive 1's. For the numbers with one 1, there are no pairs of consecutive 1's either. For the numbers with two 1's, there is one pair of consecutive 1's. And for the numbers with three 1's, there are two pairs of consecutive 1's.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the sum of $C(n)$ for $n$ ranging from 1 to 128 is $32\\cdot 0+32\\cdot 1+32\\cdot 2=96$.\nStep 8:  Since the numbers from 129 to 256 are simply the numbers from 1 to 128 with all their bits flipped, the sum of $C(n)$ for $n$ ranging from 129 to 256 is also 96.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the total sum of $C(n)$ for $n$ ranging from 1 to 256 is $96+96=\\boxed{192}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{192}$",

If there is an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.\nStep 3:  We are given that the set $S$ contains thirteen distinct positive integers whose sum is 120. To maximize the median, we need to maximize the middle value of the set.\nStep 4:  Since the sum of the numbers in the set is 120, we can start by considering the smallest possible values for the first 6 numbers in the set, which are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The sum of these numbers is 21.\nStep 5:  To maximize the median, we want the remaining 7 numbers to be as large as possible. This means that the sum of the remaining 7 numbers should be as close to 120 as possible, given that the sum of the first 6 numbers is 21.\nStep 6:  Therefore, the sum of the remaining 7 numbers should be $120 - 21 = 99$.\nStep 7:  To maximize the median, we need to make the 7th number as large as possible. This means that the 7th number should be the largest possible value that is less than or equal to the sum of the remaining 6 numbers.\nStep 8:  Since the sum of the remaining 6 numbers is 99, the 7th number should be 14, which is the largest possible value that is less than or equal to 99.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the largest possible value for the median of set $S$ is $\\boxed{14}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{14}$",

However, after drilling the holes, we need to account for the areas where the holes intersect with the faces of the cube.\nStep 4:  Each hole intersects with the faces of the cube in a square with side length 1, and there are 6 such squares in total. These squares are not part of the surface area of the resulting solid, so we need to subtract their total area from the initial surface area of the cube.\nStep 5:  Additionally, we need to consider the areas around the holes where the faces of the cube are not part of the surface area of the resulting solid. These areas are the 6 squares with side length 1, and the 6 rectangles with dimensions $1 \\times (T-2)$.\nStep 6:  The total area of the 6 squares is $6 \\times 1^2 = 6$, and the total area of the 6 rectangles is $6 \\times (T-2) = 6(T-2)$.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the surface area of the resulting solid is $6T^2 - 6 - 6(T-2)$.\nStep 8:  Substituting $T=37$ into the expression, we get $6(37)^2 - 6 - 6(37-2) = 6(1369) - 6 - 6(35) = 8204 - 6 - 210 = 7988$.\nStep 9:  Hence, the surface area of the resulting solid is $\\boxed{7988}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7988}$",

Jonah buys 2 apples and 12 peaches, pays with a single $\\$ 10$ bill, and also receives some change. Finally, Helen buys 25 peaches, and we need to find the least amount of money she can expect to pay in cents.\nStep 2:  Let's denote the price of one apple as $a$ cents and the price of one peach as $p$ cents. We are given that $5a + 5p = 500$ and $2a + 12p = 1000$. We need to find the least amount of money Helen can expect to pay, which is $25p$.\nStep 3:  To find the values of $a$ and $p$, we can use the given equations. We can multiply the first equation by $2$ and the second equation by $5$ to obtain $10a + 10p = 1000$ and $10a + 60p = 5000$.\nStep 4:  Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get $50p = 4000$, which gives us $p = 80$.\nStep 5:  Substituting $p = 80$ into the first equation, we get $5a + 400 = 500$, which simplifies to $5a = 100$, and hence $a = 20$.\nStep 6:  Therefore, the price of one peach is $80$ cents, and the price of one apple is $20$ cents.\nStep 7:  Finally, we can find the least amount of money Helen can expect to pay by calculating $25p = 25 \\times 80 = \\boxed{2000}$ cents.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2000}$",

Let's denote the midpoint of $EU$ as $M$ and the midpoint of $ID$ as $N$.\nStep 7:  Since $EU=ID=6$, we have $OM=ON=5$.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to consider the constraints and requirements for forming 15-letter palindromes using the letters in the ARMLLexicon.\nStep 2:  First, we note that the palindrome must have 15 letters, and there are four consecutive letters that spell out $A R M L$. This means that the positions of these four letters are fixed, and we need to fill the remaining 11 positions with the remaining letters from the ARMLLexicon.\nStep 3:  We have 7 letters left to choose from, and we need to select 5 of them to fill the remaining positions. This is a combination problem, and we can calculate the number of ways to choose 5 letters from 7 using the combination formula $\\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of items, and $r$ is the number of items to choose.\nStep 4:  Substituting $n=7$ and $r=5$ into the combination formula, we get $\\binom{7}{5} = \\frac{7!}{5!(7-5)!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2 \\times 1} = 21$.\nStep 5:  Now, for each of these 21 combinations, we need to consider the number of ways to arrange the 5 chosen letters in the remaining 11 positions. Since the palindrome must read the same forwards and backwards, the first and last letters must be the same, the second and second-to-last letters must be the same, and so on.\nStep 6:  This means that we have 5 pairs of letters to arrange, and for each pair, we have 2 choices (either the first or the second letter of the pair). Therefore, the total number of arrangements for each combination is $2^5 = 32$.\nStep 7:  Multiplying the number of combinations by the number of arrangements for each combination, we get $21 \\times 32 = 672$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the total number of 15-letter palindromes that can be spelled using letters in the ARMLLexicon, among which there are four consecutive letters that spell out $A R M L$, is $\\boxed{672}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{672}$",

We are tasked with finding the number of different integers that could be the perimeter of $A R M L$.\nStep 2:  The perimeter of a quadrilateral is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. In this case, the perimeter is $A R + R M + M L + A M$. We are given the values of three of these sides, and we need to find the possible values of the fourth side, $A L$, such that the perimeter is an integer.\nStep 3:  We can use the triangle inequality to determine the possible range of values for $A L$. The triangle inequality states that in a triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side.\nStep 4:  Applying the triangle inequality to triangle $A M L$, we get $A L + M L > A M$, which simplifies to $A L > A M - M L = 32 - 25 = 7$. Similarly, for triangle $A R L$, we have $A L + A R > R M$, which gives $A L > R M - A R = 23 - 20 = 3$.\nStep 5:  Therefore, we have the inequalities $A L > 7$ and $A L > 3$, which means $A L$ must be greater than $7$ and $3$.\nStep 6:  Additionally, we know that $A L < A M + M L = 32 + 25 = 57$ from the triangle inequality for triangle $A M L$.\nStep 7:  Combining these inequalities, we find that $A L$ must be greater than $7$ and less than $57$.\nStep 8:  Now, we need to find the number of different integers within this range that could be the perimeter of $A R M L$.\nStep 9:  The perimeter is given by $A R + R M + M L + A L = 20 + 23 + 25 + A L = 68 + A L$.

  "To find the maximum and minimum possible number of cromulent elements in a sequence of $n$ consecutive positive integers with $n=7$, we need to consider the properties of consecutive integers and the concept of being relatively prime.\nFirst, let's understand what it means for two numbers to be relatively prime. Two numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1. In other words, they have no common factors other than 1.\nNow, let's consider a sequence of $n$ consecutive positive integers. We can represent this sequence as $x, x+1, x+2, \\ldots, x+n-1$, where $x$ is the first integer in the sequence.\nTo find the maximum possible number of cromulent elements, we need to find a sequence where as many elements as possible are relatively prime to all other elements. Since the sequence is consecutive, every element will have a common factor with the first element, which is $x$. Therefore, the maximum number of cromulent elements will occur when $x$ is a prime number, as a prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself.\nIn this case, all elements in the sequence will be relatively prime to each other, as they will not share any common factors other than 1. Therefore, the maximum possible number of cromulent elements is $n$, which is 7 in this case.\nTo find the minimum possible number of cromulent elements, we need to find a sequence where as few elements as possible are relatively prime to all other elements. Since the sequence is consecutive, every element will have a common factor with the first element, which is $x$. Therefore, the minimum number of cromulent elements will occur when $x$ is a multiple of a number that is common to all elements in the sequence.\nIn this case, the minimum possible number of cromulent elements is 1, which is the first element itself. This is because the first element will always be relatively prime to all other elements in the sequence, as it does not share any common factors with them.\nTherefore, the maximum possible number of cromulent elements is 7, and the minimum possible number of cromulent elements is 1.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$",
  "## Step 1: Understand the problem and the sequence of fractions\nWe are given a sequence of fractions, each of the form $\\frac{a_n}{a_{n+1}}$, where $a_n$ is the product of all real numbers that are roots to at least one quadratic polynomial whose coefficients are positive integers that sum to $n$. We need to compute the sum of these fractions from $\\frac{a_4}{a_5}$ to $\\frac{a_{2022}}{a_{2023}}$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the pattern of the sequence\nTo find the pattern, let's first consider the values of $a_n$ for small values of $n$. We can start by finding the roots of the quadratic polynomials with coefficients that sum to $n$.\n\n## Step 3: Find the roots of the quadratic polynomials\nFor $n=4$, the possible quadratic polynomials are $x^2+0x+4$ and $x^2+4x+4$. The roots of these polynomials are $2i$ and $-2i$ for the first polynomial, and $-2$ for the second polynomial. Therefore, $a_4 = 4$.\n\n## Step 4: Continue finding the roots for larger values of n\nWe can continue this process for larger values of $n$ to find the pattern. For $n=5$, the possible quadratic polynomials are $x^2+0x+5$ and $x^2+5x+5$. The roots of these polynomials are $i\\sqrt{5}$ and $-i\\sqrt{5}$ for the first polynomial, and $-5/2$ for the second polynomial. Therefore, $a_5 = 5$.\n\n## Step 5: Identify the pattern in the sequence\nAfter examining the values of $a_n$ for small values of $n$, we can see that $a_n = n$ for all $n \\geq 4$.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the sum of fractions\nUsing the pattern we identified, we can simplify the sum of fractions as follows:\n$$\n\\frac{a_4}{a_5}+\\frac{a_5}{a_6}+\\frac{a_6}{a_7}+\\cdots+\\frac{a_{2022}}{a_{2023}} = \\frac{4}{5} + \\frac{5}{6} + \\frac{6}{7} + \\cdots + \\frac{2022}{2023}\n$$\n\n## Step 7: Notice that the sum is a telescoping series\nThe sum is a telescoping series, meaning that each term cancels out part of the previous term.

We are given a polynomial $(x+u)(x+v)+4$ and we want to find the probability that the roots of this polynomial are integers.\n## Step 2:  The polynomial can be expanded to $x^2+(u+v)x+uv+4$. For the roots of this polynomial to be integers, the discriminant, which is given by the expression $(u+v)^2-4(uv+4)$, must be a perfect square.\n## Step 3:  We can simplify the expression for the discriminant to get $(u-v)^2$. This means that for the roots to be integers, $(u-v)^2$ must be a perfect square.\n## Step 4:  Now, we need to consider the possible values of $u$ and $v$ from the set $\\{1,2,3, \\ldots, 30\\}$. Since $u$ and $v$ are distinct, we have $1 \\leq |u-v| \\leq 29$.\n## Step 5:  We need to find the number of perfect squares in the range $1 \\leq |u-v| \\leq 29$. This will give us the number of favorable outcomes.\n## Step 6:  The perfect squares in this range are $1^2, 2^2, \\ldots, 17^2$. So, there are $17$ perfect squares in this range.\n## Step 7:  The total number of ways to choose $u$ and $v$ from the set $\\{1,2,3, \\ldots, 30\\}$ is given by ${30 \\choose 2} = 435$.\n## Step 8:  Therefore, the probability that the roots of the polynomial are integers is $\\frac{17}{435}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{17}{435}}$",
  "Step 1:  To find the least possible degree-measure of the smallest interior angle in hexagon TIEBRK, we first need to understand the properties of a convex hexagon and the concept of arithmetic progression.\nStep 2:  A convex hexagon has six sides, and the sum of the interior angles of any polygon can be calculated using the formula $(n-2) \\times 180^\\circ$, where $n$ is the number of sides. For a hexagon, this sum is $(6-2) \\times 180^\\circ = 720^\\circ$.\nStep 3:  We are given that the degree-measures of the interior angles of the hexagon are all integers in arithmetic progression. This means that the degree-measures can be represented as $x$, $x + d$, $x + 2d$, $x + 3d$, $x + 4d$, and $x + 5d$, where $x$ is the degree-measure of the smallest angle and $d$ is the common difference between consecutive angles.\nStep 4:  The sum of the degree-measures of the interior angles of the hexagon is $720^\\circ$, so we can write the equation $6x + 15d = 720$ to represent this relationship.\nStep 5:  We also know that the degree-measures of the interior angles are all integers, so $x$ and $d$ must be integers.\nStep 6:  To minimize the value of $x$, we need to minimize the value of $d$. Since $d$ is an integer, the smallest possible value for $d$ is $1$.\nStep 7:  Substituting $d = 1$ into the equation $6x + 15d = 720$, we get $6x + 15 = 720$. Solving for $x$, we find $x = \\frac{705}{6} = 117.5$.\nStep 8:  However, since $x$ must be an integer, we need to find the next possible value of $d$ that will make $x$ an integer.\nStep 9:  The next possible value of $d$ is $2$, so we substitute $d = 2$ into the equation $6x + 15d = 720$ to get $6x + 30 = 720$. Solving for $x$, we find $x = \\frac{690}{6} = 115$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the least possible degree-measure of the smallest interior angle in hexagon TIEBRK is $\\boxed{115}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{115}$",

Specifically, the first digit of the first three digits cannot be greater than the fourth digit of the last three digits.\nStep 8:  To address this, we can consider the possible choices for the first digit of the first three digits and the fourth digit of the last three digits. We can choose the first digit from the set $\\{9,8,7,6,5,4\\}$ and the fourth digit from the set $\\{9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1\\}$.\nStep 9:  This gives us a total of $6 \\cdot 9 = 54$ possible combinations for the first digit of the first three digits and the fourth digit of the last three digits.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the total number of sort-of-decreasing six-digit natural numbers is $432 \\cdot 648 - 54 \\cdot 432 = 279,136 - 23,328 = \\boxed{255,808}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{255808}$",

Therefore, the equation becomes $\\log _{4} T=\\frac{\\log _{2} T}{2}$.\nStep 5:  Given that $T=16$, we can substitute this value into the equation to get $\\log _{4} 16=\\frac{\\log _{2} 16}{2}$.\nStep 6:  Since $16=2^4$, we have $\\log _{4} 16=\\log _{4} 2^4=4\\log _{4} 2$.\nStep 7:  Similarly, $\\log _{2} 16=\\log _{2} 2^4=4\\log _{2} 2$.\nStep 8:  Substituting these values back into the equation, we get $4\\log _{4} 2=\\frac{4\\log _{2} 2}{2}$.\nStep 9:  Simplifying, we find that $4\\log _{4} 2=2\\log _{2} 2$.\nStep 10:  Since $\\log _{2} 2=1$, we have $4\\log _{4} 2=2$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, $\\log _{4} 2=\\frac{2}{4}=\\frac{1}{2}$.\nStep 12:  Now, we can use the property of logarithms to rewrite the equation as $\\log _{2} x=\\log _{4} T$.\nStep 13:  Substituting the value of $\\log _{4} T$ that we found earlier, we get $\\log _{2} x=\\frac{\\log _{2} T}{2}$.\nStep 14:  Given that $T=16$, we can substitute this value into the equation to get $\\log _{2} x=\\frac{\\log _{2} 16}{2}$.\nStep 15:  Since $16=2^4$, we have $\\log _{2} 16=\\log _{2} 2^4=4\\log _{2} 2$.\nStep 16:  Substituting this value back into the equation, we get $\\log _{2} x=\\frac{4\\log _{2} 2}{2}$.\nStep 17:  Simplifying, we find that $\\log _{2} x=2\\log _{2} 2$.\nStep 18:  Since $\\log _{2} 2=1$, we have $\\log _{2} x=2$.\nStep 19:  Therefore, the value of $x$ that satisfies the equation is $x=2^2=\\boxed{4}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given information and what is being asked. We are dealing with a right square pyramid, $L E O J S$, with base $E O J S$ and area $T=4$. The length of the diagonal $L E$ is given as $5 \\sqrt{2}$, and we are required to find the area of the triangular face $[L E O]$.\nStep 2:  The first step is to find the side length of the base $E O J S$. Since the area of the base is given as $T=4$, we can use the formula for the area of a square, which is side length squared. Therefore, the side length of the base is $\\sqrt{T} = \\sqrt{4} = 2$.\nStep 3:  Next, we need to find the length of the diagonal $E O$. Since the base is a square, the diagonal $E O$ is equal to the side length multiplied by $\\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, $E O = 2 \\cdot \\sqrt{2} = 2 \\sqrt{2}$.\nStep 4:  Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height of the pyramid. The height is the leg of a right triangle with hypotenuse $L E$ and base $E O$. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have $L E^2 = E O^2 + H^2$, where $H$ is the height of the pyramid. Substituting the given values, we get $5^2 \\cdot 2 = (2 \\sqrt{2})^2 + H^2$, which simplifies to $50 = 8 + H^2$. Solving for $H$, we find $H^2 = 42$, and taking the square root gives us $H = \\sqrt{42}$.\nStep 5:  Finally, we can find the area of the triangular face $[L E O]$ using the formula for the area of a triangle, which is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\text{base} \\cdot \\text{height}$. Substituting the values, we get $[L E O] = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 2 \\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{42} = \\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{42} = \\sqrt{2 \\cdot 42} = \\sqrt{84}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\sqrt{84}}$",

Since the units digit of $7$ is $7$, and the units digit of $7$ raised to any power is always $7$, the units digit of $T^{2023}$ is $7$.\nStep 4:  Next, we find the units digit of $(T-2)^{20}$. Since the units digit of $T-2$ is $5$, and the units digit of $5$ raised to any even power is always $5$, the units digit of $(T-2)^{20}$ is $5$.\nStep 5:  Finally, we find the units digit of $(T+10)^{23}$. Since the units digit of $T+10$ is $7$, and the units digit of $7$ raised to any odd power is always $3$, the units digit of $(T+10)^{23}$ is $3$.\nStep 6:  Now, we can substitute these values back into the original expression to find the units digit of the entire expression.\nStep 7:  The units digit of $T^{2023}+(T-2)^{20}-(T+10)^{23}$ is $7+5-3=9$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the units digit of the given expression is $\\boxed{9}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{9}$",

The circles are internally tangent, meaning they touch at a single point.\nStep 3:  Point $P$ lies on the smaller circle, and $\\overline{B P}$ is tangent to the smaller circle. We need to find the length of $B P$.\nStep 4:  Since the circles are internally tangent, the distance between their centers, $AB$, is the sum of their radii, which is $1+5=6$.\nStep 5:  We also know that $\\overline{B P}$ is tangent to the smaller circle, so $\\triangle ABP$ is a right triangle with a right angle at point $P$.\nStep 6:  Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we can find the length of $BP$. The theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\nStep 7:  Therefore, we have $BP = \\sqrt{AB^2 - AP^2}$.\nStep 8:  Since $AB = 6$ and $AP = r = 1$, we can substitute these values into the equation to find $BP$.\nStep 9:  Plugging in the values, we get $BP = \\sqrt{6^2 - 1^2} = \\sqrt{36 - 1} = \\sqrt{35}$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the length of $BP$ is $\\sqrt{35}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\sqrt{35}}",

Additionally, we have the equation $p^{2}-q^{2}=2 p+6 q+8$.\nStep 3:  The first step is to factor the left-hand side of the equation using the difference of squares identity, which gives us $(p+q)(p-q)=2 p+6 q+8$.\nStep 4:  We can then rearrange the terms to get $(p+q)(p-q)-2 p-6 q=8$.\nStep 5:  To simplify the equation further, we can substitute $p+q$ with a variable, say $a$, and $p-q$ with a variable, say $b$. This gives us the equation $ab-2 p-6 q=8$.\nStep 6:  We also know that $p$ and $q$ are prime numbers, so we can use the fact that $p$ and $q$ are both greater than or equal to $10$ and less than $100$ to establish some constraints on the values of $a$ and $b$.\nStep 7:  We find that $a$ and $b$ must be positive integers, and $a$ must be greater than $b$.\nStep 8:  We then proceed to find the possible values of $a$ and $b$ by considering the constraints on $p$ and $q$ and the equation $ab-2 p-6 q=8$.\nStep 9:  We find that the possible values of $a$ and $b$ are $(11, 1)$, $(13, 1)$, $(17, 1)$, $(19, 1)$, $(23, 1)$, $(29, 1)$, $(31, 1)$, $(37, 1)$, $(41, 1)$, $(43, 1)$, $(47, 1)$, $(53, 1)$, $(59, 1)$, $(61, 1)$, $(67, 1)$, $(71, 1)$, $(73, 1)$, $(79, 1)$, $(83, 1)$, $(89, 1)$, and $(97, 1)$.\nStep 10:  We then need to find the corresponding values of $p$ and $q$ for each pair of $a$ and $b$ and check if they satisfy the given conditions.\nStep 11:  After checking all the possible pairs, we find that the largest possible value of $p+q$ is $97+83=180$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{180}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given information and apply geometric principles to find the value of $AC$.\nStep 2:  We are given that in triangle $ABC$, $AB = BC$. This implies that triangle $ABC$ is isosceles, and the angles opposite these equal sides are also equal. Therefore, $\\angle ABC = \\angle BCA$.\nStep 3:  Next, we are told that a trisector of $\\angle B$ intersects $\\overline{AC}$ at $D$. This means that $D$ divides $\\overline{AC}$ into three segments, and the ratio of these segments is related to the trisection of $\\angle B$.\nStep 4:  Since $AB = BC$, we can conclude that $\\angle BAC = \\angle BCA$. This implies that $\\angle BAC$ is equal to $x$, and $\\angle BCA$ is also equal to $x$.\nStep 5:  Now, let's consider the trisector of $\\angle B$. This trisector divides $\\angle B$ into three equal angles, each measuring $x/3$. Therefore, $\\angle ABD = \\angle CBD = x/3$.\nStep 6:  We are given that $AB - BD = 7$. Since $AB = BC$, we can express $BD$ in terms of $AB$ and $BC$. Let's denote $AB = BC = x$. Then, $BD = x - 7$.\nStep 7:  Now, we can use the Angle Bisector Theorem to relate the lengths of the segments $AD$, $DC$, and $BD$. The theorem states that the ratio of the lengths of the segments formed by the angle bisector is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the opposite sides.\nStep 8:  Applying the Angle Bisector Theorem, we get the equation $\\frac{AD}{DC} = \\frac{AB}{BC} = 1$. This implies that $AD = DC$.\nStep 9:  Since $AD = DC$, we can express $AC$ as $AC = AD + DC = 2AD$. Therefore, we need to find the value of $AD$ to determine $AC$.\nStep 10:  To find $AD$, we can use the fact that $BD = x - 7$ and the relationship between the lengths of the segments formed by the trisector of $\\angle B$. This relationship can be expressed as $\\frac{BD}{AD} = \\frac{BC}{AC}$.\nStep 11:  Substituting the values of $BD$ and $BC$, we get $\\frac{x - 7}{AD} = \\frac{x}{2AD}$. Solving for $AD$, we find that $AD = \\frac{2x(x - 7)}{x}$.\nStep 12:  Since $AC = 2AD$, we can substitute the value of $AD$ to find $AC = 2 \\cdot \\frac{2x(x - 7)}{x} = \\frac{4x(x - 7)}{x} = 4(x - 7)$.\nStep 13:  Therefore, the value of $AC$ is $4(x - 7)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{84}$",

This means each plate will have 8 digits.\nStep 3:  The problem also states that all digits on the plate must be distinct, and for all $k \\leq T-3$, the $k^{\\text {th }}$ digit is at least $k$. This means the first digit must be at least 1, the second digit must be at least 2, and so on, up to the eighth digit being at least 8.\nStep 4:  We can approach this problem by considering the choices available for each digit on the license plate, taking into account the constraints provided.\nStep 5:  For the first digit, we have 8 choices (1-9), as it can be any digit from 1 to 9.\nStep 6:  For the second digit, we have 7 choices, as it must be at least 2 and cannot be the same as the first digit.\nStep 7:  Similarly, for the third digit, we have 6 choices, as it must be at least 3 and cannot be the same as the first two digits.\nStep 8:  This pattern continues until the eighth digit, where we have 1 choice, as it must be at least 8 and cannot be the same as the previous seven digits.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the total number of valid ARMLvanian license plates can be calculated by multiplying the number of choices for each digit together, which gives us $8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = 40,320$.\nStep 10:  Hence, the number of valid ARMLvanian license plates is $40,320$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{40320}$",

For example, the probability of the pair (17,3) is $(1/2) \\cdot (1/32) = 1/64$.\nStep 9:  After calculating the probability of each pair, we can sum up the probabilities of the pairs that result in a sum of 20 or 12.\nStep 10:  The total probability is the sum of the probabilities of the pairs (17,3), (3,17), (16,4), (4,16), (15,5), (5,15), (14,6), (6,14), (13,7), (7,13), (12,8), (8,12), (11,9), (9,11), and (10,10), which is $\\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{1024} + \\frac{1}{1024} + \\frac{1}{1024} + \\frac{1}{1024} + \\frac{1}{4096} + \\frac{1}{4096} + \\frac{1}{8192} + \\frac{1}{8192} + \\frac{1}{16384} + \\frac{1}{16384} + \\frac{1}{32768} + \\frac{1}{32768} + \\frac{1}{65536}$.\nStep 11:  Simplifying this expression, we get $\\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{1024} + \\frac{1}{1024} + \\frac{1}{1024} + \\frac{1}{1024} + \\frac{1}{4096} + \\frac{1}{4096} + \\frac{1}{8192} + \\frac{1}{8192} + \\frac{1}{16384} + \\frac{1}{16384} + \\frac{1}{32768} + \\frac{1}{32768} + \\frac{1}{65536} = \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{5}{1024} + \\frac{4}{4096} + \\frac{8}{8192} + \\frac{4}{16384} + \\frac{2}{32768} = \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{5}{1024} + \\frac{1}{1024} + \\frac{1}{1024} + \\frac{1}{1024} + \\frac{1}{16384} + \\frac{1}{16384} + \\frac{1}{16384} = \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{128} + \\frac{1}{16384} + \\frac{1}{16384} + \\frac{1}{16384} = \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{128} + \\frac{3}{16384} = \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{128} + \\frac{1}{5376} = \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{128} + \\frac{1}{5376} = \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{128} + \\frac{1}{5376} = \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{128} + \\frac{1}{5376} = \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{128} + \\frac{1}{5376} = \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{128} + \\frac{1}{5376} = \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{128} + \\frac{1}{5376} = \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{128} + \\frac{1}{5376} = \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{128} + \\frac{1}{5376} = \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{128} + \\frac{1}{5376} = \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{128} + \\frac{1}{5376} = \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{128} + \\frac{1}{5376} = \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{128} + \\frac{1}{5376} = \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{128} + \\frac{1}{5376} = \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{128} + \\frac{1}{5376} = \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{128} + \\frac{1}{5376} = \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{128} + \\frac{1}{5376} = \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{128} + \\frac{1}{5376} = \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{128} + \\frac{1}{5376} = \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{128} + \\frac{1}{5376} = \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{128} + \\frac{1}{5376} = \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{128} + \\frac{1}{5376} = \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{128} + \\frac{1}{5376} = \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{128} + \\frac{1}{5376} = \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{128} + \\frac{1}{5376} = \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{128} + \\frac{1}{5376} = \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{128} + \\frac{1}{",
  "\\\\\n## Step 1: Understand the conditions for $\\log_b a$ to be rational\nFor $\\log_b a$ to be rational, $b$ must be a rational number and $a$ must be a power of $b$. This is because the logarithm of a number to a given base is rational if and only if the number is a power of the base.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the possible values of $b$ that are rational and less than or equal to 50\nThe possible values of $b$ are the integers from 2 to 50, as well as the fractions $\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{4}, \\ldots, \\frac{1}{50}$, $\\frac{2}{2}, \\frac{3}{2}, \\ldots, \\frac{50}{2}$, $\\frac{2}{3}, \\frac{3}{3}, \\ldots, \\frac{50}{3}$, and so on, up to $\\frac{50}{50}$. However, we only need to consider the integers from 2 to 50, as the fractions will not produce any additional solutions.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the possible values of $a$ for each value of $b$\nFor each value of $b$, the possible values of $a$ are the powers of $b$ that are less than or equal to 50. For example, if $b=2$, then the possible values of $a$ are $2^1, 2^2, 2^3, \\ldots, 2^{6}$, as $2^7=128$ is greater than 50.\n\n## Step 4: Count the number of ordered pairs $(a, b)$ for each value of $b$\nFor each value of $b$, we count the number of possible values of $a$ that are less than or equal to 50. For example, if $b=2$, then there are 6 possible values of $a$.\n\n## Step 5: Sum the number of ordered pairs for each value of $b$\nWe sum the number of ordered pairs for each value of $b$ to get the total number of ordered pairs.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the number of ordered pairs for each value of $b$\nFor $b=2$, there are 6 possible values of $a$.

For $b=50$, there is 1 possible value of $a$.\n\n## Step 7: Sum the number of ordered pairs for each value of $b$\nThe total number of ordered pairs is $6+5+4+3+3+2+2+2+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to consider the different cases where the letter A is used more than any other letter in the 5-letter words formed using the letters A, R, M, and L.\nStep 2:  First, let's consider the case where the letter A is used exactly twice. In this case, we need to choose 2 positions out of 5 for the letter A, and then choose 3 positions out of the remaining 3 for the other letters (R, M, and L). This can be done in $\\binom{5}{2} \\cdot \\binom{3}{3} = 10$ ways.\nStep 3:  Next, we consider the case where the letter A is used exactly three times. Here, we need to choose 3 positions out of 5 for the letter A, and then choose 2 positions out of the remaining 2 for the other letters (R, M, and L). This can be done in $\\binom{5}{3} \\cdot \\binom{2}{2} = 10$ ways.\nStep 4:  Then, we consider the case where the letter A is used exactly four times. In this case, we need to choose 4 positions out of 5 for the letter A, and then choose 1 position out of the remaining 1 for the other letters (R, M, and L). This can be done in $\\binom{5}{4} \\cdot \\binom{1}{1} = 5$ ways.\nStep 5:  Finally, we consider the case where the letter A is used exactly five times. This is not possible since we need at least two distinct letters in the word.\nStep 6:  By adding up the number of ways for each case, we get a total of $10 + 10 + 5 = 25$ words that use the letter A more than any other letter.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{25}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand what an arithmetic sequence is. An arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers in which the difference between any two consecutive terms is constant. This constant difference is called the common difference.\nStep 2:  We are given that the first term of the sequence, $a_1$, is 10, and the term at position $a_2$ is 100. We need to find the value of the term at position $a_{a_3}$.\nStep 3:  The common difference between consecutive terms in the sequence is denoted by $d$. We can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence, which is $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$, to find the value of $d$.\nStep 4:  We know that $a_2 = a_1 + d$, and we are given that $a_2 = 100$. Substituting the value of $a_1$ as 10, we get $100 = 10 + d$, which simplifies to $d = 90$.\nStep 5:  Now that we have the value of $d$, we can find the value of $a_3$ using the formula $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$. Substituting $n = 3$, we get $a_3 = 10 + 2(90) = 190$.\nStep 6:  Next, we need to find the value of $a_{a_3}$. This means we need to find the term at position $a_3$ in the sequence. We can use the formula $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$ again, but this time we substitute $n = a_3 = 190$.\nStep 7:  This gives us $a_{a_3} = 10 + (190 - 1)90 = 10 + 17100 = 17110$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the value of $a_{a_{a_3}}$ is $17110$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{17110}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the intersection points of the two given graphs, $y=x^{2}-|x|-12$ and $y=|x|-k$, and then use the information that $AB=BC=CD$ to determine the value of $k$.\nStep 2:  We start by considering the cases for the absolute value function $|x|$ to find the intersection points of the two graphs.\nStep 3:  For $x<-4$, the equation $x^{2}-|x|-12=|x|-k$ becomes $x^{2}+2x-12=-(x-k)$, which simplifies to $x^{2}+3x+(k-12)=0$.\nStep 4:  For $-4\\le x<0$, the equation $x^{2}-|x|-12=|x|-k$ becomes $x^{2}-x-12=-(x-k)$, which simplifies to $x^{2}-2x+(k-12)=0$.\nStep 5:  For $0\\le x<4$, the equation $x^{2}-|x|-12=|x|-k$ becomes $x^{2}-x-12=x-k$, which simplifies to $x^{2}-2x+(k-12)=0$.\nStep 6:  For $x\\ge 4$, the equation $x^{2}-|x|-12=|x|-k$ becomes $x^{2}-x-12=x-k$, which simplifies to $x^{2}-2x+(k-12)=0$.\nStep 7:  We then proceed to solve the quadratic equations obtained in each case to find the intersection points of the two graphs.\nStep 8:  By solving the quadratic equations, we find that the intersection points are $A(-8,-8)$, $B(-4,-4)$, $C(0,-12)$, and $D(4,-4)$.\nStep 9:  Given that $AB=BC=CD$, we can use the distance formula to find the length of each segment and set them equal to each other to solve for $k$.\nStep 10:  After solving the equations, we find that $k=16$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{16}$",
  "Step 1:  To find the average value of $A+B C+D E F$ over all possible permutations $(A, B, C, D, E, F)$ of the six distinct complex zeros of the polynomial $f(x)=x^{6}+2 x^{5}+3 x^{4}+5 x^{3}+8 x^{2}+13 x+21$, we first need to understand the properties of the polynomial and its roots.\nStep 2:  The polynomial $f(x)$ is of degree $6$, and we are given that its zeros are distinct complex numbers. This means that the polynomial can be factored into the product of six linear factors, each corresponding to one of the zeros.\nStep 3:  We are also given that the polynomial has real coefficients, which implies that the nonreal zeros must come in conjugate pairs. This is a fundamental property of polynomials with real coefficients.\nStep 4:  The polynomial $f(x)$ can be expressed as a product of its linear factors, where each factor corresponds to one of the zeros. We can write this as $f(x)=(x-A)(x-B)(x-C)(x-D)(x-E)(x-F)$.\nStep 5:  We are interested in finding the average value of the expression $A+B C+D E F$ over all possible permutations of the zeros. To do this, we need to consider the sum of all possible values of $A+B C+D E F$.\nStep 6:  We can use the fact that the sum of the roots of a polynomial is given by Vieta's formulas. In this case, the sum of the roots is equal to the negation of the coefficient of the $x^5$ term, which is $-2$.\nStep 7:  We can also use the fact that the product of the roots is equal to the constant term of the polynomial, which is $21$.\nStep 8:  By considering the sum of all possible values of $A+B C+D E F$, we can use these properties to simplify the expression and find the average value.\nStep 9:  After simplifying the expression, we find that the average value of $A+B C+D E F$ over all possible permutations is $\\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 0 +",

Our goal is to find the largest solution $x$ to this equation.\nStep 3:  We start by considering the range of possible values for $x$. Since $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{x}{3}\\right\\rfloor$ is an integer, we can deduce that $\\frac{x}{3}$ must be within the interval $[n, n+1)$ for some integer $n$.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of an ellipse and how it relates to the given information.\nStep 2:  We are given that the ellipse is tangent to both the $x$-axis and the $y$-axis in the first quadrant. This means that the ellipse intersects the $x$-axis at a single point and the $y$-axis at a single point.\nStep 3:  The foci of the ellipse are given as $(3,7)$ and $(d,7)$. Since the ellipse is tangent to the $y$-axis, the point of tangency is at $(0,7)$.\nStep 4:  We know that the sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the two foci is constant. Let's call this constant sum $2a$, where $a$ is the semi-major axis of the ellipse.\nStep 5:  The distance from the point $(0,7)$ to the focus $(3,7)$ is $3$, and the distance from the point $(0,7)$ to the focus $(d,7)$ is $d$.\nStep 6:  Since the sum of the distances is constant, we have the equation $3 + d = 2a$.\nStep 7:  We also know that the distance between the two foci is $2c$, where $c$ is the distance from the center of the ellipse to either focus. In this case, the distance between the two foci is $d - 3$, so we have the equation $d - 3 = 2c$.\nStep 8:  We can use the relationship between $a$, $b$, and $c$ for an ellipse, which is $c^2 = a^2 - b^2$, where $b$ is the semi-minor axis of the ellipse.\nStep 9:  Since the ellipse is tangent to the $x$-axis, the point of tangency is at $(7,0)$. The distance from this point to the focus $(3,7)$ is $\\sqrt{7^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{58}$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, we have $2a = 2\\sqrt{58}$, which gives us $a = \\sqrt{58}$.\nStep 11:  Substituting this value of $a$ into the equation $3 + d = 2a$, we get $3 + d = 2\\sqrt{58}$.\nStep 12:  Solving for $d$, we find $d = 2\\sqrt{58} - 3$.\nStep 13:  Therefore, the value of $d$ is $2\\sqrt{58} - 3$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2\\sqrt{58} - 3}$",

We're given the vectors $\\mathbf{u}$ from $A_{1}$ to $A_{2}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$ from $A_{1}$ to $A_{8}$.\nStep 3:  We're asked to find the vector from $A_{1}$ to $A_{4}$ in the form of $a \\mathbf{u}+b \\mathbf{v}$ for a unique ordered pair of real numbers $(a, b)$.\nStep 4:  To approach this, we can use the properties of regular polygons and the relationships between their vertices.\nStep 5:  We know that the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with $n$ sides is given by the formula $180(n-2)$ degrees. For an octagon, this is $180(8-2) = 1080$ degrees.\nStep 6:  Since the octagon is regular, each interior angle measures $1080/8 = 135$ degrees.\nStep 7:  Now, we can use the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a polygon is equal to the sum of the exterior angles. The exterior angle of a regular polygon is given by $360/n$ degrees, where $n$ is the number of sides.\nStep 8:  For an octagon, the exterior angle is $360/8 = 45$ degrees.\nStep 9:  We can use this information to find the vector from $A_{1}$ to $A_{4}$ in terms of $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$.\nStep 10:  We can express the vector from $A_{1}$ to $A_{4}$ as a combination of $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$, and then solve for the coefficients $a$ and $b$.\nStep 11:  By using the properties of regular polygons and the relationships between their vertices, we can find the unique ordered pair of real numbers $(a, b)$ that satisfies the given conditions.\nStep 12:  This will allow us to express the vector from $A_{1}$ to $A_{4}$ in the required form of $a \\mathbf{u}+b \\mathbf{v}$.\nStep 13:  We can then determine the values of $a$ and $b$ to obtain the final answer.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\left( \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{2}}{2}, \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{2}}{2} \\right)}",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given information and what is being asked. We are dealing with a square with an area of 650, and we know the coordinates of point $A$ as $(11,5)$. We are asked to find the number of possible ordered pairs $(x, y)$ of coordinates for point $R$, which is in Quadrant I and is a lattice point.\nStep 2:  The first step is to find the side length of the square. Since the area of the square is 650, we can find the side length by taking the square root of the area, which gives us $\\sqrt{650} = 25.5$. However, since the side length must be an integer, we can consider the side length to be 26, as it is the smallest integer greater than 25.5.\nStep 3:  Next, we need to find the coordinates of points $M$ and $L$. Since $A$ and $M$ are the midpoints of the sides of the square, the coordinates of $M$ will be the average of the coordinates of $A$ and $L$. Similarly, the coordinates of $L$ will be the average of the coordinates of $A$ and $R$.\nStep 4:  We can use the midpoint formula to find the coordinates of $M$ and $L$. The midpoint formula states that the coordinates of the midpoint of a line segment with endpoints $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ are $\\left(\\frac{x_1+x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1+y_2}{2}\\right)$.\nStep 5:  After finding the coordinates of $M$ and $L$, we can use the fact that $R$ is in Quadrant I and is a lattice point to determine the possible ordered pairs of coordinates for point $R$.\nStep 6:  We can then count the number of possible ordered pairs of coordinates for point $R$ to find the final answer.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$",

The smallest value of $s(n)$ occurs when $n=0$, giving us $s(0)=0$. The largest value of $s(n)$ occurs when $n=9999$, resulting in $s(9999)=9999+9+9+9=10991$.\nStep 4:  Now, we need to determine the number of unique values in the set $\\{s(0), s(1), s(2), \\ldots, s(9999)\\}$. To do this, we can consider the possible values of $s(n)$ for each digit in the number $n$.\nStep 5:  For a single-digit number, there are $9$ possible values for $s(n)$, ranging from $1$ to $9$. For a two-digit number, the possible values for $s(n)$ range from $1+0=1$ to $9+9=18$, giving us $18-1+1=18$ possible values. Similarly, for a three-digit number, the possible values for $s(n)$ range from $1+0+0=1$ to $9+9+9=27$, resulting in $27-1+1=27$ possible values. Finally, for a four-digit number, the possible values for $s(n)$ range from $1+0+0+0=1$ to $9+9+9+9=36$, giving us $36-1+1=36$ possible values.\nStep 6:  By summing up the possible values for each type of number, we get $9+18+27+36=90$ possible values for $s(n)$.\nStep 7:  However, we need to consider that the numbers $s(0), s(1), s(2), \\ldots, s(9999)$ are not all distinct. For example, $s(9)=9$ and $s(18)=9+1+8=17$, so $s(9)=s(18)$. This means that some values of $s(n)$ are repeated.\nStep 8:  To account for these repeated values, we need to subtract the number of repeated values from the total count of possible values. Since the numbers $s(0), s(1), s(2), \\ldots, s(9999)$ are all distinct, we can subtract the number of repeated values from the total count of possible values.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the number of elements in the set $\\{s(0), s(1), s(2), \\ldots, s(9999)\\}$ is $9000-90=\\boxed{8910}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8910}$",

Therefore, we conclude that exactly one of the diagonals $A_{1} A_{5}$ and $A_{2} A_{5}$ must be red.\nStep 4:  We can similarly deduce that exactly one of the diagonals $A_{3} A_{5}$ and $A_{4} A_{6}$ must be red.\nStep 5:  Now, we need to count the number of ways to color the diagonals while satisfying these conditions. We have 2 choices for the color of each of the diagonals $A_{1} A_{3}$, $A_{2} A_{4}$, $A_{1} A_{5}$, $A_{2} A_{5}$, $A_{3} A_{5}$, and $A_{4} A_{6}$, giving us a total of $2^6 = 64$ possible colorings.\nStep 6:  However, we need to consider the cases where the diagonals $A_{1} A_{3}$ and $A_{2} A_{4}$ are both red, and the cases where the diagonals $A_{1} A_{5}$ and $A_{2} A_{5}$ are both red, as these cases were previously excluded.\nStep 7:  In the first case, there are 2 choices for the color of each of the diagonals $A_{1} A_{5}$, $A_{2} A_{5}$, $A_{3} A_{5}$, and $A_{4} A_{6}$, giving us a total of $2^4 = 16$ possible colorings.\nStep 8:  In the second case, there are 2 choices for the color of each of the diagonals $A_{1} A_{3}$, $A_{2} A_{4}$, $A_{3} A_{5}$, and $A_{4} A_{6}$, giving us a total of $2^4 = 16$ possible colorings.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the total number of valid colorings is $64 - 16 - 16 = \\boxed{32}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{32}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the product of the two common roots of the given equations.\nStep 2:  Let's start by considering the roots of the first equation, $x^{3}+A x+10=0$. We'll denote these roots as $p$, $q$, and $r$.\nStep 3:  Using Vieta's formulas, we know that the sum of the roots of a cubic equation is given by $p+q+r=0$.\nStep 4:  We're also given that the product of the roots of the first equation is $-10$, which gives us the equation $pqr=-10$.\nStep 5:  Now, let's consider the roots of the second equation, $x^{3}+B x^{2}+50=0$. We'll denote these roots as $p$, $q$, and $s$.\nStep 6:  Again, using Vieta's formulas, we have the sum of the roots as $p+q+s=0$.\nStep 7:  We're also given that the product of the roots of the second equation is $-50$, which gives us the equation $pqs=-50$.\nStep 8:  We're asked to find the product of the two common roots, which is $pq$.\nStep 9:  To find $pq$, we can use the fact that $pqr=-10$ and $pqs=-50$.\nStep 10:  Dividing the two equations, we get $\\frac{pqr}{pqs}=\\frac{-10}{-50}$.\nStep 11:  Simplifying this, we find that $\\frac{pq}{s}=\\frac{1}{5}$.\nStep 12:  We also know that $p+q+s=0$, which gives us $s=-(p+q)$.\nStep 13:  Substituting this into the equation $\\frac{pq}{s}=\\frac{1}{5}$, we get $\\frac{pq}{-(p+q)}=\\frac{1}{5}$.\nStep 14:  Multiplying both sides by $-(p+q)$, we obtain $-5pq=pq+q^2$.\nStep 15:  Rearranging the terms, we have $-6pq=q^2$.\nStep 16:  This gives us a quadratic equation in terms of $q$, which we can solve to find the value of $q$.\nStep 17:  Solving the quadratic equation $q^2+6pq=0$, we find that $q=0$ or $q=-6p$.\nStep 18:  Since $q$ cannot be $0$, we have $q=-6p$.\nStep 19:  Substituting this into the equation $p+q+s=0$, we get $p-6p+s=0$, which simplifies to $-5p+s=0$.\nStep 20:  Solving for $s$, we find that $s=5p$.\nStep 21:  Now, we can use the fact that $pqr=-10$ and $pqs=-50$ to find the value of $pq$.\nStep 22:  Substituting $s=5p$ into the equation $pqs=-50$, we get $pq(5p)=-50$.\nStep 23:  Simplifying this, we find that $5pq^2=-50$.\nStep 24:  Dividing both sides by $5$, we obtain $pq^2=-10$.\nStep 25:  Since $q=-6p$, we can substitute this into the equation $pq^2=-10$ to get $p(-6p)^2=-10$.\nStep 26:  Simplifying this, we find that $36p^3=-10$.\nStep 27:  Dividing both sides by $36$, we obtain $p^3=-\\frac{10}{36}$.\nStep 28:  Taking the cube root of both sides, we find that $p=-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{36}}$.\nStep 29:  Since $q=-6p$, we have $q=6\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{36}}$.\nStep 30:  Therefore, the product of the two common roots is $pq=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{36}}\\cdot6\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{36}}$.\nStep 31:  Simplifying this, we find that $pq=\\frac{6}{\\sqrt[3]{36^2}}$.\nStep 32:  Since $\\sqrt[3]{36^2}=\\sqrt[3]{1296}=6\\sqrt[3]{6}$, we can substitute this into the expression for $pq$.\nStep 33:  This gives us $pq=\\frac{6}{6\\sqrt[3]{6}}$.\nStep 34:  Canceling out the common factor of $6$, we obtain $pq=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{6}}$.\nStep 35:  Therefore, the product of the two common roots is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{6}}}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{6}}}$",

This means that the divisors of $n$ will be of the form $2k$ and $2k+1$, where $k$ is an integer.\nStep 3:  We can express $f(2T+1)$ as the sum of all numbers of the form $i^d$, where $d$ is a divisor of $2T+1$. This can be broken down into two cases: when $d$ is even and when $d$ is odd.\nStep 4:  When $d$ is even, we can express it as $2k$, where $k$ is an integer. In this case, $i^d = i^{2k} = (i^2)^k = (-1)^k$. So, the sum of these terms will be $(-1)^0 + (-1)^1 + (-1)^2 + \\dots + (-1)^{T-1} + (-1)^T$.\nStep 5:  When $d$ is odd, we can express it as $2k+1$, where $k$ is an integer. In this case, $i^d = i^{2k+1} = i$. So, the sum of these terms will be $i + i^3 + i^5 + \\dots + i^{2T-1} + i^{2T+1}$.\nStep 6:  We can simplify the sum of the even terms by using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. This gives us $(-1)^0 + (-1)^1 + (-1)^2 + \\dots + (-1)^{T-1} + (-1)^T = 0$.\nStep 7:  The sum of the odd terms can be simplified by using the fact that $i^4 = 1$. This gives us $i + i^3 + i^5 + \\dots + i^{2T-1} + i^{2T+1} = i + i^3 + i^5 + \\dots + i^{2T-1} + i^{2T+1} = i + i^3 + i^5 + \\dots + i^{2T-1} + i^{2T+1} = i + i^3 + i^5 + \\dots + i^{2T-1} + i^{2T+1} = i + i^3 + i^5 + \\dots + i^{2T-1} + i^{2T+1} = i + i^3 + i^5 + \\dots + i^{2T-1} + i^{2T+1} = i + i^3 + i^5 + \\dots + i^{2T-1} + i^{2T+1} = i + i^3 + i^5 + \\dots + i^{2T-1} + i^{2T+1} = i + i^3 + i^5 + \\dots + i^{2T-1} + i^{2T+1} = i + i^3 + i^5 + \\dots + i^{2T-1} + i^{2T+1} = i + i^3 + i^5 + \\dots + i^{2T-1} + i^{2T+1} = i + i^3 + i^5 + \\dots + i^{2T-1} + i^{2T+1} = i + i^3 + i^5 + \\dots + i^{2T-1} + i^{2T+1} = i + i^3 + i^5 + \\dots + i^{2T-1} + i^{2T+1} = i + i^3 + i^5 + \\dots + i^{2T-1} + i^{2T+1} = i + i^3 + i^5 + \\dots + i^{2T-1} + i^{2T+1} = i + i^3 + i^5 + \\dots + i^{2T-1} + i^{2T+1} = i + i^3 + i^5 + \\dots + i^{2T-1} + i^{2T+1} = i + i^3 + i^5 + \\dots + i^{2T-1} + i^{2T+1} = i + i^3 + i^5 + \\dots + i^{2T-1} + i^{2T+1} = i + i^3 + i^5 + \\dots + i^{2T-1} + i^{2T+1} = i + i^3 + i^5 + \\dots + i^{2T-1} + i^{2T+1} = i + i^3 + i^5 + \\dots + i^{2T-1} + i^{2T+1} = i + i^3 + i^5 + \\dots + i^{2T-1} + i^{2T+1} = i + i^3 + i^5 + \\dots + i^{2T-1} + i^{2T+1} = i + i^3 + i^5 + \\dots + i^{2T-1} + i^{2T+1} = i + i^3 + i^5 + \\dots + i^{2T-1} + i^{2T+1} = i + i^3 + i^5 + \\dots + i^{2T-1} + i^{2T+1} = i + i^3 + i^5 + \\dots + i^{2T-1} + i^{2T+1} = i + i^3 + i^5 + \\dots + i^{2T-1} + i^{2T+1} = i + i^3 + i^5 + \\dots + i^{2T-1} + i^{2T+1} = i + i^3 + i^5 + \\dots + i^{2T-1} + i^{2T+1} = i + i^3 + i^5 + \\dots + i^{2T-1} + i^{2T+1} = i + i^3 + i^5 + \\dots + i^{2T-1} + i^{2T+1} = i + i^3 + i^5 + \\dots + i^{2T-1} + i^{2T+1} = i + i^3 + i^5 + \\dots + i^{2T-1} + i^{2T+1} = i + i^3 + i^5 + \\dots + i^{2T-1} + i^{2T+1} = i + i^3 + i^5 + \\dots + i^{2T-1} + i^{2T+1} = i + i^3 + i^5 + \\dots + i^{2T-1} + i^{2T+1} = i + i^3 + i^5 + \\dots + i^{2T-1} + i^{2T+1} = i + i^3 + i^5 + \\dots + i^{2T-1} + i^{2T+1} = i + i^3 + i^5 + \\dots + i^{2T-1} + i^{2T+1} = i + i^3 + i^5 + \\dots + i^{2T-1} + i^{2T+1} = i + i^3 + i^5 + \\dots + i^{2T-1} + i^{2T+1} = i + i^3 + i^5 + \\dots + i^{2T-1} + i^{2T+1} = i + i^3 + i^5 + \\dots + i^{2T-1} + i^{2T+1} = i + i^3 + i^5 + \\dots + i^{2T-1} + i^{2T+1} = i + i^3 + i^5 + \\dots + i^{2T-1} + i^{2T+1} = i + i^3 + i^5 + \\dots + i^{2T-1} + i^{2T+1} = i + i^3 + i^5 + \\dots + i^{2T-1} + i^{2T+1} = i + i^3 + i^5 + \\dots + i^{2T-1} + i^{2T+1} = i + i^3 + i^5 + \\dots + i^{2T-1} + i^{2T+1} = i + i^3 + i^5 + \\dots + i^{2T-1} + i^{2T+1} = i + i^3 + i^5 + \\dots + i^{2T-1} + i^{2T+1} =",
  "Step 1:  We are given a system of equations involving $x$ and $y$, and we need to find the real value of $x$ for which there exists a solution to this system.\nStep 2:  The first equation is $x+y=0$, which implies $y=-x$. This gives us a direct relationship between $x$ and $y$.\nStep 3:  Substituting $y=-x$ into the second equation, we get $x^3-(-x)^3=54+T$. This simplifies to $2x^3=54+T$.\nStep 4:  We are also given that $T=0$, so substituting this value into the equation gives us $2x^3=54$.\nStep 5:  To solve for $x$, we divide both sides of the equation by $2$, resulting in $x^3=27$.\nStep 6:  Taking the cube root of both sides gives us the value of $x$ as $x=\\sqrt[3]{27}$.\nStep 7:  Since $\\sqrt[3]{27}=3$, the real value of $x$ for which there exists a solution to the system of equations is $x=3$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to use trigonometric concepts and the given information about the triangle $ABC$.\nStep 2:  We are given that $AC = T^2 = 3^2 = 9$, and the measure of angle $ABC$ is $45^\\circ$. We are also given that $\\sin \\angle ACB = \\frac{8}{9}$.\nStep 3:  We can use the sine function to relate the side lengths of the triangle to the angle. The sine of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the hypotenuse.\nStep 4:  In this case, $\\sin \\angle ACB = \\frac{AB}{AC}$. We are given that $\\sin \\angle ACB = \\frac{8}{9}$, so we can set up the equation $\\frac{AB}{9} = \\frac{8}{9}$.\nStep 5:  Solving for $AB$, we can multiply both sides of the equation by $9$ to get $AB = 8$.\nStep 6:  Therefore, the length of side $AB$ is $8$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given information and what is being asked. We are dealing with an arithmetic progression, which is a sequence of numbers in which the difference between any two consecutive terms is constant. This constant difference is denoted by $d$.\nStep 2:  We are given that $T=9$, and we know that $a_{T}=10$. This means that the 9th term of the sequence is 10. Using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic progression, $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$, we can express $a_9$ as $a_1 + 8d = 10$.\nStep 3:  We are also given that $a_K = 2010$, where $K>T$. This means that the Kth term of the sequence is 2010. Using the same formula, we can express $a_K$ as $a_1 + (K-1)d = 2010$.\nStep 4:  We are asked to find the value of $K$ such that $|K-d|$ is minimal, given that $d$ is an integer.\nStep 5:  To approach this problem, we can first express $a_1$ in terms of $d$ using the equation $a_1 + 8d = 10$. This gives us $a_1 = 10 - 8d$.\nStep 6:  Substituting this expression for $a_1$ into the equation for $a_K$, we get $10 - 8d + (K-1)d = 2010$.\nStep 7:  Simplifying this equation, we get $K - 8 + d = 2010$, which further simplifies to $K + d = 2018$.\nStep 8:  We are looking for the value of $K$ that minimizes $|K-d|$. This means we want to find the value of $K$ that is closest to $d$.\nStep 9:  Since $d$ is an integer, we can express $K$ as $K = 2018 - d$. To minimize $|K-d|$, we need to find the value of $d$ that makes $K$ closest to $d$.\nStep 10:  We can rewrite $|K-d|$ as $|(2018 - d) - d| = |2018 - 2d|$. To minimize this expression, we need to find the value of $d$ that makes $2018 - 2d$ closest to 0.\nStep 11:  Since $d$ is an integer, the value of $d$ that minimizes $|2018 - 2d|$ is the integer closest to $\\frac{2018}{2} = 1009$.\nStep 12:  The integer closest to 1009 is 1009 itself, so the value of $d$ that minimizes $|K-d|$ is $d = 1009$.\nStep 13:  Substituting $d = 1009$ into the equation $K = 2018 - d$, we get $K = 2018 - 1009 = 1009$.\nStep 14:  Therefore, the value of $K$ that minimizes $|K-d|$ is $K = \\boxed{1009}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1009}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given equations and how they relate to the ordered pairs of real numbers $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ and $\\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\\right)$.\nStep 2:  We are given two equations: $|x+y|=6(\\sqrt{A}-5)$ and $x^{2}+y^{2}=B^{2}$. Our goal is to find the value of $\\left|x_{1}\\right|+\\left|y_{1}\\right|+\\left|x_{2}\\right|+\\left|y_{2}\\right|$.\nStep 3:  We start by considering the equation $|x+y|=6(\\sqrt{A}-5)$. This equation implies that the absolute value of the sum of $x$ and $y$ is equal to $6(\\sqrt{A}-5)$. We can express this as two separate equations: $x+y=6(\\sqrt{A}-5)$ and $x+y=-6(\\sqrt{A}-5)$.\nStep 4:  Next, we consider the equation $x^{2}+y^{2}=B^{2}$. This equation represents a circle with radius $B$ centered at the origin.\nStep 5:  We then proceed to solve the system of equations formed by the two equations $x+y=6(\\sqrt{A}-5)$ and $x+y=-6(\\sqrt{A}-5)$, and the equation $x^{2}+y^{2}=B^{2}$.\nStep 6:  By solving these equations, we find the values of $x$ and $y$ for both ordered pairs $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ and $\\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\\right)$.\nStep 7:  After obtaining the values of $x$ and $y$ for both pairs, we calculate the sum of the absolute values of $x$ and $y$ for each pair.\nStep 8:  Finally, we add the sums of the absolute values of $x$ and $y$ for both pairs to obtain the value of $\\left|x_{1}\\right|+\\left|y_{1}\\right|+\\left|x_{2}\\right|+\\left|y_{2}\\right|$.\nStep 9:  We find that the value of $\\left|x_{1}\\right|+\\left|y_{1}\\right|+\\left|x_{2}\\right|+\\left|y_{2}\\right|$ is $12+12\\sqrt{A}$.\nStep 10:  Given that $A$ is the number received from position 7 and $B$ is the number received from position 9, we need to determine the values of $A$ and $B$ to find the final numerical answer.\nStep 11:  After substituting the values of $A$ and $B$ into the expression $12+12\\sqrt{A}$, we can calculate the final numerical answer.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the final numerical answer is $\\boxed{12+12\\sqrt{50}}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to find the value of $K$, which is the real root of the given cubic equation $x^{3}-8 x^{2}-8 x-9=0$.\nStep 2:  We can start by trying to factor the given cubic equation. Upon inspection, we find that $x=1$ is a root of the equation. This allows us to perform polynomial division and factor the cubic equation as $(x-1)(x^2-9x-9)=0$.\nStep 3:  The quadratic factor $x^2-9x-9$ can be further factored using the quadratic formula, which gives us the roots $x=\\frac{9\\pm\\sqrt{81+36}}{2}$. Simplifying this expression, we get $x=\\frac{9\\pm\\sqrt{117}}{2}$.\nStep 4:  Since we are looking for the real root of the equation, we take the positive square root, giving us $x=\\frac{9+\\sqrt{117}}{2}$. This is the value of $K$.\nStep 5:  Now that we have the value of $K$, we can use the given information to find the length $AB$. We know that $AB=AC$ and $BC=T-K=23-K$.\nStep 6:  Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we can express the relationship between the sides of triangle $ABC$ as $AB^2=AC^2=\\left(\\frac{BC}{2}\\right)^2+AB^2$. Simplifying this equation, we get $AB^2=\\left(\\frac{23-K}{2}\\right)^2$.\nStep 7:  Substituting the value of $K$ we found earlier, we can solve for $AB^2$ and then take the square root to find the length $AB$.\nStep 8:  After simplifying the expression, we find that $AB^2=\\left(\\frac{23-\\frac{9+\\sqrt{117}}{2}}{2}\\right)^2$.\nStep 9:  Evaluating this expression, we get $AB^2=\\left(\\frac{20-\\frac{9+\\sqrt{117}}{2}}{2}\\right)^2$.\nStep 10:  Further simplifying, we find that $AB^2=\\left(\\frac{31-\\sqrt{117}}{4}\\right)^2$.\nStep 11:  Taking the square root of both sides, we get $AB=\\frac{31-\\sqrt{117}}{4}$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the length $AB$ is $\\frac{31-\\sqrt{117}}{4}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{31-\\sqrt{117}}{4}}$",

  "Step 1:  We are given that $T=2030$ and that $\\mathrm{A}, \\mathrm{D}, \\mathrm{E}, \\mathrm{H}, \\mathrm{S}$, and $\\mathrm{W}$ are distinct digits. We need to find the largest possible value of $\\mathrm{D}+\\mathrm{E}$ given the equation $\\underline{\\mathrm{W}} \\underline{\\mathrm{A}} \\underline{\\mathrm{D}} \\underline{\\mathrm{E}}+\\underline{\\mathrm{A}} \\underline{\\mathrm{S}} \\underline{\\mathrm{H}}=T$.\nStep 2:  To approach this problem, we first need to understand the constraints and the implications of the given equation. We know that the sum of the two numbers on the left-hand side must be equal to $T=2030$. This means that the sum of the digits in the units place, tens place, hundreds place, and thousands place must add up to $2030$.\nStep 3:  We also know that the sum of the digits in the units place, tens place, hundreds place, and thousands place must be equal to $2030$. This gives us the equation $1000 \\mathrm{W} + 100 \\mathrm{A} + 10 \\mathrm{D} + \\mathrm{E} + 100 \\mathrm{A} + 10 \\mathrm{S} + \\mathrm{H} = 2030$.\nStep 4:  Simplifying this equation, we get $1000 \\mathrm{W} + 200 \\mathrm{A} + 10 \\mathrm{D} + 10 \\mathrm{S} + \\mathrm{E} + \\mathrm{H} = 2030$.\nStep 5:  We can then deduce that $200 \\mathrm{A} + 10 \\mathrm{D} + 10 \\mathrm{S} + \\mathrm{E} + \\mathrm{H}$ must be equal to $30$ because $1000 \\mathrm{W}$ is a multiple of $1000$ and cannot be equal to $0$.\nStep 6:  Since $\\mathrm{A}, \\mathrm{D}, \\mathrm{E}, \\mathrm{H}, \\mathrm{S}$, and $\\mathrm{W}$ are distinct digits, we can conclude that $\\mathrm{A}$ must be equal to $0$.\nStep 7:  This leads us to the equation $10 \\mathrm{D} + 10 \\mathrm{S} + \\mathrm{E} + \\mathrm{H} = 30$. We can then deduce that $\\mathrm{D}+\\mathrm{E}$ must be less than or equal to $9$.\nStep 8:  To maximize $\\mathrm{D}+\\mathrm{E}$, we need to maximize the value of $\\mathrm{D}$ and $\\mathrm{E}$ while ensuring that they are distinct digits.\nStep 9:  We can then try different combinations of $\\mathrm{D}$ and $\\mathrm{E}$ to find the largest possible value of $\\mathrm{D}+\\mathrm{E}$.\nStep 10:  After trying different combinations, we find that the largest possible value of $\\mathrm{D}+\\mathrm{E}$ is $\\boxed{8}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$",

Substituting $x=10$ into the function $f(x)$ gives us $f(10)=2^{10}+10^{2}=1024+100=1124$.\nStep 3:  The units digit of $f(10)$ is $4$, so we are looking for the smallest integer $n>10$ such that the units digit of $f(n)$ is also $4$.\nStep 4:  We can start by checking the units digit of $f(n)$ for $n=11,12,13,14,15$. We find that the units digit of $f(11)$ is $5$, the units digit of $f(12)$ is $4$, the units digit of $f(13)$ is $9$, the units digit of $f(14)$ is $6$, and the units digit of $f(15)$ is $1$.\nStep 5:  We notice that the units digit of $f(12)$ is $4$, which is the same as the units digit of $f(10)$. Therefore, the smallest integer $n>10$ such that $f(n)$ and $f(10)$ have the same units digit is $n=12$.\nStep 6:  Hence, the final answer is $\\boxed{12}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps. First, we should analyze the given information and understand the relationships between the different points and line segments in the rectangle $P A U L$.\nStep 2:  We are given that point $D$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{U L}$, and points $E$ and $F$ lie on $\\overline{P L}$ and $\\overline{P A}$, respectively. We also have the ratios $\\frac{P E}{E L}=\\frac{3}{2}$ and $\\frac{P F}{F A}=2$.\nStep 3:  We can start by using the given ratios to find the lengths of $P E$, $E L$, $P F$, and $F A$. Using the ratio $\\frac{P E}{E L}=\\frac{3}{2}$, we can express $P E$ as $3x$ and $E L$ as $2x$ for some value of $x$. Similarly, using the ratio $\\frac{P F}{F A}=2$, we can express $P F$ as $2y$ and $F A$ as $y$ for some value of $y$.\nStep 4:  We are also given that $P A=36$ and $P L=25$. We can use these values to find the lengths of $P E$, $E L$, $P F$, and $F A$.\nStep 5:  Next, we need to find the length of $U L$, which is twice the length of $D U$ since $D$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{U L}$. We can then use the length of $U L$ to find the area of triangle $P U L$.\nStep 6:  After finding the area of triangle $P U L$, we can find the area of triangle $P E L$ and triangle $P F A$ using their respective bases and heights.\nStep 7:  Finally, we can find the area of pentagon $A U D E F$ by subtracting the areas of triangles $P E L$ and $P F A$ from the area of triangle $P U L$ and adding the area of triangle $A U D$.\n\nStep 8:  Now, let's calculate the lengths of $P E$, $E L$, $P F$, and $F A$ using the given ratios and the length of $P A$.\nStep 9:  We have $P E = 3x$ and $E L = 2x$, and $P F = 2y$ and $F A = y$. We also know that $P A = 36$, so we can set up the equation $3x + 2x = 36$ to solve for $x$. Similarly, we can set up the equation $2y + y = 36$ to solve for $y$.\nStep 10:  Solving these equations, we find that $x = 6$ and $y = 12$.\n\nStep 11:  Now that we have the values of $x$ and $y$, we can find the lengths of $P E$, $E L$, $P F$, and $F A$.\nStep 12:  We have $P E = 3x = 3(6) = 18$, $E L = 2x = 2(6) = 12$, $P F = 2y = 2(12) = 24$, and $F A = y = 12$.\n\nStep 13:  Next, we need to find the length of $U L$, which is twice the length of $D U$ since $D$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{U L}$. We can then use the length of $U L$ to find the area of triangle $P U L$.\nStep 14:  We have $U L = 2 \\cdot 12 = 24$.\n\nStep 15:  Now, we can find the area of triangle $P U L$ using the formula for the area of a triangle: $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\text{base} \\cdot \\text{height}$.\nStep 16:  The base of triangle $P U L$ is $P L = 25$, and the height is $U L = 24$, so the area of triangle $P U L$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 25 \\cdot 24 = 300$.\n\nStep 17:  Next, we need to find the area of triangle $P E L$ and triangle $P F A$ using their respective bases and heights.\nStep 18:  The base of triangle $P E L$ is $E L = 12$, and the height is $P L = 25$, so the area of triangle $P E L$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 12 \\cdot 25 = 150$.\nStep 19:  The base of triangle $P F A$ is $F A = 12$, and the height is $P A = 36$, so the area of triangle $P F A$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 12 \\cdot 36 = 216$.\n\nStep 20:  Finally, we can find the area of pentagon $A U D E F$ by subtracting the areas of triangles $P E L$ and $P F A$ from the area of triangle $P U L$ and adding the area of triangle $A U D$.\nStep 21:  The area of triangle $A U D$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 12 \\cdot 24 = 144$.\nStep 22:  Therefore, the area of pentagon $A U D E F$ is $300 - 150 - 216 + 144 = 78$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{78}$",

This can be done by finding the area of the rectangle $F U N K$ and then subtracting the area of the rectangle $F A K E$ that is outside of $F U N K$.\nStep 6:  The area of the rectangle $F U N K$ is given by $U K \\times U F = \\frac{5 T - 12}{5} \\times \\frac{12}{5}$.\nStep 7:  The area of the rectangle $F A K E$ that is outside of $F U N K$ is given by $A K \\times E F = \\frac{T}{3} \\times T$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the area of the intersection of the two rectangles is given by the difference between the area of $F U N K$ and the area of $F A K E$ outside of $F U N K$.\nStep 9:  Substituting the given value of $T=67$, we can calculate the area of the intersection of the two rectangles.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{408}$",

We are dealing with a regular tetrahedron, which is a three-dimensional shape with four equilateral triangular faces. The tetrahedra $J A N E, J O H N$, and $J O A N$ have non-overlapping interiors, meaning they do not intersect with each other.\nStep 2:  We are asked to compute $\\tan \\angle H A E$, which involves finding the tangent of the angle formed by the intersection of the three tetrahedra.\nStep 3:  To approach this problem, we can use the properties of the tetrahedra and the given information to find the lengths of the sides and the angles involved.\nStep 4:  We are given that the tetrahedra are regular, which means all their edges have the same length. Let's denote this length as $s$.\nStep 5:  We can then use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of the altitude of the tetrahedron, which is the line segment from the vertex to the base of the tetrahedron.\nStep 6:  The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\nStep 7:  Using this theorem, we can find the length of the altitude of the tetrahedron, which is $\\frac{s \\sqrt{6}}{3}$.\nStep 8:  Next, we can use the properties of the tetrahedra to find the lengths of the sides of the triangle $H A E$.\nStep 9:  We can then use the Law of Cosines to find the cosine of the angle $\\angle H A E$.\nStep 10:  Finally, we can use the trigonometric identity $\\tan \\theta = \\frac{\\sin \\theta}{\\cos \\theta}$ to find the tangent of the angle $\\angle H A E$.\nStep 11:  By following these steps, we can compute the value of $\\tan \\angle H A E$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\sqrt{3}}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of selfies required so that each pair of the eight students appears in exactly one selfie.\nStep 2:  We can start by considering the total number of pairs of students.

Substituting $n=8$, we get $\\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8 \\cdot 7}{2} = 28$ pairs of students.\nStep 3:  Now, we need to find the minimum number of selfies required to ensure that each pair of students appears in exactly one selfie. This can be achieved by creating a complete graph with 8 vertices, where each vertex represents a student. Each edge in the graph represents a pair of students.\nStep 4:  The minimum number of selfies required is equivalent to the minimum number of edges in a complete graph with 8 vertices.

This means that we can create a complete graph with 8 vertices and then add edges to form triangles (3-student selfies) to minimize the total number of selfies.\nStep 6:  To do this, we can start by creating a complete graph with 8 vertices, which gives us 28 edges. Then, we can add edges to form triangles, which will reduce the total number of edges. The minimum number of edges required to form triangles is 7, as each triangle has 3 edges and we need to add 7 edges to form 7 triangles.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the minimum number of selfies required is the total number of edges in the complete graph minus the number of edges added to form triangles, which is $28 - 7 = 21$ selfies.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{21}$",

We are also given that $LE = \\frac{1}{n}$ for some positive real number $n$, and we need to find the least possible value of $[LEO]$ as $n$ ranges over the positive reals.\nStep 2:  We can start by using the Law of Sines to relate the side lengths of the triangle to the sines of the angles. The Law of Sines states that for any triangle with angle measures $A$, $B$, and $C$, and opposite side lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$, respectively, we have $\\frac{a}{\\sin A} = \\frac{b}{\\sin B} = \\frac{c}{\\sin C}$.\nStep 3:  Applying the Law of Sines to $\\triangle LEO$, we get $\\frac{L E}{\\sin \\angle E O L} = \\frac{E O}{\\sin \\angle L E O}$.

In this case, each guest has 7 choices for an appetizer, $K$ choices for an entr\u00e9e, and 2 choices for dessert, giving a total of $7 \\cdot K \\cdot 2 = 14K$ possible orders.\nStep 5:  However, we are told that there are $T$ possible different orders, which means that the total number of possible orders, including the optional dessert choice, is $T$.\nStep 6:  To account for the optional dessert choice, we need to consider the cases where dessert is ordered and where it is not ordered. If a guest orders dessert, there are $14K$ possible orders. If a guest does not order dessert, there are $7 \\cdot K = 7K$ possible orders.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the total number of possible orders, including the optional dessert choice, is $14K + 7K = 21K$.\nStep 8:  We are given that this total is equal to $T$, which is 210.

This means that the number of digits in the doubled number is one more than the number of digits in the original number.\nStep 4:  We can then consider the numbers that gain an extra digit when doubled in the range $10^k a + b$ to $10^k a + 2b$. These numbers are of the form $10^k a + b$ where $a$ and $b$ are digits, and $a \\neq 0$.\nStep 5:  We can calculate the number of such numbers for each value of $k$ and find the total count of numbers that gain an extra digit when doubled up to that point.\nStep 6:  By summing up the counts for each value of $k$, we can find the total count of numbers that gain an extra digit when doubled up to a certain point.\nStep 7:  We can then use this information to find the $2011^{\\text {th }}$ smallest positive integer $N$ that gains an extra digit when doubled.\nStep 8:  We can calculate the value of $N$ using the formula $N = 10^k a + b$ where $a$ and $b$ are the digits that satisfy the given conditions.\nStep 9:  By following these steps, we can find the $2011^{\\text {th }}$ smallest positive integer $N$ that gains an extra digit when doubled.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{888888882110}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given information and apply geometric principles to find the value of the radius $r$ of the circle centered at $M$.\nStep 2:  First, we're given that triangle $ABC$ is a right-angled triangle with right angle at $C$. This means that the circle centered at $M$ is tangent to both $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{BC}$ at $C$.\nStep 3:  We're also given that $AC=5$ and $BC=12$. We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of side $AB$. The theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\nStep 4:  Applying the Pythagorean Theorem, we get $AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2 = 5^2 + 12^2 = 25 + 144 = 169$. Taking the square root of both sides, we find that $AB = 13$.\nStep 5:  Now, let's consider the point of tangency of the circle with $\\overline{AB}$, which we'll call $D$. Since the circle is tangent to both $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{BC}$ at $C$, we can see that $CD$ is perpendicular to $\\overline{AB}$.\nStep 6:  We can also observe that $CD$ is a radius of the circle, so $CD=r$. Additionally, $AD$ is a segment of $\\overline{AB}$, and $BD$ is a segment of $\\overline{AB}$ as well.\nStep 7:  Since $CD$ is perpendicular to $\\overline{AB}$, we can use the fact that the product of the lengths of the segments of a line that are formed by a transversal through a point outside the line is constant. This gives us the equation $AD \\cdot BD = CD^2$.\nStep 8:  Substituting the values we know, we get $AD \\cdot BD = r^2$. We also know that $AD + BD = AB = 13$, so we can express $BD$ as $13 - AD$.\nStep 9:  Substituting this into the equation $AD \\cdot BD = r^2$, we get $AD(13 - AD) = r^2$. Expanding this, we have $13AD - AD^2 = r^2$.\nStep 10:  We also know that $AD + BD = 13$, so $AD + (13 - AD) = 13$, which simplifies to $13 = 13$. This doesn't give us any new information, so we need to look for another relationship between $AD$ and $BD$.\nStep 11:  Since $M$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AC}$, we can use the fact that the length of the median to the hypotenuse of a right triangle is half the length of the hypotenuse. This means that $AM = MC = \\frac{AC}{2} = \\frac{5}{2}$.\nStep 12:  Now, we can use the fact that $AD + DC = AC = 5$. Since $DC = r$, we have $AD + r = 5$.\nStep 13:  We can also use the fact that $BD = BC - CD = 12 - r$. Substituting this into the equation $AD + BD = 13$, we get $AD + (12 - r) = 13$.\nStep 14:  Simplifying this, we have $AD - r = 1$. Now we have a system of two equations: $AD + r = 5$ and $AD - r = 1$.\nStep 15:  Adding these two equations together, we get $2AD = 6$, so $AD = 3$. Substituting this back into the equation $AD + r = 5$, we find that $r = 2$.\nStep 16:  Therefore, the radius of the circle centered at $M$ is $\\boxed{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",

Since $b$ must be an integer, the largest possible value of $b$ is $6$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the possible values of $b$ are $7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211, 212, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217, 218, 219, 220, 221, 222, 223, 224, 225, 226, 227, 228, 229, 230, 231, 232, 233, 234, 235, 236, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241, 242, 243, 244, 245, 246, 247, 248, 249, 250, 251, 252, 253, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 259, 260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269, 270, 271, 272, 273, 274, 275, 276, 277, 278, 279, 280, 281, 282, 283, 284, 285, 286, 287, 288, 289, 290, 291, 292, 293, 294, 295, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 308, 309, 310, 311, 312, 313, 314, 315, 316, 317, 318, 319, 320, 321, 322, 323, 324, 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, 330, 331, 332, 333, 334, 335, 336, 337, 338, 339, 340, 341, 342, 343, 344, 345, 346, 347, 348, 349, 350, 351, 352, 353, 354, 355, 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361, 362, 363, 364, 365, 366, 367, 368, 369, 370, 371, 372, 373, 374, 375, 376, 377, 378, 379, 380, 381, 382, 383, 384, 385, 386, 387, 388, 389, 390, 391, 392, 393, 394, 395, 396, 397, 398, 399, 400, 401, 402, 403, 404, 405, 406, 407, 408, 409, 410, 411, 412, 413, 414, 415, 416, 417, 418, 419, 420, 421, 422, 423, 424, 425, 426, 427, 428, 429, 430, 431, 432, 433, 434, 435, 436, 437, 438, 439, 440, 441, 442, 443, 444, 445, 446, 447, 448, 449, 450, 451, 452, 453, 454, 455, 456, 457, 458, 459, 460, 461, 462, 463, 464, 465, 466, 467, 468, 469, 470, 471, 472, 473, 474, 475, 476, 477, 478, 479, 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488, 489, 490, 491, 492, 493, 494, 495, 496, 497, 498, 499, 500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 505, 506, 507, 508, 509, 510, 511, 512, 513, 514, 515, 516, 517, 518, 519, 520, 521, 522, 523, 524, 525, 526, 527, 528, 529, 530, 531, 532, 533, 534, 535, 536, 537, 538, 539, 540, 541, 542, 543, 544, 545, 546, 547, 548, 549, 550, 551, 552, 553, 554, 555, 556, 557, 558, 559, 560,",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first understand the given information and what is being asked. We are given a right-angled triangle $ABC$ with a right angle at $C$ and $AB=40$. We are also given that $AC-BC=T-1$, where $T=35$.\nStep 2:  The problem asks us to find the area of triangle $ABC$, denoted as $[ABC]$.\nStep 3:  We can start by using the Pythagorean Theorem to relate the sides of the triangle. The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\nStep 4:  In this case, we have $AB^2=AC^2+BC^2$. We are given that $AB=40$, so we can substitute this value into the equation to get $40^2=AC^2+BC^2$.\nStep 5:  We are also given that $AC-BC=T-1$, where $T=35$. Substituting this value, we get $AC-BC=35-1=34$.\nStep 6:  We can use the equation $AC-BC=34$ to express $AC$ in terms of $BC$. This gives us $AC=BC+34$.\nStep 7:  Substituting this expression for $AC$ into the Pythagorean Theorem equation, we get $40^2=(BC+34)^2+BC^2$.\nStep 8:  Expanding and simplifying this equation, we get $1600=2BC^2+68BC+1156$.\nStep 9:  Rearranging the terms, we get $2BC^2+68BC-444=0$.\nStep 10:  We can solve this quadratic equation to find the value of $BC$.\nStep 11:  Using the quadratic formula, we get $BC=\\frac{-68\\pm\\sqrt{68^2-4(2)(-444)}}{2(2)}$.\nStep 12:  Simplifying this expression, we get $BC=\\frac{-68\\pm\\sqrt{4624+3552}}{4}$.\nStep 13:  This gives us $BC=\\frac{-68\\pm\\sqrt{8176}}{4}$.\nStep 14:  Simplifying further, we get $BC=\\frac{-68\\pm 90}{4}$.\nStep 15:  We have two possible values for $BC$, but we need to choose the positive value since $BC$ represents a length.\nStep 16:  Therefore, we have $BC=\\frac{-68+90}{4}=\\frac{22}{4}=\\frac{11}{2}$.\nStep 17:  Now that we have found the value of $BC$, we can use it to find the area of triangle $ABC$.\nStep 18:  The area of a triangle is given by the formula $[ABC]=\\frac{1}{2}(AB)(BC)$.\nStep 19:  Substituting the values we have found, we get $[ABC]=\\frac{1}{2}(40)\\left(\\frac{11}{2}\\right)$.\nStep 20:  Simplifying this expression, we get $[ABC]=\\frac{1}{2}(40)(11/2)=\\frac{1}{2}(220)=110$.\nStep 21:  Therefore, the area of triangle $ABC$ is $110$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{110}$",

The change-of-base formula states that $\\log _{a} b = \\frac{\\log _{c} b}{\\log _{c} a}$ for any positive real numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$ where $c \\neq 1$.\nStep 3:  Applying this formula to our given equation, we get $\\log _{\\sqrt{2}} x = \\frac{\\log _{2} x}{\\log _{2} \\sqrt{2}}$.\nStep 4:  We know that $\\log _{2} \\sqrt{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$, so we can simplify the equation to $\\log _{\\sqrt{2}} x = 2 \\log _{2} x$.\nStep 5:  Given that $\\log _{\\sqrt{2}} x = 20$, we can equate this to $2 \\log _{2} x$ and solve for $\\log _{2} x$. This gives us $\\log _{2} x = 10$.\nStep 6:  Now, we need to find the value of $\\log _{2} \\sqrt{x}$. We can use the property of logarithms that states $\\log _{a} b^c = c \\log _{a} b$.\nStep 7:  Applying this property, we get $\\log _{2} \\sqrt{x} = \\log _{2} x^{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\log _{2} x$.\nStep 8:  Substituting the value of $\\log _{2} x$ we found earlier, we get $\\log _{2} \\sqrt{x} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 10 = \\boxed{5}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first understand the possible outcomes when Hannah and Otto flip their coins.\nStep 2:  Hannah flips two fair coins, which means she can get either 0, 1, or 2 heads. On the other hand, Otto flips $T=5$ fair coins, so he can get 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 heads.\nStep 3:  We are interested in finding the probability that the number of heads showing on Hannah's coins is greater than the number of heads showing on Otto's coins.\nStep 4:  To approach this, we need to consider the different scenarios where Hannah gets more heads than Otto.\nStep 5:  If Hannah gets 2 heads, then Otto must get 0 or 1 heads for Hannah to have more heads. This gives us a probability of $\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{32} + \\frac{5}{32} \\right) = \\frac{6}{128}$.\nStep 6:  If Hannah gets 1 head, then Otto must get 0 heads for Hannah to have more heads. This gives us a probability of $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{32} = \\frac{1}{64}$.\nStep 7:  Adding these probabilities together, we get $p = \\frac{6}{128} + \\frac{1}{64} = \\frac{6}{128} + \\frac{2}{128} = \\frac{8}{128} = \\frac{1}{16}$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the probability $p$ is $\\frac{1}{16}$, and the sum of the numerator and denominator of $p$ is $1+16=17$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{17}$",

This allows us to rewrite the expression as $100000(1 + 0.002)^{10}$.\nStep 4:  Using the binomial theorem, we can expand $(1 + 0.002)^{10}$ to get $1 + \\binom{10}{1} (0.002) + \\binom{10}{2} (0.002)^2 + \\dots + (0.002)^{10}$.\nStep 5:  We can then simplify this expression to get $1 + 0.02 + 0.0002 + \\dots + (0.002)^{10}$.\nStep 6:  This is a finite geometric series with first term $1$, common ratio $0.002$, and $11$ terms.\nStep 7:  We can use the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series to find the sum of this series.\nStep 8:  The sum of the series is $1 + 0.02 + 0.0002 + \\dots + (0.002)^{10} = \\frac{1 - (0.002)^{11}}{1 - 0.002}$.\nStep 9:  Multiplying this by $100000$ gives us $100000 \\cdot \\frac{1 - (0.002)^{11}}{1 - 0.002}$.\nStep 10:  Simplifying this expression, we get $100000 \\cdot \\frac{1 - (0.002)^{11}}{0.998}$.\nStep 11:  This can be further simplified to $\\frac{100000(1 - (0.002)^{11})}{0.998}$.\nStep 12:  We can then calculate the value of this expression to find the greatest integer less than or equal to it.\nStep 13:  After performing the calculations, we find that the value is approximately $126.988$, and the greatest integer less than or equal to this value is $\\boxed{126}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{126}$",

We are asked to find the value of the base $b$ for which the product of these two numbers is equal to a number in base $b$ with digits $X, Y, Z$.\nStep 2:  We start by expressing the given numbers in terms of the base $b$. The number $253_b$ can be written as $2b^2 + 5b + 3$, and the number $341_b$ can be expressed as $3b^2 + 4b + 1$.\nStep 3:  We are then given the equation $(2b^2 + 5b + 3)(3b^2 + 4b + 1) = 7b^4 + Xb^3 + Yb^2 + Zb$.\nStep 4:  By expanding the left-hand side of the equation, we get $6b^4 + 17b^3 + 28b^2 + 14b + 3$.\nStep 5:  We then compare the coefficients of the powers of $b$ on both sides of the equation to find the values of $X, Y, Z$.\nStep 6:  We find that $X = 1$, $Y = 8$, and $Z = 3$.\nStep 7:  Now, we need to find the value of $b$ that satisfies the equation $6b^4 + 17b^3 + 28b^2 + 14b + 3 = 7b^4 + Xb^3 + Yb^2 + Zb$.\nStep 8:  By equating the coefficients of the powers of $b$ on both sides, we get the equation $6b^4 + 17b^3 + 28b^2 + 14b + 3 = 7b^4 + b^3 + 8b^2 + 3b$.\nStep 9:  Simplifying this equation, we get $b^4 - 16b^3 + 20b^2 - 11b + 3 = 0$.\nStep 10:  We then use the Rational Root Theorem to find the possible rational roots of this equation.\nStep 11:  The possible rational roots are $\\pm 1, \\pm 3$.\nStep 12:  We then test these possible roots by substituting them into the equation to find the value of $b$ that satisfies the equation.\nStep 13:  After testing the possible roots, we find that $b = 6$ is a root of the equation.\nStep 14:  Therefore, the value of the base $b$ for which the product of $253_b$ and $341_b$ is equal to a number in base $b$ with digits $X, Y, Z$ is $b = \\boxed{6}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$",

This equation represents the points of intersection between the line and the curve.\nStep 3:  We can then solve for $x$ by using the identity $\\sin^2x=1-\\cos^2x$. Substituting this into the equation gives us $4x=10\\pi(1-\\cos^2x)$.\nStep 4:  Simplifying further, we get $4x=10\\pi-10\\pi\\cos^2x$. Rearranging the terms, we have $10\\pi\\cos^2x=10\\pi-4x$.\nStep 5:  Dividing both sides by $10\\pi$, we obtain $\\cos^2x=1-\\frac{2}{5\\pi}x$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $\\cos x=\\pm\\sqrt{1-\\frac{2}{5\\pi}x}$.\nStep 6:  Since we are interested in the first quadrant, we only consider the positive square root, so $\\cos x=\\sqrt{1-\\frac{2}{5\\pi}x}$.\nStep 7:  We then use the identity $\\sin^2x=1-\\cos^2x$ to express $\\sin x$ in terms of $x$. This gives us $\\sin x=\\sqrt{1-\\left(1-\\frac{2}{5\\pi}x\\right)}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{5\\pi}x}$.\nStep 8:  Now, we can find the length of the segment of the graph of $y=4x$ that lies below the graph of $y=10\\pi\\sin^2x$ by integrating the difference between the two functions with respect to $x$ from $0$ to the point of intersection.\nStep 9:  The length of the segment is given by the integral $\\int_{0}^{\\frac{5\\pi}{2}}\\left(10\\pi\\sin^2x-4x\\right)dx$.\nStep 10:  Evaluating this integral, we get $\\int_{0}^{\\frac{5\\pi}{2}}\\left(10\\pi\\sin^2x-4x\\right)dx=\\left[-10\\pi\\frac{x}{2}+\\frac{10\\pi}{2}\\sin^2x-2x^2\\right]_{0}^{\\frac{5\\pi}{2}}$.\nStep 11:  Simplifying further, we have $\\left[-10\\pi\\frac{x}{2}+\\frac{10\\pi}{2}\\sin^2x-2x^2\\right]_{0}^{\\frac{5\\pi}{2}}=\\left(-25\\pi+25\\pi-25\\pi^2\\right)-\\left(0+0-0\\right)$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the length of the segment is $-25\\pi+25\\pi-25\\pi^2$.\nStep 13:  Finally, we need to find the sum of the lengths of all the segments of the graph of $y=4x$ that lie in the first quadrant, below the graph of $y=10\\pi\\sin^2x$.

  "Step 1:  The problem involves finding the number of degree $n$ polynomials with integer coefficients, where the reversed polynomial has the same zeros as the original polynomial, and all the reversed polynomial's zeros are real and integers.\nStep 2:  We are given that the reversed polynomial has the same zeros as the original polynomial, which means that if $r$ is a root of the original polynomial, then $\\frac{1}{r}$ is a root of the reversed polynomial.\nStep 3:  Since all the reversed polynomial's zeros are real and integers, this implies that the original polynomial can have at most 7 distinct roots, as $n \\leq 7$.\nStep 4:  We can express the original polynomial as a product of its linear factors, where each factor corresponds to a root of the polynomial. This gives us the form $a_n(x-r_1)(x-r_2)\\ldots(x-r_n)$, where $r_i$ are the roots of the polynomial.\nStep 5:  The reversed polynomial can be expressed as $a_0(x-\\tfrac{1}{r_1})(x-\\tfrac{1}{r_2})\\ldots(x-\\tfrac{1}{r_n})$, and since the coefficients of the reversed polynomial are integers, this implies that $r_i$ must be of the form $\\tfrac{1}{r_i}$ for some integer $r_i$.\nStep 6:  This means that the roots of the original polynomial are of the form $r_i = \\tfrac{1}{r_i}$, which leads to $r_i^2 = 1$.

We are interested in finding the number of noncongruent triangles that can be formed in this manner.\nStep 3:  We start by considering the possible combinations of sides that can be extended to form a triangle. Since the 16-gon is regular, the length of each side is the same. Therefore, the only factor that affects the formation of noncongruent triangles is the choice of the three sides to be extended.\nStep 4:  We can choose any three sides from the 16 available sides to form a triangle. However, we need to consider the cases where the three sides form a triangle with a vertex on the 16-gon, as these will result in congruent triangles.\nStep 5:  The only way to form a triangle with a vertex on the 16-gon is to choose three consecutive sides.

Since the area of each square is 9, we have $s^2 = 9$, which gives us $s = 3$.\nStep 4:  Now, we need to find the area of the non-overlapping region. This can be calculated by subtracting the area of the overlapping region from the total area of the top tile, which is $9 - 8 = 1$.\nStep 5:  The non-overlapping region forms a parallelogram with a base of $3 \\sin \\theta$ and a height of $3 \\cos \\theta$. The area of this parallelogram is given by the product of its base and height, which is $3 \\sin \\theta \\cdot 3 \\cos \\theta = 9 \\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta$.\nStep 6:  We are given that this area is equal to 1, so we have the equation $9 \\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta = 1$.\nStep 7:  We can use the trigonometric identity $\\sin 2\\theta = 2\\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta$ to rewrite the equation as $9 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\sin 2\\theta = 1$, which simplifies to $\\sin 2\\theta = \\frac{2}{9}$.\nStep 8:  Now, we can use the double-angle identity for sine to express $\\sin \\theta + \\cos \\theta$ in terms of $\\sin 2\\theta$.\nStep 9:  The double-angle identity for sine is $\\sin 2\\theta = 2\\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta$, and we can rearrange this to get $\\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta = \\frac{1}{2} \\sin 2\\theta$.\nStep 10:  We can then use the Pythagorean identity $\\sin^2 \\theta + \\cos^2 \\theta = 1$ to express $\\sin \\theta + \\cos \\theta$ in terms of $\\sin 2\\theta$.\nStep 11:  By substituting $\\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta = \\frac{1}{2} \\sin 2\\theta$ into the Pythagorean identity, we get $\\sin^2 \\theta + \\cos^2 \\theta = 1 = \\sin^2 \\theta + \\frac{1}{4} \\sin^2 2\\theta$.\nStep 12:  We can then use the fact that $\\sin 2\\theta = \\frac{2}{9}$ to find the value of $\\sin \\theta + \\cos \\theta$.\nStep 13:  Substituting $\\sin 2\\theta = \\frac{2}{9}$ into the equation $\\sin^2 \\theta + \\frac{1}{4} \\sin^2 2\\theta = 1$, we get $\\sin^2 \\theta + \\frac{1}{4} \\left( \\frac{2}{9} \\right)^2 = 1$.\nStep 14:  Solving for $\\sin^2 \\theta$, we find $\\sin^2 \\theta = 1 - \\frac{1}{4} \\left( \\frac{2}{9} \\right)^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{324} = \\frac{323}{324}$.\nStep 15:  Taking the square root of both sides, we get $\\sin \\theta = \\sqrt{\\frac{323}{324}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{323}}{\\sqrt{324}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{323}}{18}$.\nStep 16:  Similarly, we can find $\\cos \\theta$ by using the Pythagorean identity $\\cos^2 \\theta = 1 - \\sin^2 \\theta$.\nStep 17:  Substituting $\\sin^2 \\theta = \\frac{323}{324}$ into the equation $\\cos^2 \\theta = 1 - \\sin^2 \\theta$, we get $\\cos^2 \\theta = 1 - \\frac{323}{324} = \\frac{1}{324}$.\nStep 18:  Taking the square root of both sides, we get $\\cos \\theta = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{324}} = \\frac{1}{18}$.\nStep 19:  Finally, we can find $\\sin \\theta + \\cos \\theta$ by adding the values of $\\sin \\theta$ and $\\cos \\theta$.\nStep 20:  Therefore, $\\sin \\theta + \\cos \\theta = \\frac{\\sqrt{323}}{18} + \\frac{1}{18} = \\frac{\\sqrt{323} + 1}{18}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{323} + 1}{18}}$",

This means that for the three-digit numbers $M=\\underline{4} \\underline{A} \\underline{6}$ and $N=\\underline{1} \\underline{B} \\underline{7}$, the sums of their digits must not be divisible by 9.\nStep 3:  We are given that neither $M$ nor $N$ is divisible by 9, so the sums of their digits, $4+A+6$ and $1+B+7$, must not be divisible by 9.\nStep 4:  This implies that $A+10$ and $B+8$ are not divisible by 9. In other words, $A+10$ and $B+8$ leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 9.\nStep 5:  Now, we need to find the product $M \\cdot N$, which is equal to $(4 \\cdot 1 + A \\cdot 1 + 6 \\cdot 7) + (4 \\cdot B + 6 \\cdot 1 + A \\cdot 7)$.\nStep 6:  Simplifying this expression, we get $43 + A + 7B$.\nStep 7:  Since the product $M \\cdot N$ is divisible by 9, the sum $43 + A + 7B$ must be divisible by 9.\nStep 8:  We can rewrite this as $43 + A + 7B \\equiv 0 \\pmod 9$, which simplifies to $A + 7B \\equiv 5 \\pmod 9$.\nStep 9:  Now, we need to find the largest possible value of $A+B$.\nStep 10:  To do this, we need to find the largest possible value of $A$ and $B$ such that $A + 7B \\equiv 5 \\pmod 9$.\nStep 11:  We can start by trying different values of $B$ and finding the corresponding values of $A$ that satisfy the congruence.\nStep 12:  We find that when $B=5$, we get $A=2$, and when $B=8$, we get $A=5$.\nStep 13:  Therefore, the largest possible value of $A+B$ is $5+8=\\boxed{13}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{13}$",

Therefore, we can find the measure of each interior angle by dividing the total sum of the interior angles by the number of sides, which is 12.\nStep 5:  So, the measure of each interior angle is $\\frac{1800^{\\circ}}{12} = 150^{\\circ}$.\nStep 6:  Therefore, the value of $d$ is $\\boxed{150}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{150}$",

We are given a triangle with vertices at $(1,1)$, $(B,7)$, and $(17,1)$, and we need to find the probability that a randomly selected point $(x,y)$ from the interior of this triangle satisfies the condition $x>A-1$.\nStep 2:  The first step is to determine the value of $A$, which is the sum of the digits of the number obtained from position 7. Since the number from position 7 is 7, the sum of its digits is simply 7. Therefore, $A=7$.\nStep 3:  Next, we need to find the value of $B$, which is the sum of the digits of the number obtained from position 9. The number from position 9 is 9, so the sum of its digits is 9. Hence, $B=9$.\nStep 4:  Now, we need to find the area of the triangle. The base of the triangle is the distance between the points $(1,1)$ and $(17,1)$, which is $17-1=16$. The height of the triangle is the distance between the points $(B,7)$ and $(1,1)$, which is $7-1=6$.\nStep 5:  The area of the triangle can be calculated using the formula $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$.

We can express the length of the shorter base as $b_1 = b_2 - 3$.\nStep 5:  Substituting the given values into the area formula, we get $\\frac{1}{2}(b_1 + b_2) \\cdot 2 = 17$. Simplifying this equation, we find that $b_1 + b_2 = 17$.\nStep 6:  We can now substitute $b_1 = b_2 - 3$ into the equation $b_1 + b_2 = 17$ to solve for $b_2$. This gives us $b_2 - 3 + b_2 = 17$, which simplifies to $2b_2 - 3 = 17$.\nStep 7:  Solving for $b_2$, we find that $2b_2 = 20$, and therefore $b_2 = 10$. Substituting this value back into the equation $b_1 = b_2 - 3$, we get $b_1 = 7$.\nStep 8:  Now that we have the lengths of the bases, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of one of the congruent sides of the trapezoid. The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\nStep 9:  In this case, the height of the trapezoid is the leg of the right triangle, and half the difference between the bases is the other leg. Therefore, the length of one of the congruent sides can be found using the equation $s^2 = 2^2 + (10-7)^2$.\nStep 10:  Solving for $s$, we get $s^2 = 4 + 9$, which simplifies to $s^2 = 13$. Taking the square root of both sides, we find that $s = \\sqrt{13}$.\nStep 11:  Finally, we need to find the sum of the length of the shorter base and the length of one of the congruent sides. This is given by $b_1 + s = 7 + \\sqrt{13}$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the sum of the length of the shorter base and the length of one of the congruent sides is $7 + \\sqrt{13}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7 + \\sqrt{13}}",
