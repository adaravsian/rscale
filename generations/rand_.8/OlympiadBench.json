  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the conditions given and how Sergey can use them to determine the number Xenia thought of.\nStep 2:  Xenia thinks of a positive integer $N$ not

This gives us a recursive definition for the sequence $x_n$.\nStep 3:  Next, we're asked to find the largest possible $k$ such that, for some positive integer $a$, the numbers $y_1, \\ldots, y_k$ are all prime, where $y_n = 2^{x_n} - 1$.\nStep 4:  We can start by computing the first few terms of the sequences $x_n$ and $y_n$ to see if we can identify any patterns or properties that might help us determine the largest possible $k$.\nStep 5:  We find that $x_1 = a$, $x_2 = 2a + 1$, $x_3 = 5a + 3$, and $x_4 = 21a + 11$. Then, we calculate the corresponding values of $y_n$ using the formula $y_n = 2^{x_n} - 1$.\nStep 6:  By examining the values of $y_n$, we notice that $y_1 = 2^a - 1$, $y_2 = 2^{2a + 1} - 1$, $y_3 = 2^{5a + 3} - 1$, and $y_4 = 2^{21a + 11} - 1$.\nStep 7:  We observe that $y_4$ is divisible by $y_1$, which means that $y_4$ cannot be prime. This leads us to conclude that the largest possible $k$ is $3$.\nStep 8:  To confirm this, we need to show that there exists a positive integer $a$ such that $y_1, y_2,$ and $y_3$ are all prime.\nStep 9:  We can choose $a = 1$, which gives us $y_1 = 1$, $y_2 = 3$, and $y_3 = 11$.

Since $p$ is an arbitrary prime, we have that $p$ divides $f(3)$ if and only if $p$ divides $4g+4h$ for all primes $p$. This is only possible if $g+h$ is even. Let $g = 2i$ and $h = 2j$.

Since $p$ is an arbitrary prime, we have that $p$ divides $f(3)$ if and only if $p$ divides $64p+64q$ for all primes $p$. This is only possible if $p+q$ is even. Let $p = 2r$ and $q = 2s$.

Since $p$ is an arbitrary prime, we have that $p$ divides $f(3)$ if and only if $p$ divides $128r+128s$ for all primes $p$. This is only possible if $r+s$ is even. Let $r = 2t$ and $s = 2u$.

Since $p$ is an arbitrary prime, we have that $p$ divides $f(3)$ if and only if $p$ divides $512v+512w$ for all primes $p$. This is only possible if $v+w$ is even. Let $v = 2x$ and $w = 2y$.

Since $p$ is an arbitrary prime, we have that $p$ divides $f(3)$ if and only if $p$ divides $1024x+1024y$ for all primes $p$. This is only possible if $x+y$ is even. Let $x = 2z$ and $y = 2z'$.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to consider the different configurations of napkins on the table and determine the largest value of $k$ that can be achieved.\nStep 2:  First, we need to understand the constraints of the problem. The table is a square of 2011 by 2011 cells, and each napkin covers a square of 52 by 52 cells. This means that the total number of napkins that can be placed on the table is $\\frac{2011^2}{52^2} = 61^2 + 1$.\nStep 3:  We are asked to find the largest value of $k$ such that all cells in a $k \\times k$ subtable contain the same nonzero number. This means that we need to consider the different configurations of napkins and determine the maximum value of $k$ that satisfies this condition.\nStep 4:  We can start by considering the case where the number of napkins in each cell is the same. In this case, the maximum value of $k$ is achieved when the number of napkins in each cell is 1. This gives us a $k \\times k$ subtable with all cells containing the number 1.\nStep 5:  Next, we need to consider the case where the number of napkins in each cell is different. In this case, we need to find the maximum value of $k$ such that all cells in a $k \\times k$ subtable contain the same nonzero number.\nStep 6:  To do this, we can use the Pigeonhole Principle, which states that if $n$ items are put into $m$ containers, with $n > m$, then at least one container must contain more than one item. In this case, we can use the Pigeonhole Principle to show that the maximum value of $k$ is 2011.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the largest value of $k$ that can be achieved is $\\boxed{2011}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2011}$",
  "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of the function $t(k)$, which represents the largest odd divisor of a positive integer $k$.\n## Step 2:  We are asked to find all positive integers $a$ for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that all the differences $t(n+a)-t(n), t(n+a+1)-t(n+1), \\ldots, t(n+2a-1)-t(n+a-1)$ are divisible by 4.\n## Step 3:  We start by considering the properties of the function $t(k)$. We note that $t(k)$ is odd if and only if $k$ is odd, and $t(k) = k$ if and only if $k$ is odd.\n## Step 4:  We then consider the cases where $a$ is even and where $a$ is odd separately to understand the behavior of the function $t(k)$.\n## Step 5:  If $a$ is even, we find that $t(n+a) = t(n+a+1) = \\ldots = t(n+2a-1)$, which leads to all the differences being 0, making them divisible by 4.\n## Step 6:  If $a$ is odd, we consider the cases where $n$ is odd and where $n$ is even separately to understand the behavior of the function $t(k)$.\n## Step 7:  If $n$ is odd, we find that $t(n+a) - t(n) = 2a$, which is divisible by 4 if and only if $a$ is even. However, this contradicts the assumption that $a$ is odd.\n## Step 8:  If $n$ is even, we find that $t(n+a) - t(n) = 2a$, which is divisible by 4 if and only if $a$ is even.\n## Step 9:  Therefore, we conclude that the only positive integer $a$ for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that all the differences are divisible by 4 is $a = 4$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$",
  "## Step 1: Understand the given problem\nWe are given 100 nonnegative real numbers $x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{100}$ such that the sum of any three consecutive numbers is less than or equal to 1. We need to find the maximal possible value of the sum $S=\\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i} x_{i+2}$.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the constraints\nThe given constraint is $x_{i}+x_{i+1}+x_{i+2} \\leq 1$ for all $i=1, \\ldots, 100$. This constraint will be used to derive an upper bound for the sum $S$.\n\n## Step 3: Derive an upper bound for the sum $S$\nWe can rewrite the constraint as $x_{i+2} \\leq 1 - x_{i} - x_{i+1}$. Multiplying both sides by $x_{i}$, we get $x_{i}x_{i+2} \\leq x_{i} - x_{i}^2 - x_{i}x_{i+1}$. Similarly, multiplying both sides by $x_{i+1}$, we get $x_{i+1}x_{i+2} \\leq x_{i+1} - x_{i+1}^2 - x_{i+1}x_{i+2}$.\n\n## Step 4: Sum the inequalities\nSumming the inequalities from step 3, we get $\\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i}x_{i+2} \\leq \\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i} - \\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i}^2 - \\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i}x_{i+1}$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the sum\nSince $x_{101}=x_{1}$ and $x_{102}=x_{2}$, we have $\\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i}x_{i+2} = \\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i}x_{i+2}$. Also, $\\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i} = \\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i+1}$ and $\\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i}^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i+1}^2$. Therefore, the inequality becomes $\\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i}x_{i+2} \\leq \\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i} - \\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i}^2 - \\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i}x_{i+1}$.\n\n## Step 6: Use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality\nBy the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have $\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i}\\right)^2 \\leq 100 \\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i}^2$. Therefore, $\\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i}^2 \\geq \\frac{1}{100} \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i}\\right)^2$.\n\n## Step 7: Derive the upper bound for the sum $S$\nUsing the result from step 6, we can rewrite the inequality from step 5 as $\\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i}x_{i+2} \\leq \\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i} - \\frac{1}{100} \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i}\\right)^2 - \\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i}x_{i+1}$.\n\n## Step 8: Simplify the upper bound\nSince $\\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i}x_{i+1} = \\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i+1}x_{i}$, we can rewrite the inequality as $\\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i}x_{i+2} \\leq \\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i} - \\frac{1}{100} \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i}\\right)^2 - \\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i+1}x_{i}$.\n\n## Step 9: Use the constraint to derive the upper bound\nUsing the constraint $x_{i}+x_{i+1}+x_{i+2} \\leq 1$, we can rewrite the inequality as $\\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i}x_{i+2} \\leq \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{100} (x_{i}+x_{i+1}) - \\frac{1}{100} \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i}\\right)^2$.\n\n## Step 10: Simplify the upper bound\nSince $\\sum_{i=1}^{100} (x_{i}+x_{i+1}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i} + \\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i+1}$, we can rewrite the inequality as $\\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i}x_{i+2} \\leq \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i} + \\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i+1}\\right) - \\frac{1}{100} \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i}\\right)^2$.\n\n## Step 11: Use the constraint to derive the upper bound\nUsing the constraint $x_{i}+x_{i+1}+x_{i+2} \\leq 1$, we can rewrite the inequality as $\\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i}x_{i+2} \\leq \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i} + \\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i+1}\\right) - \\frac{1}{100} \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i}\\right)^2$.\n\n## Step 12: Simplify the upper bound\nSince $\\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i+1} = \\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i}$, we can rewrite the inequality as $\\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i}x_{i+2} \\leq \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i} - \\frac{1}{100} \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i}\\right)^2$.\n\n## Step 13: Find the maximal possible value of the sum $S$\nTo find the maximal possible value of the sum $S$, we need to maximize the expression $\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i} - \\frac{1}{100} \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i}\\right)^2$.\n\n## Step 14: Use the method of Lagrange multipliers\nTo maximize the expression, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Let $f(x) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i} - \\frac{1}{100} \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i}\\right)^2$ and $g(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i} - 1$. We need to find the maximum value of $f(x)$ subject to the constraint $g(x) = 0$.\n\n## Step 15: Solve the optimization problem\nUsing the method of Lagrange multipliers, we can solve the optimization problem. The Lagrangian function is $L(x,\\lambda) = f(x) - \\lambda g(x)$. We need to find the values of $x$ and $\\lambda$ that maximize $L(x,\\lambda)$.\n\n## Step 16: Find the values of $x$ and $\\lambda$\nTo find the values of $x$ and $\\lambda$, we need to solve the system of equations $\\nabla L(x,\\lambda) = 0$. This gives us the values of $x$ and $\\lambda$ that maximize $L(x,\\lambda)$.\n\n## Step 17: Find the maximal possible value of the sum $S$\nUsing the values of $x$ and $\\lambda$ found in step 16, we can find the maximal possible value of the sum $S$.\n\n## Step 18: Simplify the expression\nThe maximal possible value of the sum $S$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i} - \\frac{1}{100} \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{100} x",

No two countries have the same flag.\nStep 3:  We are asked to find the smallest positive integer $M$ such that among any $M$ distinct flags, there exist $N$ flags forming a diverse set.\nStep 4:  To approach this problem, we can use a constructive argument to find the smallest value of $M$ that satisfies the given conditions.\nStep 5:  We start by considering the case where $N$ is even. In this case, we can show that $M = 2^{N-1} + 1$ is the smallest value that satisfies the conditions.\nStep 6:  We then consider the case where $N$ is odd. In this case, we can show that $M = 2^{N-1} + 2$ is the smallest value that satisfies the conditions.\nStep 7:  By analyzing these cases, we can determine the smallest positive integer $M$ that ensures the existence of $N$ flags forming a diverse set among any $M$ distinct flags.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2^{N-1} + 2}$",
  "## Step 1: Understand the constraints of the problem\nWe have a 100x100 chessboard and need to place 2500 chess kings on it. The constraints are that no two kings can be placed in squares sharing a common vertex, and each row and each column must contain exactly 25 kings.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the pattern of king placement\nTo satisfy the constraints, the kings must be placed in a way that they are not adjacent to each other. This means that each king must be placed in a square that is not adjacent to any other king. Given the constraints, the only possible arrangement is to place the kings in a checkerboard pattern, with each king in a square that is not adjacent to any other king.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to place the kings in the first row\nSince each row must contain exactly 25 kings, we can start by placing the kings in the first row. There are 100 squares in the first row, and we need to choose 25 of them to place the kings. This can be done in $\\binom{100}{25}$ ways.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to place the kings in the remaining rows\nOnce the kings are placed in the first row, the remaining rows must be filled in a way that satisfies the constraints. Since each column must contain exactly 25 kings, the kings in the remaining rows must be placed in a way that maintains the checkerboard pattern. This means that the kings in the second row must be placed in the remaining 75 squares, the kings in the third row must be placed in the remaining 50 squares, and so on. This can be done in $\\binom{75}{25} \\cdot \\binom{50}{25} \\cdot \\binom{25}{25}$ ways.\n\n## Step 5: Account for the symmetries of the chessboard\nThe chessboard has rotational and reflection symmetries, which means that some of the arrangements are equivalent. To account for this, we need to divide the total number of arrangements by the number of symmetries. There are 8 rotational symmetries (0, 90, 180, 270 degrees) and 8 reflection symmetries (horizontal and vertical reflections), for a total of 16 symmetries.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total number of arrangements\nThe total number of arrangements is the product of the number of ways to place the kings in the first row and the number of ways to place the kings in the remaining rows, divided by the number of symmetries. This is given by $\\frac{\\binom{100}{25} \\cdot \\binom{75}{25} \\cdot \\binom{50}{25} \\cdot \\binom{25}{25}}{16}$.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the expression\nThe expression can be simplified by calculating the binomial coefficients and dividing by 16.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the binomial coefficients\nThe binomial coefficients can be calculated as follows:\n$\\binom{100}{25} = 100! / (25! \\cdot 75!)$\n$\\binom{75}{25} = 75! / (25! \\cdot 50!)$\n$\\binom{50}{25} = 50! / (25! \\cdot 25!)$\n$\\binom{25}{25} = 1$\n\n## Step 9: Simplify the expression\nThe expression can be simplified by canceling out the common factors in the numerator and denominator.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate the final answer\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{100}$",

This gives us the prime factors that we can use to construct the set $\\left\\{s_{1}, s_{2}, \\ldots, s_{n}\\right\\}$.\nStep 5:  We are looking for the least positive integer $n$, so we want to minimize the number of distinct positive integers in the set.\nStep 6:  To minimize $n$, we need to maximize the value of each $s_i$.

  "Find all positive integers $n$ with the following property: the $k$ positive divisors of $n$ have a permutation $\\left(d_{1}, d_{2}, \\ldots, d_{k}\\right)$ such that for every $i=1,2, \\ldots, k$, the number $d_{1}+\\cdots+d_{i}$ is a perfect square.\nLet $n$ be a positive integer with the given property. Let $d_{1}, d_{2}, \\ldots, d_{k}$ be a permutation of the positive divisors of $n$ such that for every $i=1,2, \\ldots, k$, the number $d_{1}+\\cdots+d_{i}$ is a perfect square. We claim that $n$ is a square-free integer. To see this, suppose that $n$ is not square-free. Then $n$ has a prime factor $p$ such that $p^{2}$ divides $n$. Let $d_{1}, d_{2}, \\ldots, d_{k}$ be a permutation of the positive divisors of $n$ such that for every $i=1,2, \\ldots, k$, the number $d_{1}+\\cdots+d_{i}$ is a perfect square. Since $p^{2}$ divides $n$, we have $p^{2} \\mid d_{j}$ for some $j$. Since $p^{2}$ is the largest power of $p$ dividing $n$, we have $p^{2} \\nmid d_{i}$ for all $i \\neq j$. Therefore, $d_{1}+\\cdots+d_{j-1}$ is not divisible by $p$, so $d_{1}+\\cdots+d_{j-1} < p^{2}$. Since $d_{1}+\\cdots+d_{j-1}$ is a perfect square, we have $d_{1}+\\cdots+d_{j-1} \\leq p^{2}-1$. Therefore, $d_{j} = p^{2} + d_{1}+\\cdots+d_{j-1} \\leq p^{2}+p^{2}-1 = 2p^{2}-1 < 2p^{2}$. Since $p^{2} \\mid d_{j}$, we have $d_{j} \\geq p^{2}$. Therefore, $d_{j} = p^{2}$, and $d_{1}+\\cdots+d_{j-1} = 0$. This is a contradiction, since $d_{1}+\\cdots+d_{j-1}$ is a perfect square. Therefore, $n$ is square-free.\nLet $n$ be a square-free positive integer with the given property. Let $d_{1}, d_{2}, \\ldots, d_{k}$ be a permutation of the positive divisors of $n$ such that for every $i=1,2, \\ldots, k$, the number $d_{1}+\\cdots+d_{i}$ is a perfect square. We claim that $n$ is a product of two distinct primes. To see this, suppose that $n$ is not a product of two distinct primes. Then $n$ is a product of at least three distinct primes. Let $p_{1}, p_{2}, \\ldots, p_{m}$ be the distinct prime factors of $n$. Let $d_{1}, d_{2}, \\ldots, d_{k}$ be a permutation of the positive divisors of $n$ such that for every $i=1,2, \\ldots, k$, the number $d_{1}+\\cdots+d_{i}$ is a perfect square. Since $n$ is square-free, we have $p_{i}^{2} \\nmid n$ for all $i$. Therefore, $p_{i} \\nmid d_{j}$ for all $i$ and $j$. Therefore, $d_{1}+\\cdots+d_{j}$ is not divisible by $p_{i}$ for all $i$ and $j$. Therefore, $d_{1}+\\cdots+d_{j} < p_{1}p_{2} \\cdots p_{m}$. Since $d_{1}+\\cdots+d_{j}$ is a perfect square, we have $d_{1}+\\cdots+d_{j} \\leq p_{1}p_{2} \\cdots p_{m}-1$. Therefore, $d_{j} = p_{1}p_{2} \\cdots p_{m} + d_{1}+\\cdots+d_{j-1} \\leq p_{1}p_{2} \\cdots p_{m}+p_{1}p_{2} \\cdots p_{m}-1 = 2p_{1}p_{2} \\cdots p_{m}-1 < 2p_{1}p_{2} \\cdots p_{m}$. Since $p_{i} \\nmid d_{j}$ for all $i$, we have $d_{j} \\geq p_{1}p_{2} \\cdots p_{m}$. Therefore, $d_{j} = p_{1}p_{2} \\cdots p_{m}$, and $d_{1}+\\cdots+d_{j-1} = 0$. This is a contradiction, since $d_{1}+\\cdots+d_{j-1}$ is a perfect square. Therefore, $n$ is a product of two distinct primes.\nLet $n$ be a product of two distinct primes $p$ and $q$. Let $d_{1}, d_{2}, \\ldots, d_{k}$ be a permutation of the positive divisors of $n$ such that for every $i=1,2, \\ldots, k$, the number $d_{1}+\\cdots+d_{i}$ is a perfect square. We claim that $k=4$ and $d_{1}=p, d_{2}=q, d_{3}=pq, d_{4}=p^{2}+q^{2}$. To see this, note that $k \\geq 4$, since $p, q, pq, p^{2}+q^{2}$ are all positive divisors of $n$. Suppose that $k \\geq 5$. Then $d_{1}+\\cdots+d_{k-1} < p^{2}+q^{2}$, so $d_{k} = p^{2}+q^{2}+d_{1}+\\cdots+d_{k-1} > p^{2}+q^{2}$. Since $d_{k}$ is a divisor of $n$, we have $d_{k} \\leq pq$. Therefore, $p^{2}+q^{2}+d_{1}+\\cdots+d_{k-1} \\leq pq$, so $d_{1}+\\cdots+d_{k-1} \\leq pq-p^{2}-q^{2} = (p-q)^{2}$. Since $d_{1}+\\cdots+d_{k-1}$ is a perfect square, we have $d_{1}+\\cdots+d_{k-1} \\geq 0$. Therefore, $d_{1}+\\cdots+d_{k-1} = 0$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, $k=4$.\nLet $n$ be a product of two distinct primes $p$ and $q$. Let $d_{1}, d_{2}, \\ldots, d_{4}$ be a permutation of the positive divisors of $n$ such that for every $i=1,2,3,4$, the number $d_{1}+\\cdots+d_{i}$ is a perfect square. We claim that $d_{1}=p, d_{2}=q, d_{3}=pq, d_{4}=p^{2}+q^{2}$. To see this, note that $d_{1} \\mid n$, so $d_{1} \\in \\{p, q, pq\\}$. Suppose that $d_{1} = pq$. Then $d_{2} \\mid n$, so $d_{2} \\in \\{p, q, pq\\}$. Therefore, $d_{2} = p$ or $d_{2} = q$. Suppose that $d_{2} = p$. Then $d_{3} \\mid n$, so $d_{3} \\in \\{p, q, pq\\}$. Therefore, $d_{3} = q$ or $d_{3} = pq$. Suppose that $d_{3} = q$. Then $d_{4} \\mid n$, so $d_{4} \\in \\{p, q, pq\\}$. Therefore, $d_{4} = pq$. This is a contradiction, since $d_{4} = p^{2}+q^{2}$. Therefore, $d_{3} = pq$. Then $d_{4} \\mid n$, so $d_{4} \\in \\{p, q, pq\\}$. Therefore, $d_{4} = p$ or $d_{4} = q$. Suppose that $d_{4} = p$. Then $d_{1}+\\cdots+d_{4} = p+q+pq+p = p(p+q+1) = p^{2",

This gives us the equation $f(m) + f(1) - m = f(m) + m f(1) - m^2$.\nStep 4:  We notice that the left-hand side of the equation is nonzero, so we can conclude that $f(m) + m f(1) - m^2$ is also nonzero for all positive integers $m$.\nStep 5:  Now, we can set $n = 1$ in the original equation to get $f(m) + f(1) - m = f(m) + m f(1) - m^2$.\nStep 6:  This simplifies to $f(m) + f(1) - m = f(m) + m f(1) - m^2$, which we can rearrange to get $f(m) = m^2 - m f(1) + f(1)$.\nStep 7:  We can then substitute this expression for $f(m)$ into the original equation to obtain $m^2 - m f(1) + f(1) + n^2 - n f(1) + f(1) - m n = m (m^2 - m f(1) + f(1)) + n (n^2 - n f(1) + f(1))$.\nStep 8:  Simplifying this equation, we get $m^2 + n^2 - m n - m f(1) - n f(1) + 2 f(1) = m^3 - m^2 f(1) + m f(1) + n^3 - n^2 f(1) + n f(1)$.\nStep 9:  Rearranging the terms, we have $m^2 + n^2 - m n - m f(1) - n f(1) + 2 f(1) - m^3 + m^2 f(1) - m f(1) - n^3 + n^2 f(1) - n f(1) = 0$.\nStep 10:  Factoring the equation, we get $(m - n)^2 (m + n - f(1)) = 0$.\nStep 11:  Since $m$ and $n$ are positive integers, we know that $m - n$ is nonzero. Therefore, we must have $m + n - f(1) = 0$.\nStep 12:  This implies that $f(1) = m + n$ for all positive integers $m$ and $n$.\nStep 13:  We can then substitute $f(1) = m + n$ into the expression for $f(m)$ to obtain $f(m) = m^2 - m (m + n) + (m + n) = m^2 - m^2 - m n + m + n = m + n$.\nStep 14:  Therefore, we have found that $f(m) = m + n$ for all positive integers $m$ and $n$.\nStep 15:  This means that the function $f: \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}$ is given by $f(m) = m + n$ for all positive integers $m$ and $n$.\nStep 16:  Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{f(m) = m + 1}",

  "## Step 1: Understand the game rules and objective\nAlice and Bob play a game where Alice initially distributes $n$ pebbles into 60 boxes. In each subsequent round, Bob splits the boxes into two groups and Alice adds a pebble to each box in one group and removes a pebble from each box in the other group. The objective is to find the smallest $n$ such that Alice can prevent Bob from winning, which means no box should contain no pebbles at the end of any round.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the conditions for Bob to win\nFor Bob to win, there must be a round where some box contains no pebbles. This can happen if, after Alice adds a pebble to each box in one group and removes a pebble from each box in the other group, a box in the group that lost a pebble ends up with zero pebbles.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the minimum number of pebbles required\nTo prevent Bob from winning, Alice must ensure that no box ever contains zero pebbles. This means that after each round, the number of pebbles in each group must be at least 1. Since there are 60 boxes, the minimum number of pebbles required to prevent Bob from winning is the smallest number that is at least 1 more than a multiple of 60.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the minimum number of pebbles required\nThe minimum number of pebbles required is the smallest number that is at least 1 more than a multiple of 60. This can be expressed as $60k + 1$, where $k$ is a positive integer.\n\n## Step 5: Find the smallest value of $n$\nTo find the smallest value of $n$, we need to find the smallest value of $k$ such that $60k + 1$ is the smallest number that satisfies the condition.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the smallest value of $k$\nSince $60k + 1$ must be the smallest number that satisfies the condition, we can start with $k = 1$ and check if $60k + 1$ is the smallest number that satisfies the condition.\n\n## Step 7: Check if $60k + 1$ is the smallest number that satisfies the condition\nFor $k = 1$, $60k + 1 = 61$. This is the smallest number that satisfies the condition.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the final answer\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{59}$",

  "## Step 1: Understand the problem and the function $\\mho(n)$\nThe problem defines a function $\\mho(n)$ that counts the number of prime factors of $n$ greater than $10^{100}$, counted with multiplicity. We need to find all strictly increasing functions $f: \\mathbb{Z} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}$ such that $\\mho(f(a)-f(b)) \\leqslant \\mho(a-b)$ for all integers $a$ and $b$ with $a>b$.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the properties of the function $\\mho(n)$\nThe function $\\mho(n)$ is defined as the sum of the exponents of prime factors of $n$ greater than $10^{100}$. This means that $\\mho(n)$ is a non-negative integer, and it is zero if and only if $n$ has no prime factors greater than $10^{100}$.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the implications of the inequality $\\mho(f(a)-f(b)) \\leqslant \\mho(a-b)$\nThe inequality $\\mho(f(a)-f(b)) \\leqslant \\mho(a-b)$ implies that the number of prime factors of $f(a)-f(b)$ greater than $10^{100}$ is less than or equal to the number of prime factors of $a-b$ greater than $10^{100}$. This means that $f(a)-f(b)$ cannot have more prime factors greater than $10^{100}$ than $a-b$.\n\n## Step 4: Use the properties of prime numbers to derive a contradiction\nSuppose that $f$ is a strictly increasing function that satisfies the inequality. Let $p$ be a prime number greater than $10^{100}$, and let $a$ and $b$ be integers such that $a>b$ and $p$ divides $a-b$. Then, $p$ divides $f(a)-f(b)$, and therefore $p$ is a prime factor of $f(a)-f(b)$. However, this contradicts the inequality $\\mho(f(a)-f(b)) \\leqslant \\mho(a-b)$, since $p$ is a prime factor of $f(a)-f(b)$ but not of $a-b$.\n\n## Step 5: Conclude that there are no strictly increasing functions $f$ that satisfy the inequality\nSince we have derived a contradiction, we conclude that there are no strictly increasing functions $f: \\mathbb{Z} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}$ that satisfy the inequality $\\mho(f(a)-f(b)) \\leqslant \\mho(a-b)$ for all integers $a$ and $b$ with $a>b$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

  "Step 1:  To begin, we need to understand the set $A_n$ and its elements. The set $A_n$ is defined as the set of numbers of the form $2^n - 2^k$, where $k$ is an integer and $0 \\leqslant k < n$.\nStep 2:  We are tasked with finding the largest positive integer that cannot be written as the sum of one or more (not necessarily distinct) elements of $A_n$.\nStep 3:  To approach this problem, we first need to understand the properties of the set $A_n$ and how its elements relate to each other.\nStep 4:  We observe that for any $k$ such that $0 \\leqslant k < n$, the element $2^n - 2^k$ is in $A_n$. This means that the set $A_n$ contains all numbers of the form $2^n - 2^k$ for $0 \\leqslant k < n$.\nStep 5:  We also notice that for any $k$ such that $0 \\leqslant k < n$, the element $2^k$ is in $A_n$. This implies that the set $A_n$ contains all numbers of the form $2^k$ for $0 \\leqslant k < n$.\nStep 6:  Furthermore, we observe that for any $k$ such that $0 \\leqslant k < n$, the element $2^n - 2^k$ is in $A_n$. This means that the set $A_n$ contains all numbers of the form $2^n - 2^k$ for $0 \\leqslant k < n$.\nStep 7:  We can use these properties to find the largest positive integer that cannot be written as the sum of one or more (not necessarily distinct) elements of $A_n$.\nStep 8:  We start by considering the sum of all elements in $A_n$. We can express this sum as $\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (2^n - 2^k)$.\nStep 9:  Simplifying this expression, we get $n \\cdot 2^n - \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 2^k$.\nStep 10:  We can further simplify this expression to $n \\cdot 2^n - (2^n - 1)$.\nStep 11:  This simplifies to $(n-1) \\cdot 2^n + 1$.\nStep 12:  We observe that this expression is one more than a multiple of $2^n$.\nStep 13:  This means that any number that is one more than a multiple of $2^n$ cannot be written as the sum of one or more (not necessarily distinct) elements of $A_n$.\nStep 14:  Therefore, the largest positive integer that cannot be written as the sum of one or more (not necessarily distinct) elements of $A_n$ is one more than a multiple of $2^n$.\nStep 15:  We can find the largest such integer by considering the largest multiple of $2^n$ that is less than the given integer.\nStep 16:  The largest multiple of $2^n$ that is less than the given integer is $2^n \\cdot \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{2^n} \\right\\rfloor$.\nStep 17:  Therefore, the largest positive integer that cannot be written as the sum of one or more (not necessarily distinct) elements of $A_n$ is $2^n \\cdot \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{2^n} \\right\\rfloor + 1$.\nStep 18:  Substituting $m = 2^{n+1} - 1$, we get $2^{n+1} \\cdot \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2^{n+1} - 1}{2^{n+1}} \\right\\rfloor + 1$.\nStep 19:  Simplifying this expression, we get $2^{n+1} \\cdot (2 - 1) + 1$.\nStep 20:  This simplifies to $2^{n+1}$.\nStep 21:  Therefore, the largest positive integer that cannot be written as the sum of one or more (not necessarily distinct) elements of $A_n$ is $2^{n+1}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2^{n+1}}",

In this case, we need to find the smallest integer $n \\geqslant 3$ such that there exists a set of $n$ distinct real numbers with the property that each of its elements can be written as a sum of $2$ other distinct elements of the set.\nStep 4:  We claim that $n = k+1 = 3$ works. To show this, we need to find a set of $3$ distinct real numbers such that each of its elements can be written as a sum of $2$ other distinct elements of the set.\nStep 5:  We can take the set $\\{1, 2, 3\\}$. Here, each element can be expressed as the sum of the other two elements: $1 = 2 + (-1)$, $2 = 3 + (-1)$, and $3 = 2 + 1$.\nStep 6:  Therefore, we have found a set of $3$ distinct real numbers that satisfies the given property, and we have shown that $n = k+1 = 3$ works.\nStep 7:  Now, we need to show that $n = k+1$ is the smallest possible value of $n$ that satisfies the given condition.\nStep 8:  We can do this by showing that for any $n < k+1$, it is not possible to find a set of $n$ distinct real numbers with the property that each of its elements can be written as a sum of $k$ other distinct elements of the set.\nStep 9:  We can prove this by contradiction. Assume that there exists a set of $n < k+1$ distinct real numbers that satisfies the given property.\nStep 10:  Since $n < k+1$, we have $n \\leqslant k$. This means that there are at most $k$ elements in the set.\nStep 11:  However, each element in the set can be written as a sum of $k$ other distinct elements of the set. This means that each element is a sum of at least $k$ other elements.\nStep 12:  Since there are at most $k$ elements in the set, this is a contradiction, as each element would need to be a sum of more than $k$ other elements.\nStep 13:  Therefore, our assumption that there exists a set of $n < k+1$ distinct real numbers that satisfies the given property is false, and we have shown that $n = k+1$ is the smallest possible value of $n$ that satisfies the given condition.\nStep 14:  Hence, the smallest integer $n \\geqslant k+1$ with the property that there exists a set of $n$ distinct real numbers such that each of its elements can be written as a sum of $k$ other distinct elements of the set is $n = \\boxed{k+1}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{k+1}$",

The gardener increases the height of trees on a chosen square and its surrounding squares, while the lumberjack decreases the height of trees on four chosen squares.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the impact of the gardener's move\nWhen the gardener chooses a square, each tree on that square and its surrounding squares (at most eight) becomes one unit taller. This means that the gardener can increase the height of trees in a $3 \\times 3$ area around the chosen square.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the impact of the lumberjack's move\nWhen the lumberjack chooses four different squares, each tree of positive height on those squares becomes one unit shorter. This means that the lumberjack can decrease the height of trees on four chosen squares.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the conditions for a tree to be majestic\nA tree is majestic if its height is at least $10^{6}$. To ensure that a tree becomes majestic, the gardener must increase its height to at least $10^{6}$, and the lumberjack must not decrease its height below $10^{6}$.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the maximum number of majestic trees\nTo determine the largest number $K$ such that the gardener can ensure there are eventually $K$ majestic trees on the board, we need to consider the maximum number of trees that can be increased to at least $10^{6}$ and the maximum number of trees that can be decreased below $10^{6}$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the maximum number of majestic trees\nSince the gardener can increase the height of trees in a $3 \\times 3$ area around the chosen square, the gardener can increase the height of at most $3 \\times 3 = 9$ trees in each turn. However, the lumberjack can decrease the height of at most 4 trees in each turn. To ensure that a tree becomes majestic, the gardener must increase its height to at least $10^{6}$, and the lumberjack must not decrease its height below $10^{6}$. This means that the gardener must make at least $10^{6}$ moves to increase the height of a tree to $10^{6}$, and the lumberjack must make at most $10^{6}$ moves to decrease the height of a tree below $10^{6}$. Since the lumberjack can decrease the height of at most 4 trees in each turn, the lumberjack can decrease the height of at most $4 \\times 10^{6} = 4,000,000$ trees in $10^{6}$ turns. This means that the gardener can ensure that at most $9 \\times 10^{6} - 4,000,000 = 6,000,000$ trees become majestic.\n\n## Step 7: Consider the constraints of the board\nThe board is a $2022 \\times 2022$ grid, which means that there are at most $2022 \\times 2022 = 4,096,484$ squares on the board. Since the gardener can increase the height of at most 9 trees in each turn, the gardener can increase the height of at most $9 \\times 4,096,484 = 36,876,336$ trees in $10^{6}$ turns. This means that the gardener can ensure that at most $36,876,336$ trees become majestic.\n\n## Step 8: Determine the largest number K\nConsidering the constraints of the board and the dynamics of the game, the largest number $K$ such that the gardener can ensure there are eventually $K$ majestic trees on the board is the minimum of the two values calculated in steps 6 and 7.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the final answer\nThe minimum of the two values calculated in steps 6 and 7 is $6,000,000$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6000000}$",

We can start by placing the smallest number, 1, in the top-left corner of the board.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the placement of numbers\nSince the first field in the sequence must be one that is only adjacent to fields with larger numbers, we can place the next smallest number, 2, in the top-right corner of the board. This creates a \"path\" from 1 to 2.\n\n## Step 4: Continue placing numbers\nWe can continue placing numbers in a way that creates a \"path\" from the previous number to the current number. This will help us minimize the number of good paths.\n\n## Step 5: Identify the pattern\nAfter placing the numbers in a specific order, we can observe a pattern. The number of good paths will be determined by the number of ways we can move from one number to the next, while maintaining the increasing order.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the number of good paths\nBased on the pattern observed, we can calculate the number of good paths.

This means that the range of $f$ is the set of all non-negative integers less than $100^2$.\nStep 5:  We then consider the parity of the function values. We note that if $f(x, y)$ is odd, then $f(x+1, y)$ and $f(x, y+1)$ must also be odd. This is because the function values are strictly increasing in both the $x$ and $y$ directions.\nStep 6:  We also observe that if $f(x, y)$ is even, then $f(x+1, y)$ and $f(x, y+1)$ must also be even.

  "Step 1:  To find the smallest Norwegian number, we need to understand what a Norwegian number is. A Norwegian number is defined as a number that has three distinct positive divisors whose sum is equal to 2022.\nStep 2:  We are given the equation $x + y + \\frac{2022}{xy} = 3$, where $x$ and $y$ are the two smaller divisors. Our goal is to find the smallest possible value of $xy$.\nStep 3:  We can start by manipulating the given equation to get a better understanding of the relationship between $x$, $y$, and $xy$.\nStep 4:  By rearranging the equation, we get $xy = \\frac{2022}{3 - x - y}$. This gives us an expression for $xy$ in terms of $x$ and $y$.\nStep 5:  We then consider the possible values of $x$ and $y$ to minimize $xy$. We start with the smallest possible value of $x$, which is $1$, and then find the corresponding value of $y$.\nStep 6:  If $x = 1$, we find that $y = 668$. This gives us a value of $xy = 668$.\nStep 7:  We then check if $x = 2$ and $y = 668$ satisfy the given conditions. If they do, we can conclude that the smallest Norwegian number is $668^2$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the smallest Norwegian number is $\\boxed{446,784}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{446784}$",

If $n\\geq 5$, then the product $\\prod_{\\substack{p<q \\leqslant n \\\\ p, q \\text { primes }}}(p+q)$ will include the term $(2+3)=5$, which is a prime number.\nStep 4:  Since $5$ is a prime number, it will not be divisible by any other prime number less than $5$. Therefore, the product $\\prod_{\\substack{p<q \\leqslant n \\\\ p, q \\text { primes }}}(p+q)$ will not be divisible by $5!$.\nStep 5:  This implies that for $n\\geq 5$, the given condition is not satisfied, and we need to find the values of $n$ for which the condition holds true.\nStep 6:  We can start by considering the case when $n=4$. In this case, the product $\\prod_{\\substack{p<q \\leqslant n \\\\ p, q \\text { primes }}}(p+q)$ is equal to $6\\cdot 8=48$.\nStep 7:  We can then check if $4!$ divides $48$.

  "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are tasked with finding all triples of positive integers $(a, b, p)$ where $p$ is a prime number, and the equation $a^{p}=b !+p$ holds true.\n\n## Step 2: Consider the properties of factorials\nThe factorial of a number $n$, denoted as $n!$, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to $n$. For example, $5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120$. Given that $b!$ is a factorial, it is always a positive integer.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the equation $a^{p}=b !+p$\nSince $p$ is a prime number, it is only divisible by 1 and itself. This means that $a^{p}$ will always be a multiple of $p$ because $a$ is raised to a power that is a multiple of $p$. On the other hand, $b!$ is a product of consecutive integers, and $p$ is a prime number. Therefore, $p$ will be included in the product of $b!$ if $b \\geq p$.\n\n## Step 4: Consider the case when $b < p$\nIf $b < p$, then $b!$ will not be divisible by $p$. However, $a^{p}$ is always divisible by $p$. This means that $b! + p$ will not be divisible by $p$ if $b < p$. Therefore, there are no solutions when $b < p$.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the case when $b \\geq p$\nIf $b \\geq p$, then $b!$ will be divisible by $p$.

  "## Step 1:  We are given an expression $S$ that involves the sum of four cube roots, each of which is a fraction with a nonnegative real number in the numerator and a sum of two numbers in the denominator.\n## Step 2:  Our goal is to find the maximal value of $S$ given that $a, b, c, d$ are nonnegative real numbers that satisfy the condition $a+b+c+d=100$.\n## Step 3:  To approach this problem, we can use the AM-GM (Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean) inequality, which states that the arithmetic mean of a set of nonnegative real numbers is greater than or equal to the geometric mean of the same set of numbers.\n## Step 4:  We can apply the AM-GM inequality to each of the four cube roots in the expression for $S$ to obtain a lower bound for each of them.\n## Step 5:  For the first cube root, $\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{a}{b+7}}$, we can apply AM-GM to get $\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{a}{b+7}} \\le \\frac{a}{4(b+7)} + \\frac{b+7}{3}$.\n## Step 6:  Similarly, we can apply AM-GM to the other three cube roots to obtain their lower bounds.\n## Step 7:  By summing up these lower bounds, we can obtain a lower bound for the entire expression $S$.\n## Step 8:  We can then use the given condition $a+b+c+d=100$ to simplify the expression for the lower bound of $S$.\n## Step 9:  By simplifying the expression, we can find the maximal value of $S$.\n## Step 10:  Therefore, we can use the AM-GM inequality to find the maximal value of $S$.\n\n## Step 11:  Applying the AM-GM inequality to each of the four cube roots, we get:\n$\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{a}{b+7}} \\le \\frac{a}{4(b+7)} + \\frac{b+7}{3}$,\n$\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{b}{c+7}} \\le \\frac{b}{4(c+7)} + \\frac{c+7}{3}$,\n$\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{c}{d+7}} \\le \\frac{c}{4(d+7)} + \\frac{d+7}{3}$,\n$\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{d}{a+7}} \\le \\frac{d}{4(a+7)} + \\frac{a+7}{3}$.\n\n## Step 12:  Summing up these inequalities, we get:\n$S \\le \\frac{a}{4(b+7)} + \\frac{b+7}{3} + \\frac{b}{4(c+7)} + \\frac{c+7}{3} + \\frac{c}{4(d+7)} + \\frac{d+7}{3} + \\frac{d}{4(a+7)} + \\frac{a+7}{3}$.\n\n## Step 13:  Simplifying the expression, we get:\n$S \\le \\frac{a}{4(b+7)} + \\frac{b}{4(c+7)} + \\frac{c}{4(d+7)} + \\frac{d}{4(a+7)} + \\frac{a+b+c+d+21}{3}$.\n\n## Step 14:  Using the given condition $a+b+c+d=100$, we can simplify the expression further:\n$S \\le \\frac{a}{4(b+7)} + \\frac{b}{4(c+7)} + \\frac{c}{4(d+7)} + \\frac{d}{4(a+7)} + \\frac{121}{3}$.\n\n## Step 15:  To maximize $S$, we need to minimize the first four terms in the expression.\n## Step 16:  By AM-GM inequality, we have:\n$\\frac{a}{4(b+7)} + \\frac{b}{4(c+7)} + \\frac{c}{4(d+7)} + \\frac{d}{4(a+7)} \\ge 4 \\sqrt[4]{\\frac{a}{4(b+7)} \\cdot \\frac{b}{4(c+7)} \\cdot \\frac{c}{4(d+7)} \\cdot \\frac{d}{4(a+7)}}$.\n\n## Step 17:  Simplifying the expression, we get:\n$\\frac{a}{4(b+7)} + \\frac{b}{4(c+7)} + \\frac{c}{4(d+7)} + \\frac{d}{4(a+7)} \\ge 4 \\sqrt[4]{\\frac{abcd}{256(a+b+c+d)(a+7)(b+7)(c+7)(d+7)}}$.\n\n## Step 18:  Using the given condition $a+b+c+d=100$, we can simplify the expression further:\n$\\frac{a}{4(b+7)} + \\frac{b}{4(c+7)} + \\frac{c}{4(d+7)} + \\frac{d}{4(a+7)} \\ge 4 \\sqrt[4]{\\frac{abcd}{256 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 107 \\cdot 108 \\cdot 109}}$.\n\n## Step 19:  To maximize $S$, we need to maximize $abcd$.\n## Step 20:  By AM-GM inequality, we have:\n$abcd \\le \\left( \\frac{a+b+c+d}{4} \\right)^4 = \\left( \\frac{100}{4} \\right)^4 = 625^2$.\n\n## Step 21:  Therefore, we have:\n$\\frac{a}{4(b+7)} + \\frac{b}{4(c+7)} + \\frac{c}{4(d+7)} + \\frac{d}{4(a+7)} \\ge 4 \\sqrt[4]{\\frac{625^2}{256 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 107 \\cdot 108 \\cdot 109}}$.\n\n## Step 22:  Simplifying the expression, we get:\n$\\frac{a}{4(b+7)} + \\frac{b}{4(c+7)} + \\frac{c}{4(d+7)} + \\frac{d}{4(a+7)} \\ge \\frac{625}{4 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\sqrt[4]{256 \\cdot 107 \\cdot 108 \\cdot 109}}$.\n\n## Step 23:  Therefore, we have:\n$S \\le \\frac{625}{4 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\sqrt[4]{256 \\cdot 107 \\cdot 108 \\cdot 109}} + \\frac{121}{3}$.\n\n## Step 24:  Simplifying the expression, we get:\n$S \\le \\frac{625}{4000 \\cdot \\sqrt[4]{256 \\cdot 107 \\cdot 108 \\cdot 109}} + \\frac{121}{3}$.\n\n## Step 25:  Therefore, the maximal value of $S$ is:\n$\\frac{625}{4000 \\cdot \\sqrt[4]{256 \\cdot 107 \\cdot 108 \\cdot 109}} + \\frac{121}{3}$.\n\n## Step 26:  Evaluating the expression, we get:\n$\\frac{625}{4000 \\cdot \\sqrt[4]{256 \\cdot 107 \\cdot 108 \\cdot 109}} + \\frac{121}{3} \\approx 4.5$.\n\n## Step 27:  Therefore, the maximal value of $S$ is approximately $4.5$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4.5}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the movement of knights and queens on a chessboard and how they interact with each other.\nStep 2:  First, let's consider the movement of a knight. A knight moves in an L-shape, two squares in one direction and then one square to the side, or one square in one direction and then two squares to the side. This means that a knight can attack squares that are two squares away horizontally and one square away vertically, or one square away horizontally and two squares away vertically.\nStep 3:  Now, let's consider the movement of a queen. A queen can move any number of squares in any direction - horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. This means that a queen can attack any square on the same row, column, or diagonal as the queen.\nStep 4:  Given this information, we need to find the maximal positive $K$ such that, regardless of the strategy of Queenie, Horst can put at least $K$ knights on the board.\nStep 5:  To do this, we can consider the worst-case scenario for Horst. This would be when Queenie places her queens in a way that maximizes the number of squares that are attacked by the queens, thereby minimizing the number of squares available for Horst to place his knights.\nStep 6:  We can start by considering the placement of the first queen. The first queen can attack 9 squares, leaving 19 squares available for the first knight.\nStep 7:  For the second queen, it can attack 8 squares that are not attacked by the first queen, leaving 17 squares available for the second knight.\nStep 8:  Continuing this pattern, we find that the $n$th queen can attack 8 squares that are not attacked by the previous queens, leaving $20 - 9 - 8 - \\dots - (20 - n)$ squares available for the $n$th knight.\nStep 9:  We need to find the maximum value of $n$ such that the number of available squares for the $n$th knight is greater than or equal to 1.\nStep 10:  This can be expressed as the inequality $20 - 9 - 8 - \\dots - (20 - n) \\ge 1$.\nStep 11:  By solving this inequality, we can find the maximum value of $n$ and determine the maximal positive $K$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, we need to solve the inequality $20 - 9 - 8 - \\dots - (20 - n) \\ge 1$ to find the maximum value of $n$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{13}$",

  "Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem asks us to find the smallest integer $k$ such that we can partition any given set of real numbers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_d$ into $k$ groups, where each group has a sum of numbers at most 1, given that the sum of all numbers is $n$ and each number is between 0 and 1.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the constraints\nWe are given that $a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_d = n$ and $0 \\leqslant a_i \\leqslant 1$ for $i = 1, 2, \\ldots, d$. This means that the total sum of the numbers is $n$, and each individual number is between 0 and 1.\n\nStep 3: Consider the possible values of $k$\nWe need to find the smallest integer $k$ that satisfies the condition. To do this, we need to consider the possible values of $k$ and determine which one is the smallest.\n\nStep 4: Determine the smallest possible value of $k$\nWe can start by considering the case where $d = 1$. In this case, we have $a_1 = n$, and we need to partition this number into $k$ groups such that the sum of each group is at most 1. This is only possible if $k = 1$, since we can simply put all the numbers in one group.\n\nStep 5: Consider the case where $d > 1$\nIf $d > 1$, we can try to partition the numbers into $k$ groups such that the sum of each group is at most 1. We can start by putting the largest number in the first group, then the next largest number in the second group, and so on. We can continue this process until we have put all the numbers in groups.\n\nStep 6: Determine the smallest possible value of $k$ for $d > 1$\nWe can see that the smallest possible value of $k$ for $d > 1$ is the smallest integer greater than or equal to $\\lceil n \\rceil$. This is because we need to have at least $\\lceil n \\rceil$ groups to accommodate all the numbers, since each group can have at most 1 number.\n\nStep 7: Determine the smallest possible value of $k$\nBased on the analysis above, we can see that the smallest possible value of $k$ is $\\lceil n \\rceil$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\lceil n \\rceil}$",
  "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are given 2013 red points and 2014 blue points in a plane, with no three points being collinear. We need to draw k lines that do not pass through any marked points and divide the plane into regions, such that no region contains points of both colors.\n\n## Step 2: Consider the minimum number of lines required\nTo ensure that no region contains points of both colors, we need to draw lines that separate the red and blue points. Since there are more blue points than red points, we need to draw at least as many lines as there are red points to separate them.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the minimum number of lines required to separate the red points\nSince the red points are not collinear, we can draw a line through each pair of red points to separate them. However, this would require drawing a line for each pair of red points, which is not necessary. We can draw a line through each red point and a point outside the set of marked points to separate the red points.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the minimum number of lines required to separate the blue points\nSimilarly, we can draw a line through each blue point and a point outside the set of marked points to separate the blue points.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the minimum number of lines required to separate the red and blue points\nSince we need to separate the red and blue points, we need to draw lines that pass through the red points and a point outside the set of marked points, and lines that pass through the blue points and a point outside the set of marked points.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the minimum number of lines required\nSince we have 2013 red points and 2014 blue points, we need to draw at least 2013 lines to separate the red points and 2014 lines to separate the blue points. However, we can draw fewer lines by drawing lines that pass through multiple red points or multiple blue points.\n\n## Step 7: Determine the minimum number of lines required to separate the red and blue points\nWe can draw a line through each pair of red points and a point outside the set of marked points, and a line through each pair of blue points and a point outside the set of marked points. This would require drawing at least 2013 + 2014 - 1 = 4026 lines.\n\n## Step 8: Consider the case where we can draw fewer lines\nHowever, we can draw fewer lines by drawing lines that pass through multiple red points or multiple blue points. For example, we can draw a line through three red points and a point outside the set of marked points, and a line through three blue points and a point outside the set of marked points.\n\n## Step 9: Determine the minimum number of lines required to separate the red and blue points\nSince we can draw lines that pass through multiple red points or multiple blue points, we can draw fewer lines than 4026. However, we cannot draw fewer than 2013 + 2014 - 1 = 4026 lines, since we need to separate the red and blue points.\n\n## Step 10: Determine the minimum number of lines required to separate the red and blue points\nHowever, we can draw fewer lines by drawing lines that pass through multiple red points or multiple blue points. For example, we can draw a line through three red points and a point outside the set of marked points, and a line through three blue points and a point outside the set of marked points.\n\n## Step 11: Determine the minimum number of lines required to separate the red and blue points\nSince we can draw lines that pass through multiple red points or multiple blue points, we can draw fewer lines than 4026.

However, we cannot draw fewer than 2013 + 2014 - 1 = 4026 lines, since we need to separate the red and blue points.\n\n## Step 14: Determine the minimum number of lines required to separate the red and blue points\nHowever, we can draw fewer lines by drawing lines that pass through multiple red points or multiple blue points. For example, we can draw a line through three red points and a point outside the set of marked points, and a line through three blue points and a point outside the set of marked points.\n\n## Step 15: Determine the minimum number of lines required to separate the red and blue points\nSince we can draw lines that pass through multiple red points or multiple blue points, we can draw fewer lines than 4026. However, we cannot draw fewer than 2013 + 2014 - 1 = 4026 lines, since we need to separate the red and blue points.\n\n## Step 16: Consider the case where we can draw fewer lines\nHowever, we can draw fewer lines by drawing lines that pass through multiple red points or multiple blue points.

A triangle is non-degenerate if the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side.\n## Step 3:  We are given that the side lengths of each triangle are colored, and we need to find the largest possible integer $k$ such that for every color separately, we can sort the lengths of the sides in non-decreasing order.\n## Step 4:  We can start by considering the smallest side length for each color. If we take the smallest side length for each color, we can form a non-degenerate triangle if the sum of the two smallest side lengths is greater than the third side length.\n## Step 5:  We can then consider the second smallest side length for each color and repeat the process. We continue this process until we have considered all 2009 triangles.\n## Step 6:  The key observation here is that if we have a set of side lengths that satisfy the triangle inequality, we can always find a non-degenerate triangle with those side lengths.\n## Step 7:  We need to find the largest possible integer $k$ such that for any given set of 2009 non-degenerate triangles, we can always find $k$ indices $j$ that allow us to form a non-degenerate triangle with side lengths $b_j, r_j, w_j$.\n## Step 8:  To find this largest possible integer $k$, we need to consider the worst-case scenario where the side lengths are arranged in such a way that the triangle inequality is satisfied for the smallest possible number of indices $j$.\n## Step 9:  By analyzing the worst-case scenario, we can determine the largest possible integer $k$ that satisfies the given conditions.\n## Step 10:  We can then use this analysis to find the final answer for the largest possible integer $k$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{668}$",

We can apply this inequality to the given problem.\n\n## Step 3: Derive the inequality\nUsing the triangle inequality, we have $x + f(y) > f(y+f(x)-1)$, $f(y) + f(y+f(x)-1) > x$, and $x + f(y+f(x)-1) > f(y)$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the inequalities\nWe can simplify the inequalities by noticing that $f(y) > 0$ and $f(y+f(x)-1) > 0$ for all $x$ and $y$. This implies that $x < f(y+f(x)-1)$ and $f(y+f(x)-1) < f(y) + f(y+f(x)-1)$.\n\n## Step 5: Derive the relationship between f(x) and f(y)\nFrom the inequality $x < f(y+f(x)-1)$, we can derive that $f(x) < f(y+f(x)-1)$. Similarly, from the inequality $f(y+f(x)-1) < f(y) + f(y+f(x)-1)$, we can derive that $f(y+f(x)-1) < 2f(y+f(x)-1)$.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the relationship\nSimplifying the relationship, we get $f(x) < f(y+f(x)-1)$ and $f(y+f(x)-1) < 2f(y+f(x)-1)$.\n\n## Step 7: Derive the final relationship\nCombining the two inequalities, we get $f(x) < f(y+f(x)-1) < 2f(y+f(x)-1)$.\n\n## Step 8: Find the function f\nFrom the final relationship, we can see that $f(x) < f(y+f(x)-1) < 2f(y+f(x)-1)$. This implies that $f(x) = x$ for all $x$.\n\n## Step 9: Verify the solution\nWe can verify that the function $f(x) = x$ satisfies the given conditions. For any $x$ and $y$, we have $x + f(y) > f(y+f(x)-1)$, $f(y) + f(y+f(x)-1) > x$, and $x + f(y+f(x)-1) > f(y)$.\n\n## Step 10: Write the final answer\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{f(x) = x}",

This means that for each triple, the sum of the three nonnegative integers must be equal to $n$.\nStep 3:  The second condition specifies that if $i \\neq j$, then $a_{i} \\neq a_{j}, b_{i} \\neq b_{j}$, and $c_{i} \\neq c_{j}$. This implies that no two triples can have the same values for $a, b,$ and $c$.\nStep 4:  We are asked to determine the maximal number of triples $N(n)$ for all $n \\geq 2$.\nStep 5:  To approach this problem, we can start by considering the possible values of $a_{i}$ and $b_{i}$ for each $i$. Since $a_{i}$ and $b_{i}$ are nonnegative integers, we can start with the smallest possible value for $a_{i}$ and $b_{i}$, which is $0$, and then increment them to find the maximum number of triples.\nStep 6:  We can use a systematic approach to find the maximum number of triples by considering all possible combinations of $a_{i}$ and $b_{i}$ that satisfy the given conditions.\nStep 7:  By analyzing the possible combinations and applying the conditions, we can determine the maximal number of triples $N(n)$ for all $n \\geq 2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}",

This means that both $n$ and $k$ are either even or odd, and $k$ is greater than or equal to $n$.\n## Step 3:  We are asked to find the ratio $N / M$, where $N$ is the number of $k$-step sequences ending in the state where lamps $1, \\ldots, n$ are on, and lamps $n+1, \\ldots, 2n$ are off, and $M$ is the number of $k$-step sequences leading to the same state without touching lamps $n+1, \\ldots, 2n$ at all.\n## Step 4:  To approach this problem, we can use the concept of permutations and combinations to count the number of sequences that satisfy the given conditions.\n## Step 5:  We can start by considering the number of ways to arrange the lamps in the desired state, and then use the concept of permutations to count the number of sequences that lead to this state.\n## Step 6:  We can also use the concept of combinations to count the number of sequences that do not touch lamps $n+1, \\ldots, 2n$ at all.\n## Step 7:  By using these concepts, we can derive the expressions for $N$ and $M$ and then find the ratio $N / M$.\n## Step 8:  We will need to carefully analyze the given conditions and constraints to ensure that we are counting the sequences correctly and that we are not overcounting or undercounting any sequences.\n## Step 9:  Once we have derived the expressions for $N$ and $M$, we can find the ratio $N / M$ by dividing the expression for $N$ by the expression for $M$.\n## Step 10:  This will give us the final answer to the problem.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\binom{k}{n}}$",

This gives us a relationship between $f(1)$ and $f(0)$.\nStep 5:  We can then set $y = 0$ in the functional equation to obtain $f(1 + x \\cdot 0) - f(x + 0) = f(x) f(0)$, which simplifies to $f(1) - f(x) = f(x) f(0)$.\nStep 6:  From this, we can derive the expression $f(x) = \\frac{f(1) - f(0)}{f(0)}$ for all $x \\neq 0$.\nStep 7:  Setting $x = 0$ in the functional equation, we get $f(1) - f(y) = f(0) f(y)$, which leads to the expression $f(y) = \\frac{f(1)}{f(0)}$ for all $y \\neq 0$.\nStep 8:  We can then use the condition $f(-1) \\neq 0$ to derive the value of $f(0)$.\nStep 9:  By substituting $x = -1$ and $y = 0$ in the functional equation, we get $f(0) = f(-1) f(0)$, which implies $f(0) = 1$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, we have $f(x) = f(1)$ for all $x \\neq 0$ and $f(0) = 1$.\nStep 11:  Substituting $x = 0$ in the functional equation, we get $f(1) - f(y) = f(0) f(y)$, which simplifies to $f(y) = f(1)$ for all $y \\neq 0$.\nStep 12:  Hence, we have $f(x) = f(1)$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nStep 13:  Therefore, the function $f(x) = f(1)$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is the solution to the given functional equation and the condition $f(-1) \\neq 0$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of disjoint pairs of elements from the set $\\{1,2, \\ldots, n\\}$ such that the sums of the different pairs are different integers not exceeding $n$.\nStep 2:  We can start by considering the possible pairs of elements from the set and their sums. Since the sums of the different pairs must be different integers not exceeding $n$, we can think of this as distributing the numbers from $1$ to $n$ into pairs such that the sum of each pair is unique.\nStep 3:  We can approach this problem by considering the pairs of elements and their sums in a systematic way. We can start with the smallest possible pair, which is $(1,2)$, and then consider the next possible pairs, such as $(1,3)$, $(2,3)$, and so on.\nStep 4:  We can use a systematic approach to find the maximum number of disjoint pairs by considering the possible pairs and their sums.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to carefully consider the conditions given and understand how to maximize the number of triples of cells that satisfy the specified conditions.\nStep 2:  We are dealing with a $999 \\times 999$ square table, where some cells are white and the remaining ones are red. We want to find the maximum value of the number of triples $\\left(C_{1}, C_{2}, C_{3}\\right)$ of cells, where the first two cells are in the same row and the last two cells are in the same column, with $C_{1}$ and $C_{3}$ being white and $C_{2}$ being red.\nStep 3:  To approach this problem, we can start by considering the number of ways to choose the first cell, $C_{1}$. Since it must be white, there are $999 \\times 999$ possible choices for $C_{1}$.\nStep 4:  Next, we need to choose the second cell, $C_{2}$. It must be red and in the same row as $C_{1}$. This means there are $999 - 1 = 998$ possible choices for $C_{2}$, as we have to exclude the cell $C_{1}$ itself.\nStep 5:  After choosing $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$, we move on to the third cell, $C_{3}$. It must be white and in the same column as $C_{2}$. Similar to the case of $C_{2}$, there are $999 - 1 = 998$ possible choices for $C_{3}$.\nStep 6:  Now, we can calculate the total number of triples by multiplying the number of choices for each cell: $999 \\times 998 \\times 998$.\nStep 7:  However, we need to consider that this count includes some triples more than once. For instance, if we choose the first cell in the first row and the second cell in the same row, the third cell will be in the same column as the second cell, but it will also be in the same column as the first cell. This means that the count of triples is not accurate.\nStep 8:  To correct for this overcounting, we need to divide the total count by $2$, as each triple is counted twice.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the maximum value $T$ can attain is $\\frac{999 \\times 998 \\times 998}{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{498000498}$",
  "## Step 1: Understand the problem and the rules of the game\nThe problem describes a game played between two players, A and B, using a certain number of coins and boxes arranged in a circle. Player A initially distributes the coins among the boxes so that each box has at least one coin. Then, the players take turns making moves according to specific rules. Player B passes one coin from every box to an adjacent box, while Player A chooses several coins that were not involved in B's previous move and are in different boxes, then passes every chosen coin to an adjacent box. The goal of Player A is to ensure that at least one coin remains in each box after every move of hers, regardless of how B plays and how many moves are made.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the key constraints and requirements\nThe problem requires finding the least number of coins, N, that enables Player A to succeed in ensuring at least one coin in each box after every move of hers. The constraints are that N must be greater than or equal to 2012, and the coins must be distributed among the boxes so that each box initially has at least one coin.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the possible moves and their implications\nPlayer B's move involves passing one coin from every box to an adjacent box, which does not change the total number of coins. Player A's move involves choosing several coins that were not involved in B's previous move and are in different boxes, then passing every chosen coin to an adjacent box. This means that Player A can move coins that are not adjacent to the coins moved by Player B.\n\n## Step 4: Consider the minimum number of coins required for Player A to succeed\nTo ensure that at least one coin remains in each box after every move of hers, Player A needs to have enough coins to cover all the boxes. Since there are 2012 boxes, the minimum number of coins required for Player A to succeed is 2012.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the impact of Player B's moves on the number of coins\nPlayer B's moves involve passing one coin from every box to an adjacent box, which does not change the total number of coins. However, if Player B moves all the coins in a box to an adjacent box, Player A will not be able to move any coins from that box. This means that Player A needs to have at least one coin in each box to ensure that she can move coins from all the boxes.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the least N that enables Player A to succeed\nBased on the analysis, the least N that enables Player A to succeed is 2012.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2012}$",

The total area of the rectangles is given by the sum of their side lengths, which is $1 + 2 + 3 + \\ldots + 10 = 55$.\n\n## Step 3: Find the possible values of $m$\nSince the total area of the rectangles is $55$, we have $m^2 = 55$.

However, since $m$ must be an integer, we need to find the integer values of $m$ that satisfy the equation.\n\n## Step 5: Check for integer solutions\nWe can check for integer solutions by finding the square roots of the numbers that are close to $55$. The square roots of $49$ and $64$ are $7$ and $8$, respectively. Since $55$ is between $49$ and $64$, we can try $m = 7$ and $m = 8$.\n\n## Step 6: Check if $m = 7$ is a solution\nIf $m = 7$, then the area of the square is $7^2 = 49$. However, the total area of the rectangles is $55$, which is greater than $49$. Therefore, $m = 7$ is not a solution.\n\n## Step 7: Check if $m = 8$ is a solution\nIf $m = 8$, then the area of the square is $8^2 = 64$.

  "Step 1: Problem Explanation\nThe problem requires us to find the smallest integer $m$ such that if a dictionary $\\mathcal{D}$ contains at least $m$ different strings, then Lexi can fill a $k \\times k$ grid in a specific manner. The grid must be filled such that each column contains a string from $\\mathcal{D}$ when read from top-to-bottom and each row contains a string from $\\mathcal{D}$ when read from left-to-right.\nStep 2:\nTo approach this problem, we need to consider the constraints and requirements for filling the grid. We are given that the dictionary $\\mathcal{D}$ consists of some $k$-letter strings containing only the letters $A$ and $B$. This means that each string in $\\mathcal{D}$ is a sequence of $k$ letters, where each letter is either $A$ or $B$.\n\n```\nimport math\n# Define the variable k\nk = 3\n```\nStep 3:\nWe need to find the smallest integer $m$ such that if $\\mathcal{D}$ contains at least $m$ different strings, then Lexi can fill her grid in the specified manner.

Each string can be represented as a binary number, where $A$ is represented as $0$ and $B$ is represented as $1$. This allows us to count the number of possible strings in $\\mathcal{D}$.\n\n```\n# Calculate the minimum number of strings required\nmin_strings = num_strings\n```\nStep 5:\nTo ensure that Lexi can fill the grid, we need to consider the constraints on the arrangement of strings in the grid. We can use the concept of a \"bad\" string, which is a string that cannot be arranged in the grid. We can then use this concept to find the smallest integer $m$.\n\n```\n# Calculate the smallest integer m\nm = min_strings\n```\nStep 6: Finally, we'll combine all the steps into a function and execute it using the INST format.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_problem():\n    # Define the variable k\n    k = 3\n\n    # Calculate the number of possible strings in D\n    num_strings = 2 ** k\n\n    # Calculate the minimum number of strings required\n    min_strings = num_strings\n\n    # Calculate the smallest integer m\n    m = min_strings\n\n    return m\n\nresult = solve_problem()\nprint(\"The final answer is \\boxed{\" + str(result) + \"}.",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given information and the properties of an increasing sequence of numbers with an odd number of terms.\nStep 2:  We are told that the difference between any two consecutive terms in the sequence is a constant $d$, and the middle term of the original sequence is 302.\nStep 3:  When the last 4 terms are removed from the sequence, the middle term of the resulting sequence is 296. This gives us a clue about the relationship between the terms in the sequence.\nStep 4:  Let's denote the number of terms in the original sequence as $2n + 1$, where $n$ is a positive integer. This means the middle term is the $(n+1)$th term.\nStep 5:  We are given that the $(n+1)$th term is 302, and the $(2n+1)$th term is 296. This implies that the difference between the $(2n+1)$th term and the $(n+1)$th term is $296 - 302 = -6$.\nStep 6:  Since the difference between any two consecutive terms is a constant $d$, we can express the difference between the $(2n+1)$th term and the $(n+1)$th term as $d \\cdot (2n - n) = 2nd$.\nStep 7:  Equating this to the difference we found earlier, we get $2nd = -6$.\nStep 8:  Solving for $d$, we find that $d = -6 / (2n) = -3/n$.\nStep 9:  However, we are also given that the difference between the $(n+1)$th term and the $(n-1)$th term is $d$, which is equal to the difference between the $(2n+1)$th term and the $(n+1)$th term, i.e., $d = 296 - 302 = -6$.\nStep 10:  Equating these two expressions for $d$, we get $-3/n = -6$, which simplifies to $n = 2$.\nStep 11:  Substituting $n = 2$ into the expression for $d$, we find that $d = -3/2$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the value of $d$ is $\\boxed{-3/2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-\\frac{3}{2}}",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to find the individual functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ by using the given equations.\nStep 2:  We are given two equations: $f(x)+g(x)=3x+5$ and $f(x)-g(x)=5x+7$.\nStep 3:  To find $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, we can add the two equations together to eliminate $g(x)$ and solve for $f(x)$.\nStep 4:  Adding the two equations gives us: $f(x)+g(x)+f(x)-g(x)=3x+5+5x+7$, which simplifies to $2f(x)=8x+12$.\nStep 5:  Dividing both sides by 2 gives us $f(x)=4x+6$.\nStep 6:  Next, we can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate $f(x)$ and solve for $g(x)$.\nStep 7:  Subtracting the second equation from the first gives us: $f(x)+g(x)-f(x)+g(x)=3x+5-(5x+7)$, which simplifies to $2g(x)=-2x-2$.\nStep 8:  Dividing both sides by 2 gives us $g(x)=-x-1$.\nStep 9:  Now that we have found $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, we can substitute $x=2$ into these functions to find $f(2)$ and $g(2)$.\nStep 10:  Substituting $x=2$ into $f(x)=4x+6$ gives us $f(2)=4(2)+6=14$.\nStep 11:  Substituting $x=2$ into $g(x)=-x-1$ gives us $g(2)=-2-1=-3$.\nStep 12:  Finally, we can find the value of $2f(2)g(2)$ by multiplying $f(2)$ and $g(2)$ together and then multiplying the result by 2.\nStep 13:  Multiplying $f(2)=14$ and $g(2)=-3$ gives us $14 \\times -3 = -42$.\nStep 14:  Multiplying $-42$ by 2 gives us $-84$.\nStep 15:  Therefore, the value of $2f(2)g(2)$ is $\\boxed{-84}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-84}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first understand what an arithmetic sequence is and how we can determine if a sequence of three numbers is an arithmetic sequence.\nStep 2:  An arithmetic sequence is a sequence in which each term after the first is obtained from the previous term by adding a constant. For example, 3,5,7,9 is an arithmetic sequence with four terms.\nStep 3:  Now, we are given a set of five numbers: $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$, and we need to choose three different numbers from this set at random and arrange them in increasing order.\nStep 4:  We are asked to find the probability that the resulting sequence is an arithmetic sequence.\nStep 5:  To approach this problem, we need to first determine the total number of possible sequences of three numbers that can be chosen from the set.\nStep 6:  Then, we need to find the number of sequences that are arithmetic sequences.\nStep 7:  We can use the concept of combinations to find the total number of possible sequences. There are $\\binom{5}{3}=10$ ways to choose three numbers from the set.\nStep 8:  Now, let's consider the possible arithmetic sequences that can be formed from the set. We can have sequences like 1,2,3; 2,3,4; 3,4,5; 1,3,5; 2,4,6; and 1,4,7. However, we need to note that 2,4,6 and 1,4,7 are not valid sequences as they are not formed from the given set.\nStep 9:  Therefore, there are only 5 valid arithmetic sequences: 1,2,3; 2,3,4; 3,4,5; 1,3,5; and 2,4,6 is not valid, but 1,4,7 is not valid either, so we are left with 5 valid sequences.\nStep 10:  Now, we can calculate the probability by dividing the number of successful outcomes (5 valid arithmetic sequences) by the total number of possible outcomes (10).\nStep 11:  Therefore, the probability that the resulting sequence is an arithmetic sequence is $\\frac{5}{10} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to consider the speed of the current and Serge's paddling speed.\nStep 2:  Let's denote the speed of the current as $c$ and Serge's paddling speed as $s$.\nStep 3:  When Serge paddles with the current, his effective speed is $s + c$, and it takes him 18 minutes to get from point $A$ to point $B$.\nStep 4:  On the other hand, when he paddles against the current, his effective speed is $s - c$, and it takes him 30 minutes to get from $A$ to $B$.\nStep 5:  We can use the formula $d = rt$ to relate the distance, speed, and time. Since the distance from $A$ to $B$ is the same in both cases, we can set up the following equations:\nStep 6:  For paddling with the current: $d = (s + c) \\cdot \\frac{18}{60}$\nStep 7:  For paddling against the current: $d = (s - c) \\cdot \\frac{30}{60}$\nStep 8:  Since the distance $d$ is the same in both cases, we can equate the two expressions and solve for the ratio of $s$ to $c$.\nStep 9:  This gives us the equation $\\frac{s + c}{s - c} = \\frac{30}{18}$.\nStep 10:  Solving for the ratio of $s$ to $c$, we get $\\frac{s}{c} = \\frac{30 + 18}{30 - 18} = \\frac{48}{12} = 4$.\nStep 11:  Now, we need to find the time it would take Serge to paddle from $A$ to $B$ if there were no current. This can be calculated using the formula $t = \\frac{d}{s}$, where $d$ is the distance and $s$ is Serge's paddling speed.\nStep 12:  Since we know the ratio of $s$ to $c$ is 4, we can express $s$ in terms of $c$ as $s = 4c$.\nStep 13:  Substituting this into the formula, we get $t = \\frac{d}{4c}$.\nStep 14:  We also know that the distance $d$ is equal to the speed of the current $c$ multiplied by the time it takes to paddle against the current, which is 30 minutes. So, $d = c \\cdot 30$.\nStep 15:  Substituting this into the formula, we get $t = \\frac{c \\cdot 30}{4c}$.\nStep 16:  Simplifying, we find that $t = \\frac{30}{4} = \\boxed{7.5}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7.5}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first understand the given scenario. We have a square $O P Q R$ with vertices at $O(0,0), P(0,8), Q(8,8)$, and $R(8,0)$. There's a parabola with the equation $y=a(x-2)(x-6)$ that intersects the sides of the square at points $K, L, M$, and $N$.\nStep 2:  We're asked to find all the values of $a$ for which the area of the trapezoid $K L M N$ is 36.\nStep 3:  To start, we need to find the coordinates of the points $K, L, M$, and $N$ where the parabola intersects the sides of the square.\nStep 4:  We can do this by substituting the $x$-coordinates of the sides of the square into the equation of the parabola to find the corresponding $y$-coordinates.\nStep 5:  For the side $OP$, we substitute $x=0$ into the equation of the parabola to get $y=a(0-2)(0-6) = 12a$. This gives us the coordinates of point $K$ as $(0,12a)$.\nStep 6:  Similarly, for the side $OQ$, we substitute $x=8$ into the equation of the parabola to get $y=a(8-2)(8-6) = 24a$. This gives us the coordinates of point $L$ as $(8,24a)$.\nStep 7:  For the side $QR$, we substitute $x=8$ into the equation of the parabola to get $y=a(8-2)(8-6) = 24a$. This gives us the coordinates of point $M$ as $(8,24a)$.\nStep 8:  For the side $RP$, we substitute $x=0$ into the equation of the parabola to get $y=a(0-2)(0-6) = 12a$. This gives us the coordinates of point $N$ as $(0,12a)$.\nStep 9:  Now that we have the coordinates of the points $K, L, M$, and $N$, we can use the formula for the area of a trapezoid to find the area of $K L M N$.\nStep 10:  The formula for the area of a trapezoid is $\\frac{1}{2}h(b_1+b_2)$, where $h$ is the height and $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the lengths of the two bases.\nStep 11:  In this case, the height of the trapezoid is the distance between the $x$-coordinates of points $K$ and $L$, which is $8-0=8$.\nStep 12:  The lengths of the two bases are the distances between the $y$-coordinates of points $K$ and $L$, and points $M$ and $N$, which are $24a-12a=12a$ and $12a-12a=0$, respectively.\nStep 13:  Substituting these values into the formula for the area of a trapezoid, we get $\\frac{1}{2}(8)(12a+0)=36$.\nStep 14:  Solving for $a$, we get $6a=9$, which gives us $a=\\frac{9}{6}=\\frac{3}{2}$.\nStep 15:  Therefore, the values of $a$ for which the area of the trapezoid $K L M N$ is 36 are $a=\\frac{3}{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}",

This means that the probability of living at least 5 more years is less than or equal to the probability of living at least 10 more years.\nStep 10:  We can use the given probabilities to calculate the probability of an 80-year-old person living at least another 5 years.\nStep 11:  We know that the probability of living at least 10 more years is $25 \\%$, and the probability of living at least 15 more years is $20 \\%$. Since the probability of living at least 15 more years is less than the probability of living at least 10 more years, we can conclude that the probability of living at least 5 more years is greater than $25 \\%$.\nStep 12:  However, we also know that the probability of living at least 15 more years is $20 \\%$, which is less than the probability of living at least 10 more years.

  "To find the probability that the product of the two numbers on the top faces is divisible by 5, we need to consider all the possible outcomes of throwing two dice and count the number of outcomes where the product is divisible by 5.\n\n## Step 1: Determine the total number of possible outcomes when throwing two dice.\nEach die has 6 faces, so when throwing two dice, the total number of possible outcomes is 6 * 6 = 36.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the combinations where the product of the two numbers is divisible by 5.\nFor the product to be divisible by 5, at least one of the numbers must be a 5 or a multiple of 5, or both numbers must be multiples of 5. However, since the only multiples of 5 on a standard die are 5 itself, we focus on the combinations involving 5.\n\n## Step 3: Count the combinations where at least one die shows a 5.\n- If the first die shows a 5, there are 6 possibilities for the second die (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), making 6 combinations.\n- If the second die shows a 5, there are 6 possibilities for the first die (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), making another 6 combinations.\n- However, we counted the combination (5,5) twice, so we need to subtract 1 to avoid double-counting.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the total number of favorable outcomes.\nThe total number of favorable outcomes is 6 (first die is 5) + 6 (second die is 5) - 1 (to correct for double-counting of (5,5)) = 11.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the probability.\nThe probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand how changes in the dimensions of the image and the resolution affect the total number of pixels.\nStep 2:  Initially, the image has dimensions of $10 \\mathrm{~cm}$ by $15 \\mathrm{~cm}$ and a resolution of 75 pixels/cm. This results in a total of $(10 \\times 75) \\times(15 \\times 75)=843750$ pixels.\nStep 3:  Now, if each of the dimensions is increased by $n \\%$ and the resolution is decreased by $n \\%$, we need to find the new dimensions and resolution in terms of $n$.\nStep 4:  Increasing each dimension by $n \\%$ means multiplying the original dimensions by $(1+\\frac{n}{100})$. Therefore, the new dimensions are $10(1+\\frac{n}{100})$ and $15(1+\\frac{n}{100})$.\nStep 5:  Decreasing the resolution by $n \\%$ means multiplying the original resolution by $(1-\\frac{n}{100})$. Therefore, the new resolution is $75(1-\\frac{n}{100})$.\nStep 6:  The total number of pixels in the new image is given by the product of the new dimensions and the new resolution, which is $(10(1+\\frac{n}{100})) \\times (15(1+\\frac{n}{100})) \\times (75(1-\\frac{n}{100}))$.\nStep 7:  We are given that this new total is equal to 345600 pixels. So, we can set up the equation $(10(1+\\frac{n}{100})) \\times (15(1+\\frac{n}{100})) \\times (75(1-\\frac{n}{100}))=345600$.\nStep 8:  Simplifying this equation, we get $(10+0.1n)(15+0.15n)(75-0.75n)=345600$.\nStep 9:  Expanding and simplifying further, we get $1125+15n+1.125n^2-7.5n^2=345600$.\nStep 10:  Combining like terms, we get $-5.875n^2+15n-333375=0$.\nStep 11:  We can solve this quadratic equation to find the value of $n$.\nStep 12:  Using the quadratic formula, $n=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$, where $a=-5.875$, $b=15$, and $c=-333375$.\nStep 13:  Plugging in these values, we get $n=\\frac{-15\\pm\\sqrt{15^2-4(-5.875)(-333375)}}{2(-5.875)}$.\nStep 14:  Simplifying further, we get $n=\\frac{-15\\pm\\sqrt{225-9877500}}{-11.75}$.\nStep 15:  This gives us $n=\\frac{-15\\pm\\sqrt{-9877375}}{-11.75}$.\nStep 16:  Since the square root of a negative number is not a real number, we can conclude that there is no real solution for $n$.\nStep 17:  However, we can express the solution in terms of the imaginary unit $i$, where $i=\\sqrt{-1}$.\nStep 18:  Therefore, $n=\\frac{-15\\pm i\\sqrt{9877375}}{-11.75}$.\nStep 19:  Simplifying further, we get $n=\\frac{-15\\pm i\\sqrt{9877375}}{-11.75}=\\frac{-15\\pm 3150i}{-11.75}$.\nStep 20:  This gives us two possible values for $n$: $n_1=\\frac{-15+3150i}{-11.75}$ and $n_2=\\frac{-15-3150i}{-11.75}$.\nStep 21:  However, we are looking for a real value of $n$, so we can ignore the imaginary part and consider only the real part of the solution.\nStep 22:  Therefore, the value of $n$ is $\\frac{-15}{-11.75}=\\boxed{1.273}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{20}$",

This means that each integer from 1 to $n$ appears exactly twice in the sequence.\nStep 3:  The second condition states that if $s_{i}=s_{j}=k$ with $i<j$, then $j-i=k$. This implies that if two equal elements appear in the sequence, the difference between their positions is equal to the value of the elements.\nStep 4:  The third condition states that between any two equal even integers, there is exactly one odd integer.

  "Eleanor has 100 marbles, each of which is black or gold. The ratio of the number of black marbles to the number of gold marbles is $1: 4$. How many gold marbles should she add to change this ratio to $1: 6$ ?\nStep 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given ratio of black to gold marbles, which is $1:4$. This means that for every 1 black marble, there are 4 gold marbles.\nStep 2:  We are also given that the total number of marbles is 100. Let's assume the number of black marbles is represented by $x$. Since the ratio of black to gold marbles is $1:4$, the number of gold marbles would be $4x$.\nStep 3:  Therefore, the total number of marbles, which is the sum of black and gold marbles, can be expressed as $x + 4x = 5x$. We know that this total is equal to 100, so we have the equation $5x = 100$.\nStep 4:  Solving for $x$, we find that $x = 20$. This means that there are 20 black marbles and $4x = 80$ gold marbles.\nStep 5:  Now, we are asked to find out how many gold marbles Eleanor should add to change the ratio to $1:6$. Let's assume she adds $y$ gold marbles to achieve this new ratio.\nStep 6:  The new ratio of black to gold marbles will be $1:6$, so the number of gold marbles will be $6x$. Since the total number of marbles remains the same, we can set up the equation $20 + y = 6x$.\nStep 7:  We already know that $x = 20$, so substituting this value into the equation gives us $20 + y = 6 \\cdot 20$.\nStep 8:  Solving for $y$, we find that $y = 6 \\cdot 20 - 20 = 120 - 20 = 100$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, Eleanor should add $\\boxed{100}$ gold marbles to change the ratio to $1:6$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{100}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first understand the given information and what is being asked. We are told that there are 40 balls in a bag, and each ball is either black or gold. Feridun randomly removes two balls from the bag, and we are given that the probability of removing two gold balls is $\\frac{5}{12}$.\nStep 2:  Let's denote the number of gold balls as $g$. Since there are 40 balls in total, the number of black balls would be $40 - g$.\nStep 3:  The probability of drawing two gold balls can be calculated using combinations.

The odd numbers on the die are 1, 3, and 4 is not odd, 6 is not odd, and 8 is not odd, so the odd numbers are 1, 3. There are 2 odd numbers out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability of rolling an odd number is $\\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\nStep 3:  If an odd number is rolled, all the odd numbers on the die are doubled.

The probability of rolling a 2 on the second roll, given that an even number was rolled first, is $\\frac{1}{6}$.\nStep 6:  To find the overall probability of rolling a 2 on the second roll, we need to consider both scenarios and their respective probabilities.

Since $x$ is positive, $\\lfloor x\\rfloor$ must also be positive.\nStep 4:  We know that $x\\lfloor x\\rfloor=17$, and since $x$ is positive, we can deduce that $\\lfloor x\\rfloor$ must be a factor of $17$.\nStep 5:  The factors of $17$ are $1$ and $17$ itself.

When the cube is cut into $n^{3}$ smaller cubes of unit length, we need to find the value of $n$ such that exactly 125 of these smaller cubes have no faces painted red.\nStep 3:  The number of smaller cubes with no faces painted red can be determined by considering the cubes that are not on the surface of the original cube. These cubes are located inside the cube and do not have any painted faces.\nStep 4:  We can calculate the number of these interior cubes by subtracting the number of surface cubes from the total number of cubes. The surface cubes include the cubes on the faces, edges, and corners of the original cube.\nStep 5:  The number of cubes on the faces of the cube is given by $6(n-2)^{2}$, as there are 6 faces and each face has $(n-2)^{2}$ cubes. The number of cubes on the edges is given by $12(n-2)$, as there are 12 edges and each edge has $(n-2)$ cubes. The number of cubes on the corners is given by $8$, as there are 8 corners and each corner has 1 cube.\nStep 6:  Therefore, the total number of surface cubes is $6(n-2)^{2} + 12(n-2) + 8$.\nStep 7:  The number of interior cubes is then given by $n^{3} - (6(n-2)^{2} + 12(n-2) + 8)$.\nStep 8:  We are given that this number is equal to 125, so we can set up the equation $n^{3} - (6(n-2)^{2} + 12(n-2) + 8) = 125$.\nStep 9:  By solving this equation, we can find the value of $n$ that satisfies the given condition.\nStep 10:  We can simplify the equation and solve for $n$ to find the value that makes the equation true.\nStep 11:  After simplifying the equation, we get $n^{3} - 6n^{2} + 12n - 8 = 125$.\nStep 12:  Rearranging the terms, we get $n^{3} - 6n^{2} + 12n - 133 = 0$.\nStep 13:  We can then solve this cubic equation to find the value of $n$ that satisfies the given condition.\nStep 14:  By solving the cubic equation, we find that $n = \\boxed{5}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$",

We are given that one face has an area of $27 \\mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ and another face has an area of $32 \\mathrm{~cm}^{2}$.\nStep 3:  We can express these areas as $lw=27$ and $wh=32$. Multiplying these two equations gives us $l^2w^2h^2=864$.\nStep 4:  Taking the square root of both sides, we get $lwh=12$. This is the volume of the prism, which is given as $144 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.\nStep 5:  We can then solve for the product of the three dimensions, $lwh$, which is equal to $12$. This implies that the product of the three dimensions is $12$.\nStep 6:  Now, we need to find the surface area of the prism, which is given by the formula $2lw+2lh+2wh$.\nStep 7:  We can simplify this expression by substituting the values of $lw$ and $wh$ that we obtained earlier.\nStep 8:  This gives us $2(27+32)+l^2h^2$. We know that $lwh=12$, so we can substitute this value to get $2(59)+l^2h^2$.\nStep 9:  Since $lwh=12$, we can express $l^2h^2$ as $lwh \\cdot wh = 12 \\cdot 32 = 384$.\nStep 10:  Substituting this value, we get $2(59)+384=422$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the surface area of the prism is $\\boxed{422}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{422}$",

Expanding $y=a(x-2)(x+4)$ gives us $y=a(x^{2}+2x-8)$.\nStep 4:  Now, we can compare the coefficients of the two equations. The coefficient of $x^{2}$ in the first equation is $a$, and the coefficient of $x^{2}$ in the second equation is $2$. Therefore, we have $a=2$.\nStep 5:  Next, we need to find the values of $h$ and $k$. We can do this by comparing the linear and constant terms in the two equations.\nStep 6:  The linear term in the first equation is $2ax$, and the linear term in the second equation is $-2h(x-h)$. Equating these gives us $2ax=-2h(x-h)$.\nStep 7:  Since we already know that $a=2$, we can substitute this value into the equation to get $4x=-2h(x-h)$.\nStep 8:  Expanding the right-hand side of the equation gives us $4x=-2hx+2h^{2}$.\nStep 9:  Rearranging the terms, we get $2hx-2h^{2}=4x$.\nStep 10:  Comparing the coefficients of $x$ on both sides, we find that $h=2$.\nStep 11:  Now that we have the value of $h$, we can substitute it back into the equation $2hx-2h^{2}=4x$ to solve for $k$.\nStep 12:  Substituting $h=2$ gives us $4x-8=4x$, which simplifies to $-8=0$. This is a contradiction, so we need to re-examine our previous steps.\nStep 13:  Upon re-examining, we realize that we made an error in our previous steps. We should have compared the constant terms in the two equations to find the value of $k$.\nStep 14:  The constant term in the first equation is $-8a$, and the constant term in the second equation is $k$. Equating these gives us $-8a=k$.\nStep 15:  Substituting $a=2$ into the equation gives us $-16=k$.\nStep 16:  Therefore, the values of $a, h,$ and $k$ are $a=2$, $h=1$, and $k=-16$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2, 1, -16}$",

In this case, the fifth term is also 5.\nStep 14:  If $d=-\\frac{10}{3}$, then the fifth term is $a_5 = a + 4d = 5 + 4\\left(-\\frac{10}{3}\\right) = 5 - \\frac{40}{3} = -\\frac{5}{3}$.\nStep 15:  Therefore, the possible values of the fifth term are 5 and $-\\frac{5}{3}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5, -\\frac{5}{3}}$",

The distance between points $A(1,2)$ and $B(11,2)$ can be found using the distance formula, which is $\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$.

Then, we can express $S$ as the sum of the individual terms $a_{1}-a_{2}+a_{3}-a_{4}+a_{5}-a_{6}+a_{7}$ over all permutations.\nStep 3:  Now, we need to find the sum of each term $a_{i}$ over all permutations. Since there are $7$ numbers, each number will appear in each position $7$ times. Therefore, the sum of each term $a_{i}$ over all permutations is $7 \\cdot \\frac{1+2+3+4+5+6+7}{7} = 28$.\nStep 4:  Next, we need to find the sum of each term $a_{i}$ over all permutations, but with a negative sign. This can be done by finding the sum of each term $a_{i}$ over all permutations and then multiplying it by $-1$. Therefore, the sum of each term $a_{i}$ with a negative sign is $-28$.\nStep 5:  Now, we can express the sum $S$ as the sum of the individual terms $a_{1}-a_{2}+a_{3}-a_{4}+a_{5}-a_{6}+a_{7}$ over all permutations. This can be written as $S = (a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}+a_{4}+a_{5}+a_{6}+a_{7}) - (a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}+a_{4}+a_{5}+a_{6}+a_{7})$.\nStep 6:  Simplifying the expression, we get $S = 0$.\nStep 7:  However, we need to find the average value of the expression over all permutations. To do this, we need to divide the sum $S$ by the total number of permutations, which is $7!$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the average value of the expression is $\\frac{S}{7!} = \\frac{0}{7!} = 0$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

This gives us $f(3) = 2f(0) + 3 = 2(6) + 3 = 12 + 3 = 15$.\nStep 4:  Now, we need to find the value of $f(9)$. To do this, we can use the property again by substituting $x = 3$ into the equation $f(2x+3) = 2f(x) + 3$. This gives us $f(9) = 2f(3) + 3 = 2(15) + 3 = 30 + 3 = 33$.\nStep 5:  Therefore, the value of $f(9)$ is $33$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{33}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve the given system of equations and find the values of $x$ for which $f(x)=g(x)$, we first need to isolate one of the variables in one of the equations.\nStep 2:  Let's start by isolating $f(x)$ in the first equation. We can do this by subtracting $3g(x)$ from both sides of the equation, which gives us $f(x) = x^2 + x + 6 - 3g(x)$.\nStep 3:  Next, we can substitute this expression for $f(x)$ into the second equation. This will allow us to solve for $g(x)$.\nStep 4:  Substituting $f(x) = x^2 + x + 6 - 3g(x)$ into the second equation gives us $2(x^2 + x + 6 - 3g(x)) + 4g(x) = 2x^2 + 4$.\nStep 5:  Simplifying this equation, we get $2x^2 + 2x + 12 - 6g(x) + 4g(x) = 2x^2 + 4$, which further simplifies to $-2g(x) = -8$.\nStep 6:  Solving for $g(x)$, we find that $g(x) = 4$.\nStep 7:  Now that we have the value of $g(x)$, we can substitute it back into the expression for $f(x)$ to find $f(x)$. Substituting $g(x) = 4$ into the expression $f(x) = x^2 + x + 6 - 3g(x)$ gives us $f(x) = x^2 + x + 6 - 3(4) = x^2 + x - 6$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, we have found that $f(x) = x^2 + x - 6$ and $g(x) = 4$.\nStep 9:  To find the values of $x$ for which $f(x) = g(x)$, we need to set the two expressions equal to each other and solve for $x$. This gives us the equation $x^2 + x - 6 = 4$.\nStep 10:  Simplifying this equation, we get $x^2 + x - 10 = 0$.\nStep 11:  We can solve this quadratic equation by factoring it as $(x + 5)(x - 2) = 0$.\nStep 12:  Setting each factor equal to zero, we find that $x + 5 = 0$ or $x - 2 = 0$.\nStep 13:  Solving for $x$ in each equation, we get $x = -5$ or $x = 2$.\nStep 14:  Therefore, the values of $x$ for which $f(x) = g(x)$ are $x = -5$ and $x = 2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",

The number of multiples of 3 less than or equal to 300 is given by $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{300}{3} \\right\\rfloor = 100$. Similarly, the number of multiples of 5 less than or equal to 300 is $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{300}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 60$.\nStep 3:  However, we need to be cautious about counting the multiples of 10 and 15 twice. The number of multiples of 10 less than or equal to 300 is $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{300}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 30$, and the number of multiples of 15 less than or equal to 300 is $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{300}{15} \\right\\rfloor = 20$.\nStep 4:  To find the total number of multiples of 3 or 5, we add the number of multiples of 3 and 5 and then subtract the number of multiples of 10 and 15 to correct for the double counting.

Each set of three terms will have one positive term and two negative terms.\nStep 4:  For example, the first set of three terms is $1-3+5$, the second set is $7-9-11$, and so on.\nStep 5:  We can see that each set of three terms has a sum of $3$. This is because the positive term is always one more than the sum of the two negative terms.\nStep 6:  Since we are looking for the sum of the first 300 terms, we can calculate the number of complete sets of three terms within the first 300 terms. This can be found by dividing 300 by 3, which gives us 100 complete sets of three terms.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the sum of the first 300 terms is equal to the sum of the 100 complete sets of three terms, which is $100 \\cdot 3 = 300$.\nStep 8:  However, we also need to consider the remaining terms after the last complete set of three terms.

Mathematically, this can be represented as $a^2 + 10b = b^2 + 10a$.\nStep 3:  Rearranging the terms, we get $a^2 - 10a + b^2 - 10b = 0$. This equation can be further simplified to $(a - 5)^2 + (b - 5)^2 = 50$.\nStep 4:  We are looking for two-digit numbers that satisfy this property and are prime numbers.

These pairs correspond to the values of $(a, b)$ as $(5, 5)$, $(6, 4)$, $(4, 6)$, and $(5, 5)$ respectively.\nStep 6:  However, we are interested in two-digit numbers, so we need to consider the pairs $(6, 4)$ and $(4, 6)$, which correspond to the numbers $64$ and $46$.\nStep 7:  We need to check if these numbers are prime. The number $64$ is not prime as it has factors other than $1$ and itself, whereas $46$ is also not prime as it has factors other than $1$ and itself.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the only two-digit number that satisfies the given property and is prime is $\\boxed{11}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{11}$",

This gives us the equation $2 + 7 + 6 + 10 + x = 15 + 9 + 12 + 8 + y$.\nStep 7:  Simplifying this equation, we get $25 + x = 44 + y$, which can be further simplified to $x - y = 19$.\nStep 8:  We also have the equation $3 + 4 + 2 + z = 20 - x - y$, which simplifies to $9 + z = 20 - x - y$.\nStep 9:  By solving the system of equations $x + y + z = 20$ and $x - y = 19$, we can find the values of $x, y,$ and $z$.\nStep 10:  Solving the first equation for $z$, we get $z = 20 - x - y$.\nStep 11:  Substituting this expression for $z$ into the second equation, we get $x - y = 19$.\nStep 12:  Solving for $x$ in terms of $y$, we find $x = y + 19$.\nStep 13:  Substituting this expression for $x$ into the equation $x + y + z = 20$, we get $(y + 19) + y + z = 20$.\nStep 14:  Simplifying this equation, we get $2y + z + 19 = 20$.\nStep 15:  Rearranging the terms, we have $2y + z = 1$.\nStep 16:  We also have the equation $9 + z = 20 - x - y$, which can be rewritten as $z = 11 - x - y$.\nStep 17:  Substituting this expression for $z$ into the equation $2y + z = 1$, we get $2y + 11 - x - y = 1$.\nStep 18:  Simplifying this equation, we find $y - x = -10$.\nStep 19:  We now have a system of two equations: $x - y = 19$ and $y - x = -10$.\nStep 20:  Adding these two equations together, we get $0 = 9$, which is a contradiction.\nStep 21:  This means that the initial assumption that the values of $x, y,$ and $z$ are integers is incorrect.\nStep 22:  Therefore, we need to re-examine the problem and consider the possibility that the values of $x, y,$ and $z$ are not integers.\nStep 23:  Let's re-evaluate the equations and consider the possibility that the values of $x, y,$ and $z$ are fractions.\nStep 24:  We can start by re-examining the equation $x + y + z = 20$ and the equation $x - y = 19$.\nStep 25:  We can also re-evaluate the equation $9 + z = 20 - x - y$ and consider the possibility that the values of $x, y,$ and $z$ are fractions.\nStep 26:  By re-examining the equations and considering the possibility that the values of $x, y,$ and $z$ are fractions, we can find the correct values of $x, y,$ and $z$.\nStep 27:  After re-evaluating the equations, we find that $x = 11$, $y = 8$, and $z = 1$.\nStep 28:  Therefore, the values of $x, y,$ and $z$ are $x = 11$, $y = 8$, and $z = 1$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{11}$",
  "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the geometric configuration and apply principles of geometry and trigonometry.\n## Step 2:  First, we visualize the setup: a right-angled triangle formed by welding three metal rods of lengths 9, 12, and 15 together, with a solid sphere of radius 5 resting in the triangle, tangent to each of the three sides.\n## Step 3:  We recognize that the triangle formed by the rods is a Pythagorean triple (9, 12, 15), which means it follows the Pythagorean theorem where the square of the length of the hypotenuse (15) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (9 and 12).\n## Step 4:  The sphere is tangent to each side of the triangle, which implies that the points of tangency form right angles with the sides of the triangle. This configuration suggests that the triangle formed by connecting the centers of the sphere to the points of tangency on the triangle's sides is similar to the original triangle.\n## Step 5:  We can use the similarity of the triangles to find the height of the sphere above the plane of the triangle. The key insight is that the ratio of the heights of the triangles is the same as the ratio of their corresponding sides.\n## Step 6:  The height of the original triangle (the one formed by the rods) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, but since we're interested in the height of the sphere above the triangle's plane, we need to consider the smaller triangle formed by the radius of the sphere and the segments from the center of the sphere to the points of tangency on the triangle's sides.\n## Step 7:  The smaller triangle is similar to the larger triangle, and the ratio of their corresponding sides is the same. This allows us to set up a proportion to find the height of the sphere above the triangle's plane.\n## Step 8:  The height of the sphere above the triangle's plane can be found by calculating the difference between the height of the original triangle and the height of the smaller triangle formed by the radius of the sphere and the segments from the center of the sphere to the points of tangency.\n## Step 9:  To find the height of the original triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b), or a^2 + b^2 = c^2.\n## Step 10:  In this case, the lengths of the two sides of the original triangle are 9 and 12, so we can calculate the height of the original triangle using the Pythagorean theorem.\n## Step 11:  The height of the original triangle is the square root of the difference between the square of the length of the hypotenuse (15^2) and the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (9^2 + 12^2).\n## Step 12:  The height of the original triangle is sqrt(15^2 - (9^2 + 12^2)) = sqrt(225 - 225) = sqrt(0) = 0, but this is not the height we are looking for. We need to find the height of the smaller triangle formed by the radius of the sphere and the segments from the center of the sphere to the points of tangency.\n## Step 13:  The smaller triangle is similar to the original triangle, and the ratio of their corresponding sides is the same. This allows us to set up a proportion to find the height of the smaller triangle.\n## Step 14:  The ratio of the height of the smaller triangle to the height of the original triangle is equal to the ratio of the radius of the sphere to the length of the hypotenuse of the original triangle.\n## Step 15:  We can use this proportion to find the height of the smaller triangle, which is the height of the sphere above the triangle's plane.\n## Step 16:  The height of the sphere above the triangle's plane is the height of the smaller triangle, which is equal to the radius of the sphere times the ratio of the height of the original triangle to the length of the hypotenuse of the original triangle.\n## Step 17:  The height of the sphere above the triangle's plane is 5 * (12/15) = 4.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$",
  "Step 1: To find the measure of angle A C B, we can use the Law of Cosines, which relates the lengths of the sides of a triangle to the cosine of one of its angles.\nStep 2: First, we need to find the lengths of the sides of the triangle. We can do this using the distance formula, which is derived from the Pythagorean theorem.\nStep 3: The distance formula is given by: d = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2), where (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are the coordinates of the two points.\nStep 4: Using this formula, we can find the lengths of the sides AB, BC, and AC.\nStep 5: The length of AB is given by: AB = sqrt((3 - 0)^2 + (0 - 5)^2) = sqrt(9 + 25) = sqrt(34).\nStep 6: The length of BC is given by: BC = sqrt((8 - 3)^2 + (3 - 0)^2) = sqrt(25 + 9) = sqrt(34).\nStep 7: The length of AC is given by: AC = sqrt((8 - 0)^2 + (3 - 5)^2) = sqrt(64 + 4) = sqrt(68).\nStep 8: Now that we have the lengths of the sides, we can use the Law of Cosines to find the measure of angle A C B.\nStep 9: The Law of Cosines states that for a triangle with sides a, b, and c, and angle C opposite side c, we have: c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab * cos(C).\nStep 10: In this case, we have a = AB, b = BC, and c = AC. We want to find angle A C B, which is opposite side AC.\nStep 11: Plugging in the values, we get: AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 - 2 * AB * BC * cos(A C B).\nStep 12: Simplifying, we get: 68 = 34 + 34 - 2 * sqrt(34) * sqrt(34) * cos(A C B).\nStep 13: Further simplifying, we get: 68 = 68 - 68 * cos(A C B).\nStep 14: Solving for cos(A C B), we get: cos(A C B) = 0.\nStep 15: Since the cosine of an angle is 0, the angle must be 90 degrees.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{90}$",

  "## Step 1:  To find the probability that $a^{b}$ is an even number, we first need to understand the conditions under which $a^{b}$ will be even.\n## Step 2:  We know that for $a^{b}$ to be even, $b$ must be even because any number raised to an even power results in an even number.\n## Step 3:  Given that $b$ is chosen randomly from the set $\\{6,7,8\\}$, we need to determine the probability of $b$ being even.\n## Step 4:  Out of the three possible values for $b$, only one value, which is 8, is even.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to consider the possible outcomes of Julia's actions on each turn and calculate the probability of the bag containing 4 blue hats and 2 green hats after two turns.\nStep 2:  Initially, the bag contains 4 blue hats and 2 green hats, making a total of 6 hats.\nStep 3:  On the first turn, Julia can either pick a blue hat or a green hat. If she picks a blue hat, there will be 5 blue hats and 2 green hats left in the bag. If she picks a green hat, there will be 4 blue hats and 3 green hats left in the bag.\nStep 4:  Now, we need to consider the possible outcomes of the second turn based on the first turn's outcome.\nStep 5:  If Julia picks a blue hat on the first turn, there will be 5 blue hats and 2 green hats left. On the second turn, she can either pick a blue hat or a green hat. If she picks a blue hat, there will be 6 blue hats and 2 green hats left, which is not the desired outcome. If she picks a green hat, there will be 5 blue hats and 3 green hats left, which is also not the desired outcome.\nStep 6:  If Julia picks a green hat on the first turn, there will be 4 blue hats and 3 green hats left. On the second turn, she can either pick a blue hat or a green hat. If she picks a blue hat, there will be 5 blue hats and 3 green hats left, which is not the desired outcome. If she picks a green hat, there will be 4 blue hats and 4 green hats left, which is also not the desired outcome.\nStep 7:  However, we can also consider the scenario where Julia picks a blue hat on the first turn and then a green hat on the second turn, or picks a green hat on the first turn and then a blue hat on the second turn. In both cases, the bag will contain 4 blue hats and 3 green hats, which is not the desired outcome.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the only way for the bag to contain 4 blue hats and 2 green hats after two turns is if Julia picks a green hat on the first turn and then a green hat on the second turn.\nStep 9:  The probability of picking a green hat on the first turn is $\\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}$, and the probability of picking a green hat on the second turn is $\\frac{3}{7}$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the probability that the bag again contains 4 blue hats and 2 green hats after two turns is $\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{3}{7} = \\frac{1}{7}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{7}}$",
  "Step 1:  We are given two equations involving the trigonometric functions sine and cosine of angles $x$ and $y$.

We can continue the pattern of multiplying the previous two terms to obtain the next term.\nStep 9:  The 7th term is $2^{15} \\cdot 5^5 \\cdot 10 = 2^{16} \\cdot 5^6$, the 8th term is $2^{16} \\cdot 5^6 \\cdot 5 = 2^{16} \\cdot 5^7$, and so on.\nStep 10:  Continuing this pattern, we can see that the exponent of 5 in the 15th term will be $5+10+15+20+25+30+35+40+45+50+55+60+65+70+75 = 600$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the 15th term will have $600$ zeroes at the end, which is the value of $k$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{600}$",

This gives us $\\log _{2} x-2 \\log _{2} y=2 \\log _{2} x$.\nStep 3:  Next, we can use the property $\\log _{a} b-\\log _{a} c=\\log _{a} \\frac{b}{c}$ to combine the logarithms on the left-hand side of the equation.

In the context of the triangle, this means that the side lengths can be represented as $a-d, a, a+d$, where $a$ is the middle side length and $d$ is the common difference between consecutive terms.\nStep 3:  Given that one side length is 60, we can express the other two side lengths as $60-d$ and $60+d$. Since the side lengths form an arithmetic sequence, we have the equation $60-d = a-d$ and $60+d = a+d$.\nStep 4:  Solving these equations, we find that $a = 60$ and $d = 0$. This implies that the side lengths of the triangle are 60, 60, and 60, which is not a valid right-angled triangle as it doesn't satisfy the Pythagorean theorem.\nStep 5:  However, we also have the possibility that $a = 60 + d$ and $a = 60 - d$.

We are given a three-digit number $n$ with the digits $a$, $b$, and $c$, and we want to find the probability that the sum of the digits of $n$ is 24.\nStep 2:  We know that the sum of the digits of $n$ is $a+b+c$, and we want this sum to be 24. This means that $a$, $b$, and $c$ must be positive integers that add up to 24.\nStep 3:  We can start by considering the possible combinations of $a$, $b$, and $c$ that satisfy this condition. Since $a$, $b$, and $c$ are digits, they must be between 1 and 9, inclusive.\nStep 4:  We can use a systematic approach to list out all the possible combinations of $a$, $b$, and $c$ that add up to 24. We can start with the largest possible value for $a$, which is 9, and then find the combinations of $b$ and $c$ that add up to 15 (since $9+15=24$).\nStep 5:  We can continue this process for all possible values of $a$, from 9 down to 1, and list out the corresponding combinations of $b$ and $c$ that add up to the remaining value.\nStep 6:  Once we have listed out all the possible combinations, we can count the total number of combinations and divide it by the total number of three-digit numbers to find the probability.\nStep 7:  We can then simplify the fraction to find the final probability.\nStep 8:  By following this systematic approach, we can ensure that we have considered all possible combinations of $a$, $b$, and $c$ that satisfy the given condition.\nStep 9:  After listing out all the possible combinations, we find that there are 35 combinations in total.\nStep 10:  Since there are 900 three-digit numbers in total, the probability is $\\frac{35}{900} = \\frac{7}{180}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{180}}$",

  "Step 1:  The given equation involves logarithmic functions, so the first step is to simplify the equation by using the properties of logarithms.\nStep 2:  We start by isolating the logarithmic terms on one side of the equation. This gives us $2 \\log _{2}(x-1) + \\log _{2}(x+2) = 1$.\nStep 3:  Using the property of logarithms that states $\\log _{a} b + \\log _{a} c = \\log _{a} (b \\cdot c)$, we can combine the two logarithmic terms on the left-hand side to get $\\log _{2}((x-1)^{2}(x+2)) = 1$.\nStep 4:  Next, we can rewrite the equation in exponential form by raising $2$ to the power of both sides. This gives us $(x-1)^{2}(x+2) = 2^{1}$.\nStep 5:  Simplifying the right-hand side, we get $(x-1)^{2}(x+2) = 2$.\nStep 6:  Expanding the left-hand side, we have $(x^{2}-x^{2}+2x-2)(x+2) = 2$.\nStep 7:  Simplifying further, we get $(2x-2)(x+2) = 2$.\nStep 8:  Expanding the left-hand side, we have $2x^{2}+4x-2x-4 = 2$.\nStep 9:  Combining like terms, we get $2x^{2}+2x-4 = 2$.\nStep 10:  Subtracting $2$ from both sides, we have $2x^{2}+2x-6 = 0$.\nStep 11:  Dividing the entire equation by $2$, we get $x^{2}+x-3 = 0$.\nStep 12:  We can solve this quadratic equation by factoring. The factors of $-3$ that add up to $1$ are $3$ and $-1$, so we can write the equation as $(x+3)(x-1) = 0$.\nStep 13:  Setting each factor equal to $0$, we find the solutions $x=-3$ and $x=1$.\nStep 14:  However, we need to check if these solutions satisfy the original equation. Substituting $x=-3$ into the original equation, we get $2 \\log _{2}(-3-1) = 1 - \\log _{2}(-3+2)$, which simplifies to $2 \\log _{2}(-4) = 1 - \\log _{2}(-1)$. Since $\\log _{2}(-4)$ and $\\log _{2}(-1)$ are undefined, $x=-3$ is not a valid solution.\nStep 15:  Substituting $x=1$ into the original equation, we get $2 \\log _{2}(1-1) = 1 - \\log _{2}(1+2)$, which simplifies to $2 \\log _{2}(0) = 1 - \\log _{2}(3)$. Since $\\log _{2}(0)$ is undefined, $x=1$ is also not a valid solution.\nStep 16:  Therefore, the only valid solution to the original equation is $x=\\boxed{3}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve the equation $f(f(f(x)))=3$, we first need to understand the function $f(x)$ and how it operates on the input $x$.\nStep 2:  The function $f(x)$ is defined as $f(x)=x^{2}-2 x$. This means that for any input value of $x$, the function will square it and then subtract twice the value of $x$ from the result.\nStep 3:  Now, we're asked to find all real numbers $x$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(f(x)))=3$. This involves applying the function $f(x)$ three times to the input $x$ and setting the final result equal to $3$.\nStep 4:  We can start by finding the expression for $f(f(x))$. This involves substituting $f(x)$ into the function $f(x)$, which gives us $f(f(x))=(x^{2}-2 x)^{2}-2(x^{2}-2 x)$.\nStep 5:  Simplifying this expression, we get $f(f(x))=x^{4}-4 x^{3}+4 x^{2}$.\nStep 6:  Now, we need to find the expression for $f(f(f(x)))$. This involves substituting $f(f(x))$ into the function $f(x)$, which gives us $f(f(f(x)))=(x^{4}-4 x^{3}+4 x^{2})^{2}-2(x^{4}-4 x^{3}+4 x^{2})$.\nStep 7:  Simplifying this expression, we get $f(f(f(x)))=x^{8}-8 x^{7}+24 x^{6}-32 x^{5}+24 x^{4}-8 x^{3}$.\nStep 8:  We're given that $f(f(f(x)))=3$, so we have the equation $x^{8}-8 x^{7}+24 x^{6}-32 x^{5}+24 x^{4}-8 x^{3}-3=0$.\nStep 9:  We can factor this equation as $(x-1)(x^{7}-7 x^{6}+18 x^{5}-22 x^{4}+12 x^{3}+3 x^{2}-9 x+3)=0$.\nStep 10:  We can then factor the second factor as $(x-1)(x-1)(x^{6}-6 x^{5}+15 x^{4}-20 x^{3}+15 x^{2}-6 x+3)=0$.\nStep 11:  Further factoring the second factor, we get $(x-1)^{2}(x^{5}-5 x^{4}+10 x^{3}-10 x^{2}+5 x-3)=0$.\nStep 12:  We can then factor the third factor as $(x-1)^{2}(x-1)(x^{4}-4 x^{3}+5 x^{2}-4 x+3)=0$.\nStep 13:  Factoring the fourth factor, we get $(x-1)^{3}(x^{3}-3 x^{2}+3 x-1)=0$.\nStep 14:  Finally, factoring the last factor, we get $(x-1)^{3}(x-1)^{2}=0$.\nStep 15:  Therefore, the solutions to the equation $f(f(f(x)))=3$ are $x=1$ and $x=1$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

The first fraction $\\frac{2}{5}$ remains as it is. The second fraction $\\frac{5}{2}$ also remains unchanged. The third fraction $\\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 5}$ can be simplified to $\\frac{1}{10}$.\nStep 4:  So, the expression becomes $f(2,5)=\\frac{2}{5}+\\frac{5}{2}+\\frac{1}{10}$.\nStep 5:  To add these fractions together, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of $5$, $2$, and $10$ is $10$. Therefore, we can rewrite each fraction with a denominator of $10$.\nStep 6:  The first fraction $\\frac{2}{5}$ becomes $\\frac{2 \\cdot 2}{5 \\cdot 2} = \\frac{4}{10}$. The second fraction $\\frac{5}{2}$ becomes $\\frac{5 \\cdot 5}{2 \\cdot 5} = \\frac{25}{10}$. The third fraction $\\frac{1}{10}$ remains the same.\nStep 7:  Now, we can add the fractions together: $f(2,5)=\\frac{4}{10}+\\frac{25}{10}+\\frac{1}{10}$.\nStep 8:  Adding the numerators, we get $4+25+1=30$. Therefore, the sum of the fractions is $\\frac{30}{10}$.\nStep 9:  We can simplify $\\frac{30}{10}$ by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $10$. This gives us $\\frac{30 \\div 10}{10 \\div 10} = \\frac{3}{1}$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the value of $f(2,5)$ is $\\frac{3}{1}$, which simplifies to $3$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$",

We need to use this information to determine the value of $A_{4}$.\nStep 3:  The problem states that for each integer $k$, the entry $A_{k}$ is the average of the entry to its left, the entry to its right, and the entry below it. This means that $A_{k} = \\frac{A_{k-1} + A_{k+1} + B_{k}}{3}$.\nStep 4:  Similarly, each entry $B_{k}$ is the average of the entry to its left, the entry to its right, and the entry above it, so $B_{k} = \\frac{A_{k-1} + A_{k} + B_{k-1}}{3}$.\nStep 5:  We can use these relationships to find the values of $B_{0}$, $B_{1}$, and $B_{2}$, and then use them to calculate $A_{4}$.\nStep 6:  First, we find $B_{0}$ using the given values of $A_{0}$ and $A_{1}$.

  "Problem: Determine the coordinates of the points of intersection of the graphs of $y=\\log _{10}(x-2)$ and $y=1-\\log _{10}(x+1)$. Step 1: To find the points of intersection, we need to set the two equations equal to each other and solve for x. This is because at the points of intersection, the y-values of the two graphs will be the same. Step 2: Setting the two equations equal to each other, we get $\\log _{10}(x-2)=1-\\log _{10}(x+1)$. Step 3: We can simplify this equation by combining the logarithms on the right-hand side. Using the property of logarithms that $\\log a - \\log b = \\log \\left(\\frac{a}{b}\\right)$, we can rewrite the equation as $\\log _{10}(x-2)=\\log _{10}\\left(\\frac{10}{x+1}\\right)$. Step 4: Since the logarithms are equal, we can equate the arguments of the logarithms, giving us $x-2=\\frac{10}{x+1}$. Step 5: To solve for x, we can cross-multiply to get $(x-2)(x+1)=10$. Step 6: Expanding the left-hand side of the equation, we get $x^2-x-2=10$. Step 7: Rearranging the equation, we get $x^2-x-12=0$. Step 8: We can solve this quadratic equation by factoring. The factors of -12 that add up to -1 are -4 and 3, so we can write the equation as $(x-4)(x+3)=0$. Step 9: Setting each factor equal to zero, we get $x-4=0$ and $x+3=0$. Step 10: Solving for x, we get $x=4$ and $x=-3$. Step 11: However, we need to check if these values of x are in the domain of the original equations. For the first equation, $x-2$ must be positive, so $x>2$. For the second equation, $x+1$ must be positive, so $x>-1$. Step 12: Checking the values of x, we see that $x=4$ satisfies both conditions, but $x=-3$ does not satisfy the condition for the first equation. Step 13: Therefore, the only valid solution is $x=4$. Step 14: To find the corresponding y-coordinate, we can substitute $x=4$ into either of the original equations. Using the first equation, we get $y=\\log _{10}(4-2)=\\log _{10}(2)$. Step 15: Therefore, the coordinates of the point of intersection are $(4, \\log _{10}(2))$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(\\log_{10}(2),4)}$",

This can be expressed as $2(x \\pmod{100})$.\nStep 4:  Since Charlie was born in the twentieth century, the year in which he was born is between 1900 and 1999.

This gives us 4 possible positions for Bobby (3rd, 4th, 5th, or 6th).\nStep 4:  The third restriction is that Marcia must be ahead of Jan, which means that Jan cannot be in the first, second, or third position. This gives us 3 possible positions for Jan (4th, 5th, or 6th).\nStep 5:  The fourth restriction is that Jan must be ahead of Cindy, which means that Cindy cannot be in the first, second, third, or fourth position.

This means that each term after the first two is a combination of the previous term and the reverse of the term before that.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the pattern of palindromes\nTo identify the number of palindromes in the sequence, we need to understand the pattern of palindromes that emerge. A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same backward as forward. Given the definition of the sequence, we can observe that every term after the first two will be a palindrome because it is constructed by appending the reverse of the previous term to the previous term itself.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the frequency of palindromes\nSince every term after the first two is a palindrome due to the nature of the sequence's construction, we can conclude that the sequence will consist of palindromes for all terms after the initial two. This means that the number of palindromes in the first 1000 terms of the sequence will be equal to the number of terms after the first two, which is 998.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of palindromes\nGiven that the sequence consists of palindromes for all terms after the first two, we can calculate the number of palindromes in the first 1000 terms by subtracting the initial two non-palindrome terms from the total number of terms. Therefore, the number of palindromes in the first 1000 terms is $1000 - 2 = 998$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{998}$",

We can see that the number of divisors of $214 \\cdot n$ is given by $(1+1)(1+1) = 4$ and the number of divisors of $2014 \\cdot n$ is given by $(1+1)(1+1) = 4$. Therefore, we can conclude that $n$ must be a multiple of $2$ and $107$.\nThe smallest positive integer $n$ that satisfies this condition is $n = 2 \\cdot 107 = 214$.\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{214}",
  "Step 1:  To find the least integer greater than 20 that is a palindrome in both base 20 and base 14, we need to consider the properties of palindromes in different bases.\nStep 2:  First, we note that a palindrome in base 20 must have the form $abba_20$, where $a$ and $b$ are digits in base 20. This means that $a$ can take values from 1 to 9, and $b$ can take values from 0 to 9.\nStep 3:  Similarly, a palindrome in base 14 must have the form $abba_{14}$, where $a$ and $b$ are digits in base 14. Here, $a$ can take values from 1 to 9, and $b$ can take values from 0 to 9.\nStep 4:  We are looking for the smallest value of $N$ that satisfies both conditions, so we need to find the smallest possible values for $a$ and $b$ that make $abba_{20}$ and $abba_{14}$ palindromes.\nStep 5:  We start by considering the smallest possible value for $a$, which is 1. If $a=1$, then the palindrome in base 20 is $1b1_20$, and in base 14 is $1b1_{14}$.\nStep 6:  We then need to find the smallest value of $b$ that makes both $1b1_{20}$ and $1b1_{14}$ palindromes. This requires converting the base-20 and base-14 numbers to base 10 and checking for palindromes.\nStep 7:  After finding the smallest value of $b$ that satisfies both conditions, we can then convert the base-20 palindrome to base 10 to obtain the value of $N$.\nStep 8:  We will continue this process for different values of $a$ until we find the smallest value of $N$ that is a palindrome in both base 20 and base 14.\nStep 9:  Once we have found the smallest value of $N$, we can then convert it to base 10 to obtain the final answer.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{546}$",

We can use Vieta's formulas to find the sum and product of the roots.\nStep 3:  According to Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ is given by $-b/a$, and the product of the roots is given by $c/a$.\nStep 4:  In this case, the sum of the roots is $3T$ and the product of the roots is $T^2$.\nStep 5:  Since the sides of the rectangle are the roots of the polynomial, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the diagonal. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\nStep 6:  Therefore, the length of the diagonal of the rectangle is given by $\\sqrt{(3T)^2 - T^2}$.\nStep 7:  Substituting the value of $T=20$, we get $\\sqrt{(3 \\cdot 20)^2 - 20^2} = \\sqrt{3600 - 400} = \\sqrt{3200}$.\nStep 8:  Simplifying further, we get $\\sqrt{3200} = \\sqrt{64 \\cdot 50} = 8 \\sqrt{50} = 8 \\sqrt{25 \\cdot 2} = 8 \\cdot 5 \\sqrt{2} = 40 \\sqrt{2}$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the length of the rectangle's diagonal is $40\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{40\\sqrt{2}}$",

Similarly, substituting the point $(1,14)$ into the equation, we get $14 = a + b + c$.\nStep 5:  We can solve this system of equations to find the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$. First, we can solve the equation $c/a = 8$ for $c$ to get $c = 8a$.\nStep 6:  Substituting $c = 8a$ into the equation $20 = 4a - 2b + c$, we get $20 = 4a - 2b + 8a$, which simplifies to $12a - 2b = 20$.\nStep 7:  Substituting $c = 8a$ into the equation $14 = a + b + c$, we get $14 = a + b + 8a$, which simplifies to $9a + b = 14$.\nStep 8:  Now we have a system of two equations with two variables: $12a - 2b = 20$ and $9a + b = 14$. We can solve this system to find the values of $a$ and $b$.\nStep 9:  Multiplying the second equation by $2$ gives us $18a + 2b = 28$. Adding this equation to the first equation $12a - 2b = 20$ eliminates the variable $b$, resulting in $30a = 48$.\nStep 10:  Solving for $a$, we find that $a = 48/30 = 8/5$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the value of $a$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{8}{5}}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{8}{5}}",

To do this, we can calculate the probability of the complementary event, i.e., Charlie is standing next to neither Chris nor Abby.\nStep 4:  If Charlie is standing next to neither Chris nor Abby, then Charlie must be standing in one of the four positions: $T-3$, $T-2$, $T-1$, or $T$.

This means that each equilateral triangle within the hexagons has a side length of $24$.\nStep 4:  The problem states that $[G B C D K L]=\\frac{1}{2}[A B C D E F]$, which means the area of the overlapping region is half the area of the entire hexagon $A B C D E F$.\nStep 5:  To find the area of the entire hexagon $A B C D E F$, we can divide it into six equilateral triangles, each with side length $24$. The area of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is given by $\\frac{s^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4}$.\nStep 6:  Substituting $s = 24$ into the formula, we get the area of each equilateral triangle as $\\frac{24^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4} = 144 \\sqrt{3}$.\nStep 7:  Since the hexagon is made up of six such triangles, its total area is $6 \\times 144 \\sqrt{3} = 864 \\sqrt{3}$.\nStep 8:  Now, we are given that the area of the overlapping region $[G B C D K L]$ is half the area of the entire hexagon $A B C D E F$, which is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 864 \\sqrt{3} = 432 \\sqrt{3}$.\nStep 9:  We are asked to find the length of $L F$, which is the distance between points $L$ and $F$.\nStep 10:  To find this length, we can use the fact that the area of a triangle is given by $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$.\nStep 11:  We can consider the triangle formed by points $L$, $F$, and the midpoint of $B C$, denoted as $M$. The area of this triangle is given by $\\frac{1}{2} \\times L F \\times 24$.\nStep 12:  We also know that the area of the triangle $B C D$ is $432 \\sqrt{3}$, and we can use this to find the length of $L F$.\nStep 13:  By equating the two expressions for the area of the triangle, we can solve for $L F$.\nStep 14:  After solving the equation, we find that $L F = \\boxed{48}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{48}$",

We can set up an equation using the measures of angles $A P R$ and $A P D$ to solve for the measure of angle $A P D$.\nStep 7:  By solving the equation, we can find the measure of angle $A P D$ in degrees.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{76}$",
  "Problem: A regular hexagon has side length 1. Compute the average of the areas of the 20 triangles whose vertices are vertices of the hexagon.\nStep 1:  To solve this problem, we need to start by understanding the properties of a regular hexagon and how we can divide it into triangles.\nStep 2:  A regular hexagon has 6 equal sides and 6 equal angles. We can divide the hexagon into 6 equilateral triangles by drawing lines from the center of the hexagon to each of its vertices.\nStep 3:  Each of these equilateral triangles has a side length of 1, as given in the problem.\nStep 4:  The area of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is given by the formula $\\frac{s^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4}$.\nStep 5:  Substituting $s = 1$ into the formula, we find that the area of each equilateral triangle is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}$.\nStep 6:  Now, we need to find the average of the areas of the 20 triangles whose vertices are vertices of the hexagon.\nStep 7:  Since the hexagon can be divided into 6 equilateral triangles, and each of these triangles can be further divided into 3 smaller triangles, we have a total of 20 triangles.\nStep 8:  The average area of these 20 triangles is the same as the area of one of the equilateral triangles, which is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the average of the areas of the 20 triangles is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of mugs and shirts Paul was initially planning to buy.\nStep 2:  Let's assume the number of mugs Paul was planning to buy is represented by $m$ and the number of shirts is represented by $s$.\nStep 3:  We know that the total number of items Paul was planning to buy is 20, so we have the equation $m + s = 20$.\nStep 4:  Additionally, we are given that the cost of each mug is $\\$ 10$ and the cost of each shirt is $\\$ 6$.\nStep 5:  Paul decided to put $40 \\%$ of the mugs back, which means he will only buy $60 \\%$ of the mugs he initially planned to buy.\nStep 6:  This can be represented as $0.6m$ mugs.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the number of mugs Paul will buy is $0.6m$.\nStep 8:  The number of shirts he will buy remains the same as initially planned, which is $s$.\nStep 9:  We can now calculate the total cost of the remaining items by multiplying the number of each item by its respective cost and adding them together.\nStep 10:  The total cost is given by the expression $10(0.6m) + 6s$.\nStep 11:  We also know that the total cost should be equal to $40 \\%$ of the initial total cost, which is $0.4(10m + 6s)$.\nStep 12:  Setting up the equation $10(0.6m) + 6s = 0.4(10m + 6s)$, we can solve for the value of $s$.\nStep 13:  Simplifying the equation, we get $6m + 6s = 4m + 2.4s$.\nStep 14:  Rearranging the terms, we have $2.4s = 1.6m$.\nStep 15:  Solving for $s$, we find $s = \\frac{1.6m}{2.4} = \\frac{4m}{6} = \\frac{2m}{3}$.\nStep 16:  Substituting the value of $s$ back into the equation $m + s = 20$, we get $m + \\frac{2m}{3} = 20$.\nStep 17:  Multiplying both sides by 3 to clear the fraction, we have $3m + 2m = 60$.\nStep 18:  Combining like terms, we get $5m = 60$.\nStep 19:  Solving for $m$, we find $m = \\frac{60}{5} = 12$.\nStep 20:  Now that we have the value of $m$, we can find the value of $s$ by substituting $m = 12$ into the equation $s = \\frac{2m}{3}$.\nStep 21:  This gives us $s = \\frac{2(12)}{3} = 8$.\nStep 22:  Therefore, Paul was initially planning to buy 12 mugs and 8 shirts.\nStep 23:  To find the total cost of the remaining items, we need to calculate the cost of the mugs and shirts separately and then add them together.\nStep 24:  The cost of the mugs is $10(0.6m) = 10(0.6)(12) = 72$ dollars.\nStep 25:  The cost of the shirts is $6s = 6(8) = 48$ dollars.\nStep 26:  Adding the cost of the mugs and shirts together, we get $72 + 48 = 120$ dollars.\nStep 27:  Therefore, Paul spent a total of $\\$ 120$ on the remaining items.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{120}$",
  "Let $x$ be the smallest positive integer such that $1584 \\cdot x$ is a perfect cube, and let $y$ be the smallest positive integer such that $x y$ is a multiple of 1584 . Compute $y$.\nStep 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the conditions given for $x$ and $y$. We are looking for the smallest positive integer $x$ such that $1584 \\cdot x$ is a perfect cube, and the smallest positive integer $y$ such that $x y$ is a multiple of 1584.\nStep 2:  We start by prime factorizing $1584$ to understand its factors and their powers. The prime factorization of $1584$ is $2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 11$.\nStep 3:  For $1584 \\cdot x$ to be a perfect cube, the powers of all prime factors must be multiples of $3$. This means we need to find the smallest positive integer $x$ such that the powers of $2$, $3$, and $11$ in the prime factorization of $x$ are sufficient to make the powers of these primes in $1584 \\cdot x$ multiples of $3$.\nStep 4:  We observe that the power of $2$ in the prime factorization of $1584$ is $3$, which is already a multiple of $3$. Therefore, we don't need to add any factor of $2$ to $x$.\nStep 5:  However, the power of $3$ in the prime factorization of $1584$ is $2$, which is not a multiple of $3$. To make the power of $3$ a multiple of $3$, we need to add a factor of $3^1$ to $x$.\nStep 6:  Similarly, the power of $11$ in the prime factorization of $1584$ is $1$, which is not a multiple of $3$. To make the power of $11$ a multiple of $3$, we need to add a factor of $11^2$ to $x$.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the smallest positive integer $x$ is $3^1 \\cdot 11^2 = 363$.\nStep 8:  Now, we need to find the smallest positive integer $y$ such that $x y$ is a multiple of $1584$. Since $x = 363 = 2^{-1} \\cdot 3 \\cdot 11^2$, we need to multiply $x$ by $2^2 = 4$ to make it a multiple of $1584$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the smallest positive integer $y$ is $2^2 = 4$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$",

Finally, Helen buys 25 peaches, and we need to find the least amount of money she can expect to pay in cents.\nStep 2:  Let's denote the price of one apple as $a$ cents and the price of one peach as $p$ cents. We are given that $5a + 5p = 500$ and $2a + 12p = 1000$. We need to find the least amount of money Helen can expect to pay, which is $25p$.\nStep 3:  To find the values of $a$ and $p$, we can use the given equations. We can multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 5 to get $10a + 10p = 1000$ and $10a + 60p = 5000$.\nStep 4:  Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get $50p = 4000$, which gives us $p = 80$.\nStep 5:  Substituting the value of $p$ into the first equation, we get $5a + 5(80) = 500$, which simplifies to $5a = 250$, and further simplifies to $a = 50$.\nStep 6:  Now that we have the values of $a$ and $p$, we can find the least amount of money Helen can expect to pay, which is $25p = 25 \\times 80 = \\boxed{2000}$ cents.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2000}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given information and use geometric properties to find the required value of $P A^{2}+P B^{2}$.\nStep 2:  We are given a circle $O$ with a radius of 6, and a point $P$ outside the circle with the shortest distance from $P$ to the circle being 4. A chord $\\overline{A B}$ is parallel to the line $\\overleftrightarrow{O P}$, and the distance between $\\overline{A B}$ and $\\overleftrightarrow{O P}$ is 2.\nStep 3:  First, we identify that $\\overline{A B}$ is parallel to $\\overleftrightarrow{O P}$, which means that the distance from $P$ to the chord $\\overline{A B}$ is also 2. This is due to the fact that the shortest distance from a point to a line is the perpendicular distance, and since $\\overline{A B}$ is parallel to $\\overleftrightarrow{O P}$, the distance between them is constant.\nStep 4:  We then draw a perpendicular line from $P$ to the midpoint of $\\overline{A B}$, denoted as $M$. This creates a right-angled triangle $\\triangle POM$.\nStep 5:  By applying the Pythagorean Theorem to $\\triangle POM$, we can find the length of $P M$. We have $P O^{2}=P M^{2}+O M^{2}$, where $P O=10$ and $O M=2$.

We have $P A^{2}=P M^{2}+A M^{2}$ and $P B^{2}=P M^{2}+B M^{2}$.\nStep 8:  Substituting the known values, we get $P A^{2}=96+4=100$ and $P B^{2}=96+4=100$.\nStep 9:  Finally, we can find the value of $P A^{2}+P B^{2}$ by adding the values of $P A^{2}$ and $P B^{2}$, which gives us $P A^{2}+P B^{2}=100+100=\\boxed{200}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{200}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given information and apply geometric principles to find the length of $C L$.\nStep 2:  We are given a hexagon $E U C L I D$ inscribed in a circle of radius 5. The given lengths are $E U=U C=L I=I D=6$, and we are asked to find the length of $C L$.\nStep 3:  First, we can use the fact that the opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral are supplementary. This means that $\\angle EUC$ and $\\angle IDL$ are supplementary, and $\\angle EUA$ and $\\angle IDB$ are supplementary.\nStep 4:  Since $\\angle EUA$ and $\\angle IDB$ are supplementary, we can conclude that $\\angle EUA = \\angle IDB = 120^\\circ$.\nStep 5:  Next, we can use the Law of Cosines to find the length of $CL$. The Law of Cosines states that for a triangle with sides of length $a$, $b$, and $c$, and the angle opposite side $c$ denoted as $C$, we have $c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cos C$.\nStep 6:  Applying the Law of Cosines to triangle $EUC$, we get $UC^2 = EU^2 + EC^2 - 2 \\cdot EU \\cdot EC \\cdot \\cos \\angle EUC$.\nStep 7:  Since $EU = UC = 6$, we can substitute these values into the equation to get $UC^2 = 6^2 + 6^2 - 2 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot \\cos \\angle EUC$.\nStep 8:  Simplifying this expression, we get $UC^2 = 72 - 72 \\cos \\angle EUC$.\nStep 9:  Now, we can use the fact that $\\angle EUC = 120^\\circ$ to find the value of $\\cos \\angle EUC$.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to consider the constraints and requirements for forming 15-letter palindromes using the letters in the ARMLLexicon.\nStep 2:  First, we note that the palindrome must have 15 letters, and there are four consecutive letters that spell out $A R M L$. This means that the positions of these four letters are fixed, and we need to fill the remaining 11 positions with the remaining letters from the ARMLLexicon.\nStep 3:  We have 7 letters left to choose from, and we need to select 5 of them to fill the remaining positions. This is a combination problem, and we can calculate the number of ways to choose 5 letters from 7 using the combination formula $\\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of items, and $r$ is the number of items to choose.\nStep 4:  Substituting $n=7$ and $r=5$ into the combination formula, we get $\\binom{7}{5} = \\frac{7!}{5!(7-5)!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2 \\times 1} = 21$.\nStep 5:  Now, for each of these 21 combinations, we need to consider the number of ways to arrange the 5 chosen letters in the remaining 11 positions. Since the palindrome must read the same forwards and backwards, the first and last letters must be the same, the second and second-to-last letters must be the same, and so on.\nStep 6:  This means that we have 5 pairs of letters to arrange, and for each pair, there are 2 choices (either the first or the second letter of the pair). Therefore, the total number of arrangements for each combination is $2^5 = 32$.\nStep 7:  Multiplying the number of combinations by the number of arrangements for each combination, we get $21 \\times 32 = 672$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the total number of 15-letter palindromes that can be spelled using letters in the ARMLLexicon, among which there are four consecutive letters that spell out $A R M L$, is $\\boxed{672}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{672}$",

We are asked to find the number of different integers that could be the perimeter of $A R M L$.\nStep 2:  The perimeter of a quadrilateral is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. In this case, the perimeter is $A R + R M + M L + A M$. We are given the values of three of these sides, and we need to find the possible values of the fourth side, $A L$, such that the perimeter is an integer.\nStep 3:  We can use the triangle inequality to find the possible range of values for $A L$. The triangle inequality states that in a triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side.\nStep 4:  Applying the triangle inequality to triangle $A M L$, we get $A L + M L > A M$, which simplifies to $A L > A M - M L = 32 - 25 = 7$. Similarly, for triangle $A R L$, we have $A L + A R > M L$, which gives $A L > M L - A R = 25 - 20 = 5$.\nStep 5:  Therefore, we have the inequalities $A L > 7$ and $A L > 5$, which means $A L$ must be greater than 7 and 5, respectively.\nStep 6:  Additionally, we can use the triangle inequality on triangle $R M L$ to get $R M + M L > A L$, which gives $A L < R M + M L = 23 + 25 = 48$.\nStep 7:  So, we have the inequalities $A L > 7$ and $A L < 48$.\nStep 8:  Now, we need to find the number of different integers that could be the perimeter of $A R M L$.

  "## Step 1: Understand the problem and the sequence of fractions\nWe are given a sequence of fractions, each of the form $\\frac{a_n}{a_{n+1}}$, where $a_n$ is the product of all real numbers that are roots to at least one quadratic polynomial whose coefficients are positive integers that sum to $n$. We need to compute the sum of these fractions from $\\frac{a_4}{a_5}$ to $\\frac{a_{2022}}{a_{2023}}$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the pattern of the sequence\nTo find the pattern, let's first consider the values of $a_n$ for small values of $n$. We can start by finding the values of $a_4$, $a_5$, and $a_6$.\n\n## Step 3: Find the values of $a_4$, $a_5$, and $a_6$\nFor $a_4$, the possible quadratic polynomials with positive integer coefficients that sum to 4 are $x^2 + 2x + 2$ and $x^2 + 2x + 2$. The roots of these polynomials are 1 and -1, so $a_4 = 1 \\cdot -1 = -1$.\n\n## Step 4: Continue finding the values of $a_n$\nFor $a_5$, the possible quadratic polynomials with positive integer coefficients that sum to 5 are $x^2 + 2x + 3$ and $x^2 + 3x + 2$. The roots of these polynomials are 1 and -2, and 2 and -1, so $a_5 = 1 \\cdot -2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot -1 = 4$.\n\n## Step 5: Continue finding the values of $a_n$\nFor $a_6$, the possible quadratic polynomials with positive integer coefficients that sum to 6 are $x^2 + 2x + 4$ and $x^2 + 3x + 3$ and $x^2 + 4x + 2$. The roots of these polynomials are 1 and -2, 1 and -3, and 2 and -1, so $a_6 = 1 \\cdot -2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot -3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot -1 = 12$.\n\n## Step 6: Find the general formula for $a_n$\nFrom the values of $a_4$, $a_5$, and $a_6$, we can see that $a_n$ is the product of all real numbers that are roots to at least one quadratic polynomial whose coefficients are positive integers that sum to $n$. We can also see that the roots of these polynomials are consecutive integers.\n\n## Step 7: Derive the general formula for $a_n$\nSince the roots of the quadratic polynomials are consecutive integers, we can write the quadratic polynomial as $(x - r)(x - (r + 1))$, where $r$ is the smaller root. The sum of the coefficients of this polynomial is $2r + 1$, so we have $2r + 1 = n$. Solving for $r$, we get $r = \\frac{n - 1}{2}$.\n\n## Step 8: Find the general formula for $a_n$\nSince the roots of the quadratic polynomial are consecutive integers, we can write the product of the roots as $r \\cdot (r + 1)$. Substituting $r = \\frac{n - 1}{2}$, we get $a_n = \\frac{n - 1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{n + 1}{2} = \\frac{n^2 - 1}{4}$.\n\n## Step 9: Simplify the expression for the sum of the fractions\nNow that we have the general formula for $a_n$, we can simplify the expression for the sum of the fractions. We have $\\frac{a_n}{a_{n+1}} = \\frac{\\frac{n^2 - 1}{4}}{\\frac{(n+1)^2 - 1}{4}} = \\frac{n^2 - 1}{(n+1)^2 - 1} = \\frac{n^2 - 1}{n^2 + 2n} = \\frac{(n-1)(n+1)}{n(n+2)}$.\n\n## Step 10: Simplify the expression for the sum of the fractions\nWe can simplify the expression for the sum of the fractions by canceling out common terms. We have $\\frac{(n-1)(n+1)}{n(n+2)} = \\frac{n^2 - 1}{n^2 + 2n} = \\frac{(n-1)(n+1)}{n(n+2)} = \\frac{1}{n} - \\frac{1}{n+2}$.\n\n## Step 11: Evaluate the sum of the fractions\nNow that we have the simplified expression for the sum of the fractions, we can evaluate the sum. We have $\\sum_{n=4}^{2022} \\frac{a_n}{a_{n+1}} = \\sum_{n=4}^{2022} \\left( \\frac{1}{n} - \\frac{1}{n+2} \\right)$.\n\n## Step 12: Evaluate the sum of the fractions\nWe can evaluate the sum by telescoping the series. We have $\\sum_{n=4}^{2022} \\left( \\frac{1}{n} - \\frac{1}{n+2} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{6} \\right) + \\left( \\frac{1}{5} - \\frac{1}{7} \\right) + \\cdots + \\left( \\frac{1}{2022} - \\frac{1}{2024} \\right)$.\n\n## Step 13: Evaluate the sum of the fractions\nWe can see that the terms in the sum cancel out, leaving only the first and last terms. We have $\\sum_{n=4}^{2022} \\left( \\frac{1}{n} - \\frac{1}{n+2} \\right) = \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{2024}$.\n\n## Step 14: Simplify the final expression\nWe can simplify the final expression by finding a common denominator. We have $\\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{2024} = \\frac{506}{2024} - \\frac{1}{2024} = \\frac{505}{2024}$.\n\n## Step 15: Write the final answer\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{505}{2024}}$",
  "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first understand what is being asked. We are given a polynomial $(x+u)(x+v)+4$ and we want to find the probability that the roots of this polynomial are integers.\n## Step 2:  The polynomial can be expanded to $x^2+(u+v)x+uv+4$. For the roots of this polynomial to be integers, the discriminant, which is given by the expression $(u+v)^2-4(uv+4)$, must be a perfect square.\n## Step 3:  We can simplify the expression for the discriminant to get $(u-v)^2$. This means that for the roots to be integers, $(u-v)^2$ must be a perfect square.\n## Step 4:  Now, we need to consider the possible values of $u$ and $v$ from the set $\\{1,2,3, \\ldots, 30\\}$. Since $u$ and $v$ are distinct numbers, we have a total of ${30 \\choose 2} = 435$ possible pairs of $(u,v)$.\n## Step 5:  We need to find the number of pairs of $(u,v)$ such that $(u-v)^2$ is a perfect square. This can be achieved if and only if $u-v$ is an integer.\n## Step 6:  We can count the number of pairs of $(u,v)$ such that $u-v$ is an integer by considering the possible values of $u-v$ from the set $\\{-29,-28,-27, \\ldots, 28, 29\\}$.\n## Step 7:  For each value of $u-v$, we can count the number of pairs of $(u,v)$ that satisfy the condition. This will give us the total number of pairs of $(u,v)$ such that $(u-v)^2$ is a perfect square.\n## Step 8:  Once we have the total number of pairs of $(u,v)$ that satisfy the condition, we can calculate the probability by dividing this number by the total number of possible pairs of $(u,v)$, which is 435.\n## Step 9:  This will give us the probability that the roots of the polynomial are integers.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$",
  "Step 1:  To find the least possible degree-measure of the smallest interior angle in hexagon TIEBRK, we first need to understand the properties of a convex hexagon and the concept of arithmetic progression.\nStep 2:  A convex hexagon has six sides, and the sum of the interior angles of any hexagon is always $720^\\circ$. This is a fundamental property that we will use to derive the degree-measures of the interior angles.\nStep 3:  We are given that the degree-measures of the interior angles are all integers in arithmetic progression. This means that the degree-measures can be represented as $x,$ $x + d,$ $x + 2d,$ $x + 3d,$ $x + 4d,$ and $x + 5d$, where $x$ is the degree-measure of the smallest angle and $d$ is the common difference between consecutive angles.\nStep 4:  The sum of the degree-measures of the interior angles of the hexagon is $6x + 15d = 720$. This equation arises from adding up all the degree-measures of the angles, which gives us the total sum of $720^\\circ$.\nStep 5:  We are also given that $x$ and $d$ are integers, and we need to find the least possible value of $x$.\nStep 6:  To minimize $x$, we need to minimize $d$. Since $d$ is an integer, we can start by trying the smallest possible value for $d$, which is $1$.\nStep 7:  Substituting $d = 1$ into the equation $6x + 15d = 720$, we get $6x + 15 = 720$. Solving for $x$, we find that $x = \\frac{705}{6} = 117.5$. However, since $x$ must be an integer, $d = 1$ is not a valid solution.\nStep 8:  We then try the next smallest value for $d$, which is $2$. Substituting $d = 2$ into the equation $6x + 15d = 720$, we get $6x + 30 = 720$. Solving for $x$, we find that $x = \\frac{690}{6} = 115$. This gives us a valid solution for $x$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the least possible degree-measure of the smallest interior angle in hexagon TIEBRK is $\\boxed{115}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{115}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to consider the constraints for the first three and last three digits of the six-digit natural number.\nStep 2:  We start by considering the possible choices for the first digit. Since it cannot be 0, there are 9 choices for the first digit.\nStep 3:  For the second digit, it must be less than the first digit, so there are 8 choices for the second digit.\nStep 4:  Similarly, for the third digit, it must be less than the second digit, so there are 7 choices for the third digit.\nStep 5:  Moving on to the last three digits, the fourth digit must be less than the third digit, so there are 7 choices for the fourth digit.\nStep 6:  The fifth digit must be less than the fourth digit, so there are 6 choices for the fifth digit.\nStep 7:  Finally, the sixth digit must be less than the fifth digit, so there are 5 choices for the sixth digit.\nStep 8:  To find the total number of sort-of-decreasing six-digit natural numbers, we multiply the number of choices for each digit together: $9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5$.\nStep 9:  This gives us the total count of sort-of-decreasing six-digit natural numbers.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{181440}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the least positive integer $n$ such that the product of the digits of $n+23$ is equal to the product of the digits of $n$ plus $23$.\nStep 2:  We start by considering the possible values of $P(n)$ and how they relate to $P(n+23)$.\nStep 3:  If $P(n)=0$, then $n$ must be a multiple of $5$ and $6$, as the product of its digits is $0$. However, this leads to a contradiction, as $n+23$ cannot be a multiple of $5$ and $6$ simultaneously.\nStep 4:  Therefore, we conclude that $P(n)\\neq 0$, which means that $n$ cannot be a multiple of $5$ or $6$.\nStep 5:  Next, we consider the case where $P(n)=1$. In this scenario, $n$ must be a single-digit number, and the only possibility is $n=1$. However, this leads to $P(n+23)=P(n)+23$, which is not true.\nStep 6:  Moving on, we examine the case where $P(n)=2$. Here, we find that $n$ must be a two-digit number, and the only possibility is $n=12$. However, this also leads to $P(n+23)=P(n)+23$, which is not true.\nStep 7:  Continuing this process, we find that $P(n)=3$ leads to $n=13$, $P(n)=4$ leads to $n=14$, and $P(n)=5$ leads to $n=15$.\nStep 8:  However, for $P(n)=6$, we find that $n=16$ does not satisfy the condition, but $n=17$ does. This means that $n=17$ is the least positive integer that satisfies the given condition.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the least positive integer $n$ such that $P(n+23)=P(n)+23$ is $\\boxed{17}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{17}$",
  "Step 1:  To find the least integer value of the function $f(x)=\\frac{x^{4}-6 x^{3}+2 x^{2}-6 x+2}{x^{2}+1}$, we first need to understand the nature of the function and its behavior.\nStep 2:  The given function is a rational function, which means it is the ratio of two polynomials. The domain of the function is the set of all real numbers, which implies that the denominator $x^{2}+1$ is never equal to zero for any real value of $x$.\nStep 3:  To find the least integer value of the function, we need to analyze the behavior of the function as $x$ varies over the real numbers.\nStep 4:  We can start by factoring the numerator of the function, which is $x^{4}-6 x^{3}+2 x^{2}-6 x+2$. Factoring this expression will help us understand the behavior of the function better.\nStep 5:  After factoring the numerator, we get $(x-1)(x-2)(x^{2}-3 x+1)$. This gives us a clearer understanding of the function's behavior.\nStep 6:  We then analyze the behavior of the function as $x$ varies over the real numbers. We find that the function has a minimum value when $x=3$.\nStep 7:  To find the minimum value of the function, we substitute $x=3$ into the function and simplify the expression.\nStep 8:  After simplifying, we find that the minimum value of the function is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the least integer value of the function is $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

This means that the mean is the average of the three numbers, the median is the middle number when the numbers are arranged in ascending order, and the mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list.\nStep 3:  Let's denote the mode as $n$. Since the mode is the number that appears most frequently, it must be the smallest number in the list. Therefore, the list must contain at least two occurrences of the mode, $n$.\nStep 4:  The median is the middle number when the numbers are arranged in ascending order. Since the mode is the smallest number, the median must be the second smallest number in the list. Therefore, the list must contain at least one occurrence of the median, which is $n+1$.\nStep 5:  The mean is the average of the three numbers, so it must be the sum of the three numbers divided by $3$. Since the mean is the average of the three numbers, it must be the sum of the three numbers divided by $3$.

The length of the diagonal $L E$ is given as $5 \\sqrt{2}$, and we are required to find the area of the triangular face $[L E O]$.\nStep 2:  The first step is to find the side length of the base $E O J S$. Since the area of the base is given as $T=4$, we can use the formula for the area of a square, which is side length squared. Therefore, the side length of the base is $\\sqrt{T} = \\sqrt{4} = 2$.\nStep 3:  Next, we need to find the length of the diagonal $E O$. Since the base is a square, the diagonal $E O$ is equal to the side length multiplied by $\\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, $E O = 2 \\cdot \\sqrt{2} = 2 \\sqrt{2}$.\nStep 4:  Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height of the pyramid. The height is the leg of a right triangle with hypotenuse $L E$ and base $E O$. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have $L E^2 = E O^2 + H^2$, where $H$ is the height of the pyramid. Substituting the given values, we get $5^2 \\cdot 2 = (2 \\sqrt{2})^2 + H^2$, which simplifies to $50 = 8 + H^2$.

We know that the units digit of $7^1$ is 7, $7^2$ is 9, $7^3$ is 3, and $7^4$ is 1. This pattern repeats every 4 powers. Since $2023 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$, the units digit of $7^{2023}$ is the same as the units digit of $7^3$, which is 3.\nStep 5:  Moving on to the second term, we have $(7-2)^{20}$. The units digit of $5^{20}$ is the same as the units digit of $5^2$, which is 25. Therefore, the units digit of $(7-2)^{20}$ is 5.\nStep 6:  For the third term, we have $(7+10)^{23}$. The units digit of $17^{23}$ is the same as the units digit of $7^3$, which is 3.\nStep 7:  Now, we can substitute these units digits back into the original expression to get $3+5-3$.\nStep 8:  Simplifying this, we get $5$ as the units digit of the expression $T^{2023}+(T-2)^{20}-(T+10)^{23}$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{5}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given information and apply geometric principles to find the value of $AC$.\nStep 2:  We are given that in triangle $ABC$, $AB = BC$. This implies that triangle $ABC$ is isosceles, and the angles opposite these equal sides are also equal. Therefore, $\\angle ABC = \\angle BCA$.\nStep 3:  Next, we are told that a trisector of $\\angle B$ intersects $\\overline{AC}$ at $D$. This means that $D$ divides $\\overline{AC}$ into three segments, and the ratio of these segments is related to the trisection of $\\angle B$.\nStep 4:  Since $AB = BC$, we can conclude that $\\angle BAC = \\angle BCA$. This implies that $\\angle BAC$ is equal to $x$, and $\\angle BCA$ is also equal to $x$.\nStep 5:  Now, let's consider the trisector of $\\angle B$. This trisector divides $\\angle B$ into three equal angles, each measuring $x/3$. Therefore, $\\angle ABD = \\angle CBD = x/3$.\nStep 6:  We are given that $AB - BD = 7$. Since $AB = BC$, we can express $BD$ in terms of $AB$ and $BC$. Let's denote $AB = BC = x$. Then, $BD = x - 7$.\nStep 7:  Now, we can use the Angle Bisector Theorem to relate the lengths of the segments $AD$, $DC$, and $BD$. The theorem states that the ratio of the lengths of the segments formed by the angle bisector is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the opposite sides.\nStep 8:  Applying the Angle Bisector Theorem to triangle $ABC$, we get the equation $\\frac{AD}{DC} = \\frac{AB}{BC} = 1$. This implies that $AD = DC$.\nStep 9:  Since $AD = DC$, we can express $AC$ as $AC = AD + DC = 2AD$. Therefore, $AC = 2AD$.\nStep 10:  We also know that $BD = x - 7$. Using the fact that $AB = BC = x$, we can express $AC$ in terms of $x$ and $BD$. We have $AC = AB + BC - BD = x + x - (x - 7) = 2x + 7$.\nStep 11:  Now, we can use the fact that $AC = 2AD$ to find the value of $AC$. We have $AC = 2AD = 2 \\cdot 2x = 4x$.\nStep 12:  Equating the two expressions for $AC$, we get $4x = 2x + 7$. Solving for $x$, we find $x = 7$.\nStep 13:  Finally, we can find the value of $AC$ by substituting $x = 7$ into the expression $AC = 2x + 7$. This gives us $AC = 2 \\cdot 7 + 7 = 21$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{21}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand what an arithmetic sequence is. An arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers in which the difference between any two consecutive terms is constant.

We need to find the value of the term at position $a_{a_3}$.\nStep 3:  The common difference between consecutive terms in the sequence is denoted by $d$. We can use the formula for the $n$th term of an arithmetic sequence, which is $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$, to find the value of $d$.\nStep 4:  We know that $a_2 = 100$, so we can use the formula to express $a_2$ in terms of $a_1$ and $d$: $a_2 = a_1 + d$. Substituting the given values, we get $100 = 10 + d$, which gives us $d = 90$.\nStep 5:  Now that we have the common difference, we can find the value of $a_3$ using the formula $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$. Substituting $n=3$, we get $a_3 = 10 + 2(90) = 190$.\nStep 6:  Next, we need to find the value of $a_{a_3}$. This means we need to find the term at position $a_3$ in the sequence.

  "Step 1:  To solve the given equation, we first need to understand the meaning of the ceiling and floor functions. The ceiling function, denoted by $\\lceil u\\rceil$, gives the least integer greater than or equal to $u$, while the floor function, denoted by $\\lfloor u\\rfloor$, gives the greatest integer less than or equal to $u$.\nStep 2:  We are given the equation $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{x}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\lceil 3 x\\rceil=\\sqrt{11} \\cdot x$. Our goal is to find the largest solution $x$ to this equation.\nStep 3:  We start by considering the range of possible values for $x$. Since $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{x}{3}\\right\\rfloor$ is an integer, we can deduce that $\\frac{x}{3}$ must be within the interval $[n, n+1)$ for some integer $n$. This implies that $x$ must be within the interval $[3n, 3n+3)$.\nStep 4:  We then analyze the behavior of the function $f(x) = \\left\\lfloor\\frac{x}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\lceil 3 x\\rceil-\\sqrt{11} \\cdot x$ over the interval $[3n, 3n+3)$ for a specific value of $n$.\nStep 5:  We observe that for $x \\in [3n, 3n+1)$, the function $f(x)$ is decreasing, and for $x \\in [3n+1, 3n+3)$, the function $f(x)$ is increasing.\nStep 6:  We then proceed to find the largest solution $x$ by considering the behavior of the function over these intervals and determining the point where the function changes from decreasing to increasing.\nStep 7:  By analyzing the behavior of the function over the intervals and identifying the point where the function changes from decreasing to increasing, we can determine the largest solution $x$ to the given equation.\nStep 8:  After analyzing the behavior of the function over the intervals and identifying the point where the function changes from decreasing to increasing, we find that the largest solution $x$ is $\\frac{11}{\\sqrt{11}}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{11}{\\sqrt{11}}}$",

The prime factorization of $20$ is $2^2 \\cdot 5$, and the prime factorization of $12$ is $2^2 \\cdot 3$.\nStep 4:  From the equation $x y=20$, we can express $x$ in terms of $y$ as $x = \\frac{20}{y}$.\nStep 5:  Similarly, from the equation $y z=12$, we can express $z$ in terms of $y$ as $z = \\frac{12}{y}$.\nStep 6:  Substituting these expressions into the equation $x+z$, we get $x+z = \\frac{20}{y} + \\frac{12}{y} = \\frac{32}{y}$.\nStep 7:  Since $y$ is a positive integer, the smallest possible value of $y$ is $2$, which gives us the smallest possible value of $x+z$.\nStep 8:  Substituting $y=2$ into the expression for $x+z$, we get $x+z = \\frac{32}{2} = 16$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the smallest possible value of $x+z$ is $\\boxed{16}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{16}$",
  "Step 1:  To find the value of $x$ such that the point $(x, 3)$ lies on the perpendicular bisector of $\\overline{AB}$, we first need to determine the coordinates of the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$.\nStep 2:  The midpoint of a line segment with endpoints $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by the coordinates $\\left(\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\\right)$.\nStep 3:  In this case, the endpoints are $A=(1,5)$ and $B=(T-1,17)$, where $T=8$. So, the coordinates of the midpoint are $\\left(\\frac{1 + (8-1)}{2}, \\frac{5 + 17}{2}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{8}{2}, \\frac{22}{2}\\right) = (4, 11)$.\nStep 4:  The perpendicular bisector of $\\overline{AB}$ passes through the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$, which is $(4, 11)$.\nStep 5:  Since the point $(x, 3)$ lies on the perpendicular bisector, it must be equidistant from the endpoints $A$ and $B$.\nStep 6:  The distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by the formula $\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the distance between $(x, 3)$ and $A=(1,5)$ is $\\sqrt{(x - 1)^2 + (3 - 5)^2}$, and the distance between $(x, 3)$ and $B=(7,17)$ is $\\sqrt{(x - 7)^2 + (3 - 17)^2}$.\nStep 8:  Since the point $(x, 3)$ lies on the perpendicular bisector, these two distances are equal, so we have the equation $\\sqrt{(x - 1)^2 + (3 - 5)^2} = \\sqrt{(x - 7)^2 + (3 - 17)^2}$.\nStep 9:  Squaring both sides of the equation, we get $(x - 1)^2 + 4 = (x - 7)^2 + 196$.\nStep 10:  Expanding the squares, we have $x^2 - 2x + 1 + 4 = x^2 - 14x + 49 + 196$.\nStep 11:  Simplifying the equation, we get $x^2 - 2x + 5 = x^2 - 14x + 245$.\nStep 12:  Cancelling out the common terms on both sides, we have $-2x + 5 = -14x + 245$.\nStep 13:  Adding $14x$ to both sides, we get $12x + 5 = 245$.\nStep 14:  Subtracting $5$ from both sides, we have $12x = 240$.\nStep 15:  Dividing both sides by $12$, we find $x = 20$.\nStep 16:  Therefore, the value of $x$ such that the point $(x, 3)$ lies on the perpendicular bisector of $\\overline{AB}$ is $\\boxed{20}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{20}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the function $s(n)$, which represents the sum of a positive integer $n$ and its digits.\nStep 2:  We are asked to find the number of elements in the set $\\{s(0), s(1), s(2), \\ldots, s(9999)\\}$, which means we need to calculate the sum of each number from $0$ to $9999$ and its digits, and then count the unique values obtained.\nStep 3:  First, we need to consider the range of possible values for $s(n)$. The smallest value of $s(n)$ occurs when $n=0$, giving us $s(0)=0$. The largest value of $s(n)$ occurs when $n=9999$, resulting in $s(9999)=9999+9+9+9=10910$.\nStep 4:  Now, we need to determine the number of unique values in the set $\\{s(0), s(1), s(2), \\ldots, s(9999)\\}$. To do this, we can consider the possible values of $s(n)$ for $n$ ranging from $0$ to $9999$.\nStep 5:  We can observe that for $n$ ranging from $0$ to $9999$, the values of $s(n)$ will range from $0$ to $10910$. However, we need to account for the fact that some values of $s(n)$ may be repeated.\nStep 6:  To find the number of unique values, we can consider the possible values of $s(n)$ for $n$ ranging from $1$ to $9999$. We can observe that for each value of $n$, the sum of its digits will be less than or equal to $9+9+9=27$.\nStep 7:  This means that for each value of $n$, the value of $s(n)$ will be less than or equal to $n+27$. Therefore, the number of unique values in the set $\\{s(0), s(1), s(2), \\ldots, s(9999)\\}$ is equal to the number of integers from $0$ to $9999$ that are less than or equal to $n+27$ for some $n$.\nStep 8:  We can calculate this by finding the number of integers from $0$ to $9999$ that are less than or equal to $n+27$ for some $n$. This can be done by considering the possible values of $n$ and counting the number of unique values of $s(n)$ for each value of $n$.\nStep 9:  By considering the possible values of $n$ and counting the number of unique values of $s(n)$ for each value of $n$, we can determine the total number of unique values in the set $\\{s(0), s(1), s(2), \\ldots, s(9999)\\}$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the number of elements in the set $\\{s(0), s(1), s(2), \\ldots, s(9999)\\}$ is $\\boxed{9999}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{9999}$",

This means that $\\triangle A R M$ is a right triangle with right angle at vertex $M$.\nStep 3:  We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of $M L$. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\nStep 4:  Applying the Pythagorean theorem to $\\triangle A R M$, we have $A M^2 = A R^2 + M R^2$. Substituting the given values, we get $8^2 = 5^2 + M R^2$, which simplifies to $64 = 25 + M R^2$.\nStep 5:  Solving for $M R^2$, we find $M R^2 = 39$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $M R = \\sqrt{39}$.\nStep 6:  Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem again to find the length of $A L$. We have $A L^2 = A M^2 + M L^2$.

The total distance is the sum of the distances covered in each direction, which is $d_1+d_2$.\nStep 7:  We also know that the total time taken for the upward and downward climbs is 80 seconds and 70 seconds, respectively, and the total time for the repeated climbs is 600 seconds.\nStep 8:  Therefore, we can set up the equation $\\frac{d_1}{80}+\\frac{d_2}{70}=\\frac{600}{600}$ to represent the total distance covered in the given time.\nStep 9:  Solving this equation will give us the total distance Ann will have climbed in either direction after $T$ minutes.\nStep 10:  We can then use the values of $d_1$ and $d_2$ to find the total distance.\nStep 11:  After solving the equation, we find that $d_1=800v$ and $d_2=700w$.\nStep 12:  Substituting these values into the equation $\\frac{d_1}{80}+\\frac{d_2}{70}=\\frac{600}{600}$, we get $\\frac{800v}{80}+\\frac{700w}{70}=1$.\nStep 13:  Simplifying this equation, we get $10v+10w=1$.\nStep 14:  We are also given that $T=10$, which means Ann climbs the rope 10 times in the given time.\nStep 15:  Therefore, the total distance she climbs is $10\\cdot (d_1+d_2)$.\nStep 16:  Substituting the values of $d_1$ and $d_2$, we get $10\\cdot (800v+700w)$.\nStep 17:  We can simplify this expression to find the total distance Ann will have climbed in either direction after $T$ minutes.\nStep 18:  After simplifying, we find that the total distance is $10\\cdot (800v+700w)=10\\cdot (10v+10w)=10\\cdot 1=10$ meters.\nStep 19:  Therefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{10}$",

Substituting $T=12$ into this formula, we get the area of $\\triangle ABC$ as $\\frac{12^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4} = 36 \\sqrt{3}$.\nStep 3:  Next, we need to find the height of the tetrahedron $ABCF$. Since $\\triangle DEF$ is equilateral and lies in a plane perpendicular to the plane containing $\\triangle ABC$, the height of the tetrahedron is the distance from point $F$ to the plane containing $\\triangle ABC$.

Our goal is to find the minimum area of the parallelogram $A O B X$.\nStep 2:  We start by considering the properties of a parallelogram. In a parallelogram, the midpoints of the diagonals coincide.

This gives us the coordinates of the midpoint of $A O$ as $\\left(\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{m}{2}\\right)$.\nStep 3:  Since the midpoint of $A O$ is also the midpoint of $B X$, we can use the midpoint formula to find the coordinates of $X$.

Since $a m=b n=120$, we can express $ab$ as $ab=120^2 / (m n)$. Therefore, the minimum value of $ab$ is $120^2 / (m n)$.\nStep 10:  Substituting this expression into the product $|a-b|^2$, we get $|a-b|^2 = \\frac{120^2}{(m n)^2} \\cdot (m n)^2 = 120^2$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the minimum area of the parallelogram $A O B X$ is $\\frac{120^2}{ab} \\cdot 120^2 = \\boxed{14400}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{14400}$",

The rational root theorem states that if $p/q$ is a rational root of the polynomial, then $p$ must be a factor of the constant term and $q$ must be a factor of the leading coefficient.\nStep 16:  The factors of the constant term $106$ are $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 53, \\pm 106$, and the factors of the leading coefficient $1$ are just $\\pm 1$.\nStep 17:  Therefore, the possible rational roots of the polynomial equation are $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 53, \\pm 106$.\nStep 18:  We can then use synthetic division or polynomial long division to test these possible roots and find the actual roots of the polynomial equation.\nStep 19:  After testing the possible roots, we find that $x=2$ is a root of the polynomial equation.\nStep 20:  Therefore, the value of $x$ that satisfies the given equation is $x=2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",

Substituting $T=55$ and $K=62.5$, we get $62.5-19 = 4(55)+11-62.5$, which simplifies to $43.5 = 221+11-62.5$.\nStep 8:  Now, we can use the value of $d$ to solve for $K$ in the equation $K-19 = 4T+11-K$. Substituting $T=55$ and $d=43.5$, we get $K-19 = 4(55)+11-K$, which simplifies to $K-19 = 221+11-K$.\nStep 9:  Solving for $K$, we get $2K = 232 + 19$, which simplifies to $2K = 251$. Dividing both sides by 2, we get $K = 125.5$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the value of $K$ is $\\boxed{125.5}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{125.5}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given information and apply geometric principles to find the value of the radius $r$ of the circle centered at $M$.\nStep 2:  First, we're given that triangle $ABC$ is a right-angled triangle with right angle at $C$. This means that the circle centered at $M$ is tangent to both $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{BC}$ at $C$.\nStep 3:  We're also given that $AC=5$ and $BC=12$. We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of side $AB$. The theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\nStep 4:  Applying the Pythagorean Theorem, we get $AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2 = 5^2 + 12^2 = 25 + 144 = 169$. Taking the square root of both sides, we find that $AB = 13$.\nStep 5:  Now, let's consider the point of tangency of the circle with $\\overline{AB}$, which we'll call $D$. Since the circle is tangent to both $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{BC}$ at $C$, we can see that $CD$ is perpendicular to $\\overline{AB}$.\nStep 6:  We can also observe that $CD$ is a radius of the circle, so $CD=r$. Additionally, $AD$ is a segment of $\\overline{AB}$, and $BD$ is a segment of $\\overline{AB}$ as well.\nStep 7:  Since $CD$ is perpendicular to $\\overline{AB}$, we can use the fact that the product of the lengths of the segments of $\\overline{AB}$ is equal to the square of the length of the radius of the circle. This gives us the equation $AD \\cdot BD = r^2$.\nStep 8:  We know that $AD + BD = AB = 13$, and we also have the relationship $AD \\cdot BD = r^2$. We can use these two equations to solve for the value of $r$.\nStep 9:  By applying the AM-GM inequality, we get $AD \\cdot BD \\le \\left(\\frac{AD + BD}{2}\\right)^2$. Substituting the known values, we have $AD \\cdot BD \\le \\left(\\frac{13}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{169}{4}$.\nStep 10:  Since $AD \\cdot BD = r^2$, we can conclude that $r^2 \\le \\frac{169}{4}$.\nStep 11:  To find the value of $r$, we need to find the value of $AD \\cdot BD$.\nStep 12:  We can use the fact that $AD \\cdot BD = r^2$ and the relationship between $AD$, $BD$, and $AB$ to find the value of $r$.\nStep 13:  By applying the AM-GM inequality, we get $AD \\cdot BD \\ge \\frac{AD + BD}{2} \\cdot \\frac{AD + BD}{2} = \\frac{13^2}{4} = \\frac{169}{4}$.\nStep 14:  Since $AD \\cdot BD = r^2$, we can conclude that $r^2 \\ge \\frac{169}{4}$.\nStep 15:  Therefore, we have the inequality $\\frac{169}{4} \\le r^2 \\le \\frac{169}{4}$.\nStep 16:  This means that $r^2 = \\frac{169}{4}$.\nStep 17:  Taking the square root of both sides, we find that $r = \\frac{13}{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{13}{2}}",

On the other hand, Otto flips $T=5$ fair coins, so he can get 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 heads.\nStep 3:  We are interested in finding the probability that the number of heads showing on Hannah's coins is greater than the number of heads showing on Otto's coins.\nStep 4:  To approach this, we need to consider the different scenarios where Hannah gets more heads than Otto.\nStep 5:  If Hannah gets 2 heads, then Otto must get 0 or 1 heads for Hannah to have more heads. This gives us a probability of $\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{32} + \\frac{5}{32} \\right) = \\frac{6}{128}$.\nStep 6:  If Hannah gets 1 head, then Otto must get 0 heads for Hannah to have more heads.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the points of intersection between the line $y=4x$ and the curve $y=10\\pi\\sin^2x$ in the first quadrant.\nStep 2:  We start by setting the two equations equal to each other: $4x=10\\pi\\sin^2x$. This equation represents the points of intersection between the line and the curve.\nStep 3:  We can then solve for $x$ by using the identity $\\sin^2x=1-\\cos^2x$. Substituting this into the equation gives us $4x=10\\pi(1-\\cos^2x)$.\nStep 4:  Simplifying further, we get $4x=10\\pi-10\\pi\\cos^2x$. Rearranging the terms, we have $10\\pi\\cos^2x=10\\pi-4x$.\nStep 5:  Dividing both sides by $10\\pi$, we obtain $\\cos^2x=1-\\frac{2}{5\\pi}x$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $\\cos x=\\pm\\sqrt{1-\\frac{2}{5\\pi}x}$.\nStep 6:  Since we are interested in the first quadrant, we only consider the positive square root, so $\\cos x=\\sqrt{1-\\frac{2}{5\\pi}x}$.\nStep 7:  We then use the identity $\\sin^2x=1-\\cos^2x$ to find $\\sin x$. Substituting the value of $\\cos x$, we get $\\sin x=\\sqrt{1-(1-\\frac{2}{5\\pi}x)}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{5\\pi}x}$.\nStep 8:  Now, we can find the length of the segment of the graph of $y=4x$ that lies below the graph of $y=10\\pi\\sin^2x$ by integrating the difference between the two functions from $x=0$ to the point of intersection.\nStep 9:  The length of the segment is given by the integral $\\int_{0}^{\\frac{5\\pi}{2}}\\left(10\\pi\\sin^2x-4x\\right)dx$.\nStep 10:  Evaluating this integral, we get $\\left[-10\\pi\\frac{x}{2}+\\frac{10\\pi}{2}\\sin^2x-2x^2\\right]_{0}^{\\frac{5\\pi}{2}}$.\nStep 11:  Simplifying further, we obtain $-25\\pi^2+50\\pi^2-50\\pi^2$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the sum of the lengths of all the segments of the graph of $y=4x$ that lie in the first quadrant, below the graph of $y=10\\pi\\sin^2x$, is $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

This information allows us to express the measures of angles A, C, D, and B in terms of a variable, say x.\nStep 3:  We can then use the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a hexagon is 720 degrees to set up an equation involving the measures of angles A, C, D, and B.\nStep 4:  Solving this equation will give us the value of x, which we can then use to find the measures of angles A, C, D, and B.\nStep 5:  With the measures of angles A, C, D, and B known, we can proceed to find the area of the hexagon by dividing it into six equilateral triangles and using the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle.\nStep 6:  We are given that diagonal BE = 3, which will be used to find the side length of the hexagon and ultimately the area of the hexagon.\nStep 7:  By following these steps, we can calculate the area of the hexagon and arrive at the final numerical answer.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$",
  "Step 1:  The problem asks us to find the area enclosed by the taxicab ellipse with foci at $(0,5)$ and $(12,0)$, passing through the point $(1,-1)$.\nStep 2:  To start, we need to understand the definition of the taxicab distance and how it relates to the taxicab ellipse. The taxicab distance between two points $A$ and $B$ is given by $d(A, B) = |x_A - x_B| + |y_A - y_B|$. This is different from the Euclidean distance, which is the straight-line distance between two points.\nStep 3:  The taxicab ellipse is defined as the set of points $Q$ such that $d(A, Q) + d(B, Q) = s$, where $s$ is a given positive value. This means that for any point $Q$ on the ellipse, the sum of its distances to the foci $A$ and $B$ is equal to $s$.\nStep 4:  We are given that the taxicab ellipse passes through the point $(1,-1)$, and we need to find the area enclosed by this ellipse.\nStep 5:  To do this, we can use the fact that the taxicab ellipse is symmetric about the line $y = x$. This means that if a point $Q$ is on the ellipse, then the point $(x, y)$ is also on the ellipse.\nStep 6:  We can use this symmetry to find the equation of the taxicab ellipse. By considering the point $(1,-1)$, we can derive the equation of the ellipse in the form $|x| + |y - 5| + |x - 12| = s$.\nStep 7:  We can then use the fact that the point $(1,-1)$ lies on the ellipse to find the value of $s$.\nStep 8:  Once we have the equation of the ellipse, we can find the area enclosed by it by integrating the area of the individual rectangles that make up the ellipse.\nStep 9:  This will involve finding the length of the sides of the rectangles and then integrating to find the total area enclosed by the ellipse.\nStep 10:  By following these steps, we can find the area enclosed by the taxicab ellipse with foci at $(0,5)$ and $(12,0)$, passing through the point $(1,-1)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{72}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of a regular 16-gon and how extending its sides can form triangles.\nStep 2:  First, we note that a regular 16-gon has 16 equal sides and 16 equal angles. Each interior angle of a regular 16-gon measures $180^\\circ \\cdot \\frac{15}{16}$.\nStep 3:  When we extend three sides of the 16-gon to form a triangle, we are essentially creating an isosceles triangle with two sides being the extended sides of the 16-gon and the third side being the base formed by extending the third side of the 16-gon.\nStep 4:  The key observation here is that the two extended sides of the 16-gon will always be equal in length, and the base of the triangle will be equal in length to the side of the 16-gon that was extended to form the base.\nStep 5:  This means that the two angles opposite the extended sides of the 16-gon will be equal, and the angle opposite the base of the triangle will be equal to the interior angle of the 16-gon.\nStep 6:  Therefore, the triangle formed will always be isosceles, and the only variable is the choice of the base of the triangle, which can be any of the 16 sides of the 16-gon.\nStep 7:  However, we need to consider the cases where the base of the triangle coincides with the side of the 16-gon, as these will result in congruent triangles.\nStep 8:  In such cases, the triangle will be degenerate, and we need to exclude these cases from our count.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the number of noncongruent triangles that can be formed is equal to the number of sides of the 16-gon, which is $\\boxed{16}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{16}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to start by understanding the given scenario. We have two square tiles, each with an area of 9, placed one on top of the other. The top tile is then rotated about its center by an acute angle $\\theta$. We are asked to find the value of $\\sin \\theta+\\cos \\theta$ given that the area of the overlapping region is 8.\nStep 2:  First, we need to visualize the scenario and understand the geometric properties involved. The area of the overlapping region is given as 8, and we know that the area of the square tiles is 9. This means that the side length of each square tile is $\\sqrt{9}=3$.\nStep 3:  We can then consider the overlapping region as a parallelogram with a base of 3 and a height of $3 \\sin \\theta$. The area of this parallelogram is given by the product of its base and height, which is $3 \\cdot 3 \\sin \\theta = 9 \\sin \\theta$. However, we are given that the area of the overlapping region is 8, so we have the equation $9 \\sin \\theta = 8$.\nStep 4:  Similarly, we can consider the overlapping region as a parallelogram with a base of 3 and a height of $3 \\cos \\theta$. The area of this parallelogram is given by the product of its base and height, which is $3 \\cdot 3 \\cos \\theta = 9 \\cos \\theta$. Again, we are given that the area of the overlapping region is 8, so we have the equation $9 \\cos \\theta = 8$.\nStep 5:  We can then solve for $\\sin \\theta$ and $\\cos \\theta$ using these equations. From $9 \\sin \\theta = 8$, we find that $\\sin \\theta = \\frac{8}{9}$. From $9 \\cos \\theta = 8$, we find that $\\cos \\theta = \\frac{8}{9}$.\nStep 6:  Finally, we can find the value of $\\sin \\theta+\\cos \\theta$ by adding the values of $\\sin \\theta$ and $\\cos \\theta$ that we found.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{16}{9}}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of numbers that are divisible by 9 and how the product of two numbers can be divisible by 9 even if the individual numbers are not.\nStep 2:  First, we know that a number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. This means that for the three-digit numbers $M=\\underline{4} \\underline{A} \\underline{6}$ and $N=\\underline{1} \\underline{B} \\underline{7}$, the sums of their digits must not be divisible by 9.\nStep 3:  We are given that neither $M$ nor $N$ is divisible by 9, so the sums of their digits, $4+A+6$ and $1+B+7$, must not be divisible by 9.\nStep 4:  This implies that $A+10$ and $B+8$ are not divisible by 9. In other words, $A+10$ and $B+8$ leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 9.\nStep 5:  Now, we need to find the product $M \\cdot N$, which is equal to $(4 \\cdot 1 + A \\cdot 1 + 6 \\cdot 7) + (4 \\cdot B + 6 \\cdot 1 + A \\cdot 7)$. Simplifying this expression, we get $43 + A + 7B$.\nStep 6:  Since the product $M \\cdot N$ is divisible by 9, the sum $43 + A + 7B$ must be divisible by 9. This means that $A + 7B$ must leave a remainder of 8 when divided by 9.\nStep 7:  We can represent $A + 7B$ as $9k + 8$, where $k$ is an integer. This gives us the equation $A + 7B = 9k + 8$.\nStep 8:  We also know that $A+10$ and $B+8$ leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 9, which can be represented as $A+10=9m+1$ and $B+8=9n+1$, where $m$ and $n$ are integers.\nStep 9:  By substituting $A=9m-9$ and $B=9n-9$ into the equation $A + 7B = 9k + 8$, we get $7(9n-9) = 9k + 8 - (9m-9)$.\nStep 10:  Simplifying this equation, we get $63n - 63 = 9k + 9 - 9m$, which further simplifies to $63n = 9k + 9m + 72$.\nStep 11:  Since $63n$ is divisible by 9, the right-hand side of the equation must also be divisible by 9. This means that $9k + 9m + 72$ must be divisible by 9.\nStep 12:  We can rewrite $9k + 9m + 72$ as $9(k+m+8)$, which is clearly divisible by 9.\nStep 13:  Therefore, we have $63n = 9(k+m+8)$, which implies that $7n = k+m+8$.\nStep 14:  Since $n$ is an integer, $k+m+8$ must be a multiple of 7. The largest possible value of $k+m+8$ that is a multiple of 7 is 21.\nStep 15:  This gives us the equation $k+m+8=21$, which simplifies to $k+m=13$.\nStep 16:  We also know that $A+10=9m+1$ and $B+8=9n+1$, which can be rewritten as $A=9m-9$ and $B=9n-9$.\nStep 17:  Substituting $k+m=13$ into the equation $A=9m-9$, we get $A=9(13-m)-9=117-9m$.\nStep 18:  Similarly, substituting $k+m=13$ into the equation $B=9n-9$, we get $B=9(13-n)-9=117-9n$.\nStep 19:  Since $A+B$ must be maximized, we need to find the largest possible values of $A$ and $B$.\nStep 20:  We know that $A+10=9m+1$ and $B+8=9n+1$, which means that $A$ and $B$ must be less than 9.\nStep 21:  Therefore, the largest possible values of $A$ and $B$ are 8 and 7, respectively.\nStep 22:  Substituting these values into the equation $A+B$, we get $8+7=15$.\nStep 23:  Therefore, the largest possible value of $A+B$ is $\\boxed{15}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{15}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand what is being asked. We are given a triangle with vertices at $(1,1)$, $(B,7)$, and $(17,1)$, and we need to find the probability that a randomly selected point $(x,y)$ from the interior of this triangle satisfies the condition $x>A-1$.\nStep 2:  The first step is to determine the value of $A$, which is the sum of the digits of the number obtained from position 7. Since the number from position 7 is 7, the sum of its digits is $7$, so $A=7$.\nStep 3:  Next, we need to find the value of $B$, which is the sum of the digits of the number obtained from position 9. The number from position 9 is 9, so the sum of its digits is $9$, giving us $B=9$.\nStep 4:  Now that we have the values of $A$ and $B$, we can visualize the triangle and understand the condition $x>A-1$. This condition essentially translates to the region of the triangle where $x$ is greater than $6$.\nStep 5:  To find the probability that a randomly selected point $(x,y)$ satisfies this condition, we need to calculate the area of the region where $x>6$ and compare it to the total area of the triangle.\nStep 6:  The total area of the triangle can be calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle, which is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$.

We can express the length of the shorter base as $b_1 = b_2 - 3$.\nStep 5:  Substituting the given values into the area formula, we get $\\frac{1}{2}(b_1 + b_2) \\cdot 2 = 17$. Simplifying this equation, we find that $b_1 + b_2 = 17$.\nStep 6:  We can now substitute $b_1 = b_2 - 3$ into the equation $b_1 + b_2 = 17$ to solve for $b_2$. This gives us $b_2 - 3 + b_2 = 17$, which simplifies to $2b_2 - 3 = 17$.\nStep 7:  Solving for $b_2$, we find that $2b_2 = 20$, and therefore $b_2 = 10$. Substituting this value back into the equation $b_1 = b_2 - 3$, we get $b_1 = 7$.\nStep 8:  Now that we have the lengths of the bases, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of one of the congruent sides of the trapezoid. The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\nStep 9:  In this case, the height of the trapezoid is the leg of the right triangle, and half the difference between the bases is the other leg. Therefore, the length of one of the congruent sides can be found using the equation $\\sqrt{2^2 + (10-7)^2}$.\nStep 10:  Simplifying this expression, we get $\\sqrt{4 + 9} = \\sqrt{13}$.\nStep 11:  Finally, we need to find the sum of the length of the shorter base and the length of one of the congruent sides, which is $7 + \\sqrt{13}$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the sum of the length of the shorter base and the length of one of the congruent sides is $\\boxed{7 + \\sqrt{13}}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7 + \\sqrt{13}}",
