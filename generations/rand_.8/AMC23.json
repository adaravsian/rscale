  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance from City A where Alicia and Beth will meet when they both start biking towards each other at the same time.\nStep 2:  First, let's understand the situation: Cities A and B are 45 miles apart. Alicia starts biking from A towards B at 18 miles per hour, while Beth starts biking from B towards A at 12 miles per hour.\nStep 3:  Since they are moving towards each other, their combined speed is 18 + 12 = 30 miles per hour. This means that together, they are closing the distance between them at a rate of 30 miles per hour.\nStep 4:  The time it takes for them to meet can be found by dividing the total distance between them (45 miles) by their combined speed (30 miles per hour). So, time = distance / speed = 45 / 30 = 1.5 hours.\nStep 5:  Therefore, after 1.5 hours, they will meet. To find the distance from City A where they meet, we need to calculate how far Alicia has traveled in 1.5 hours.\nStep 6:  Since Alicia is biking at 18 miles per hour, in 1.5 hours, she will have covered a distance of 18 * 1.5 = 27 miles.\nStep 7:  Therefore, when they meet, Alicia will be 27 miles from City A.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{27}$",
  "Step 1: Problem Explanation\nWe are given two equations involving positive real numbers x and y: y^3 = x^2 and (y - x)^2 = 4y^2. We need to find the value of x + y.\n\nStep 2: \nTo solve this problem, we can start by manipulating the second equation to express x in terms of y. Then, substitute that expression into the first equation to solve for y. Once we have y, we can find x and then compute x + y.\n\nStep 3: \nFirst, let's expand the second equation: (y - x)^2 = 4y^2. This gives us y^2 - 2yx + x^2 = 4y^2. Rearranging terms, we get x^2 - 2yx - 3y^2 = 0.\n\nStep 4: \nNow, we can treat this as a quadratic equation in x. Let's use the quadratic formula: x = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a, where a = 1, b = -2y, and c = -3y^2. Plugging these values into the formula, we get x = (2y \u00b1 sqrt((-2y)^2 - 4(1)(-3y^2))) / 2(1). Simplifying, x = (2y \u00b1 sqrt(4y^2 + 12y^2)) / 2. This simplifies to x = (2y \u00b1 sqrt(16y^2)) / 2. Therefore, x = (2y \u00b1 4y) / 2. So, x = y or x = 3y.\n\nStep 5: \nNow, we have two possible values for x: x = y or x = 3y. We can substitute these into the first equation y^3 = x^2 to check which one is valid.\n\nStep 6: \nIf x = y, then substituting into y^3 = x^2 gives y^3 = y^2. Dividing both sides by y^2 (since y is positive), we get y = 1. So, if x = y, then x = y = 1.\n\nStep 7: \nIf x = 3y, then substituting into y^3 = x^2 gives y^3 = (3y)^2. Therefore, y^3 = 9y^2. Dividing both sides by y^2 (since y is positive), we get y = 9. So, if x = 3y, then x = 3(9) = 27, and y = 9.\n\nStep 8: \nTherefore, we have two possible solutions: (x, y) = (1, 1) or (x, y) = (27, 9). We need to check which one satisfies both original equations.\n\nStep 9: \nFor (x, y) = (1, 1), substituting into y^3 = x^2 gives 1^3 = 1^2, which is true. Substituting into (y - x)^2 = 4y^2 gives (1 - 1)^2 = 4(1)^2, which is 0 = 4, so this solution is not valid.\n\nStep 10: \nFor (x, y) = (27, 9), substituting into y^3 = x^2 gives 9^3 = 27^2. Therefore, 729 = 729, which is true. Substituting into (y - x)^2 = 4y^2 gives (9 - 27)^2 = 4(9)^2. Therefore, (-18)^2 = 4(81). So, 324 = 324, which is true. Therefore, (x, y) = (27, 9) is a valid solution.\n\nStep 11: \nTherefore, the valid solution is (x, y) = (27, 9). So, x + y = 27 + 9 = 36.\n\nStep 12: \nTherefore, the final answer is x + y = 36.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{36}",
  "Problem: What is the degree measure of the acute angle formed by lines with slopes $2$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$?\n\nStep 1: Recall that the acute angle between two lines can be found using the formula tan(\u03b8) = |(m1 - m2) / (1 + m1*m2)|, where m1 and m2 are the slopes of the lines.\n\nStep 2: Identify the slopes of the two lines: m1 = 2 and m2 = 1/3.\n\nStep 3: Plug the slopes into the formula: tan(\u03b8) = |(2 - 1/3) / (1 + 2*(1/3))|.\n\nStep 4: Simplify the expression inside the absolute value: (2 - 1/3) = (6/3 - 1/3) = 5/3, and (1 + 2*(1/3)) = (1 + 2/3) = (3/3 + 2/3) = 5/3.\n\nStep 5: Substitute the simplified expressions back into the formula: tan(\u03b8) = |(5/3) / (5/3)|.\n\nStep 6: Since the numerator and denominator are the same, the fraction simplifies to 1. Therefore, tan(\u03b8) = |1| = 1.\n\nStep 7: Since tan(\u03b8) = 1, the angle \u03b8 is 45 degrees.\n\nStep 8: However, the problem asks for the acute angle, which is the smaller angle between the two lines. Since the lines have slopes 2 and 1/3, which are both positive, the acute angle is the angle between them, which is 45 degrees.\n\nStep 9: Therefore, the degree measure of the acute angle formed by lines with slopes 2 and 1/3 is 45 degrees.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{45}",
  "Step 1: The problem presents a series of cubes with alternating signs. We need to compute the sum of this series from 2^3 to 18^3, with each term being the cube of an even number minus the cube of the preceding odd number.\n\nStep 2: The series starts with 2^3 - 1^3, then 4^3 - 3^3, and so on, until 18^3 - 17^3. The pattern is that each term is the cube of an even number minus the cube of the preceding odd number.\n\nStep 3: To simplify this, we can observe that the difference between consecutive cubes can be expressed as (n + 1)^3 - n^3, which is equal to 3n^2 + 3n + 1. Therefore, each term in the series can be written as (n + 1)^3 - n^3 = 3n^2 + 3n + 1.\n\nStep 4: So, the series can be rewritten as the sum of these differences from n = 1 to n = 9 (since 18 - 17 = 1, 16 - 15 = 1, and so on, until 2 - 1 = 1). Therefore, the sum is 3(1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2) + 9.\n\nStep 5: The sum of squares from 1 to 9 is 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 = 285.\n\nStep 6: Therefore, the total sum is 3(285) + 9 = 855 + 9 = 864.\n\nStep 7: So, the final answer is 864.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{864}",
  "Step 1: Let's denote the number of left-handed players as L and the number of right-handed players as R. We are given that R = 2L.\n\nStep 2: The total number of participants is L + R = L + 2L = 3L.\n\nStep 3: Each participant plays every other participant once. So, the total number of games played is the number of ways to choose two participants from the total number of participants, which is given by the combination formula C(n, 2) = n(n-1)/2, where n is the total number of participants. Therefore, the total number of games is 3L(3L-1)/2.\n\nStep 4: Let's denote the number of games won by left-handed players as G_L and the number of games won by right-handed players as G_R. We are given that G_L = 1.4G_R.\n\nStep 5: Since each game is played between two players, the total number of games won by left-handed players is the number of games played by left-handed players minus the number of games lost by left-handed players. Similarly, the total number of games won by right-handed players is the number of games played by right-handed players minus the number of games lost by right-handed players.\n\nStep 6: Let's denote the number of games played by left-handed players as P_L and the number of games played by right-handed players as P_R. Then, G_L = P_L - L*(3L - L - 1)/2 and G_R = P_R - R*(3L - R - 1)/2.\n\nStep 7: Since each participant plays every other participant once, the number of games played by left-handed players is the number of ways to choose two left-handed players, which is C(L, 2) = L(L-1)/2, plus the number of games played by left-handed players against right-handed players, which is L*R. Similarly, the number of games played by right-handed players is C(R, 2) = R(R-1)/2 plus L*R.\n\nStep 8: Therefore, P_L = L(L-1)/2 + L*R and P_R = R(R-1)/2 + L*R.\n\nStep 9: Substituting these expressions into the equations for G_L and G_R, we get:\n\nG_L = L(L-1)/2 + L*R -

  "Step 1: To solve the equation $z^5=\\overline{z}$, we first need to understand the properties of complex numbers and their conjugates. A complex number $z$ can be represented as $z = a + bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, and $i$ is the imaginary unit such that $i^2 = -1$. The conjugate of $z$, denoted as $\\overline{z}$, is given by $\\overline{z} = a - bi$. Therefore, the equation $z^5=\\overline{z}$ can be written as $(a + bi)^5 = a - bi$.\n\nStep 2: Let's express $z$ in polar form. The polar form of a complex number $z = a + bi$ is given by $z = re^{i\\theta}$, where $r$ is the magnitude of $z$ (i.e., $r = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$) and $\\theta$ is the argument of $z$ (i.e., $\\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{b}{a}\\right)$). Therefore, we can write $z = re^{i\\theta}$ and $\\overline{z} = re^{-i\\theta}$.\n\nStep 3: Substituting $z = re^{i\\theta}$ and $\\overline{z} = re^{-i\\theta}$ into the equation $z^5=\\overline{z}$, we get $(re^{i\\theta})^5 = re^{-i\\theta}$. Simplifying this, we have $r^5e^{5i\\theta} = re^{-i\\theta}$. Since $r$ is a real number, we can divide both sides by $r$ to get $r^4e^{5i\\theta} = e^{-i\\theta}$. Therefore, we have $r^4e^{5i\\theta} = e^{-i\\theta}$.\n\nStep 4: Since $r^4$ is a real number, we can equate the magnitudes and the arguments separately. The magnitudes are equal, so $r^4 = 1$. Therefore, $r = 1$ since $r$ is positive. The arguments are equal, so $5\\theta = -\\theta + 2k\\pi$, where $k$ is an integer. Therefore, $6\\theta = 2k\\pi$, so $\\theta = \\frac{k\\pi}{3}$.\n\nStep 5: Since $\\theta$ is the argument of $z$, it must lie in the interval $[0, 2\\pi)$. Therefore, we need to find the values of $k$ such that $\\frac{k\\pi}{3}$ lies in $[0, 2\\pi)$. This means $0 \\leq \\frac{k\\pi}{3} < 2\\pi$, so $0 \\leq k < 6$. Therefore, $k$ can take values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n\nStep 6: For each value of $k$, we can compute the corresponding value of $\\theta$ and then find the corresponding complex number $z = re^{i\\theta}$. Since $r = 1$, we have $z = e^{i\\theta}$. Therefore, the complex numbers satisfying the equation are $e^{i\\theta}$ for $\\theta = \\frac{k\\pi}{3}$, where $k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5$.\n\nStep 7: Therefore, the number of complex numbers satisfying the equation $z^5=\\overline{z}$ is equal to the number of values of $k$ in the interval $[0, 6)$. Since $k$ can take values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, there are 6 such values.\n\nStep 8: Therefore, the final answer is 6.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{6}",
  "Step 1: The problem asks us to find the maximum value of the imaginary part of a complex number z that satisfies the equation |1 + z + z^2| = 4. We need to express this maximum value in the form sqrt(m)/n, where m and n are relatively prime positive integers, and then find m + n.\n\nStep 2: To approach this problem, we can start by representing the complex number z in terms of its real and imaginary parts. Let's denote z = x + yi, where x and y are real numbers. Then, we can substitute this into the given equation |1 + z + z^2| = 4 and simplify.\n\nStep 3: Substituting z = x + yi into the equation |1 + z + z^2| = 4, we get |1 + (x + yi) + (x + yi)^2| = 4. Expanding (x + yi)^2 gives (x^2 - y^2) + 2xyi. So, the equation becomes |1 + (x + yi) + (x^2 - y^2 + 2xyi)| = 4.\n\nStep 4: Simplifying the expression inside the absolute value, we get |(1 + x + x^2 - y^2) + (2x + 2xy)i| = 4. The absolute value of a complex number a + bi is sqrt(a^2 + b^2). Therefore, we have sqrt((1 + x + x^2 - y^2)^2 + (2x + 2xy)^2) = 4.\n\nStep 5: Squaring both sides of the equation, we get (1 + x + x^2 - y^2)^2 + (2x + 2xy)^2 = 16. Expanding the left-hand side gives (1 + 2x + x^2 + x^4 - 2y^2 + 2x^2y^2 + 2x^3 - 2x^2y + 4x^2 + 4xy + 4x^2y + 4x^2y^2 + 4xy^2) = 16.\n\nStep 6: Simplifying the left-hand side, we have 1 + 2x + x^2 + x^4 - 2y^2 + 2x^2y^2 + 2x^3 - 2x^2y + 4x^2 + 4xy + 4x^2y + 4x^2y^2 + 4xy^2 = 16.\n\nStep 7: Rearranging the terms, we get x^4 + 2x^3 + 5x^2 + 2x + x^2y^2 + 2x^2y + 2xy^2 + 4xy + 4y^2 - 2y^2 + 1 = 16.\n\nStep 8: Simplifying further, we have x^4 + 2x^3 + 5x^2 + 2x + x^2y^2 + 2x^2y + 2xy^2 + 4xy + 2y^2 + 1 = 16.\n\nStep 9: Subtracting 16 from both sides, we get x^4 + 2x^3 + 5x^2 + 2x + x^2y^2 + 2x^2y + 2xy^2 + 4xy + 2y^2 - 15 = 0.\n\nStep 10: This is a quartic equation in x with coefficients depending on y. To find the maximum value of the imaginary part of z, we need to find the maximum value of y.\n\nStep 11: Since the equation is quartic in x, solving it directly might be difficult. However, we can use the fact that the maximum value of y occurs when the discriminant of the quartic equation is zero.\n\nStep 12: The discriminant of a quartic equation ax^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + e = 0 is given by \u0394 = 256a^3e^3 + 192a^2b^2e^2 + 128a^2c^2e^2 + 144a^2d^2e + 18a^2b^2c + 4a^2b^3 + 16a^2c^3 + 16a^2d^3 + 4a^3b^2c + 4a^3c^2d + 4a^3d^2e - 4a^4b^3 - 27a^4c^2 - 27a^4d^2 - 27a^4e^2.\n\nStep 13: In our case, the quartic equation is x^4 + 2x^3 + 5x^2 + 2x + x^2y^2 + 2x^2y + 2xy^2 + 4xy + 2y^2 - 15 = 0. The coefficients are a = 1, b = 2, c = 5, d = 2 + x^2y^2 + 2x^2y + 2xy^2 + 4xy + 2y^2, e = -15.\n\nStep 14: Substituting these coefficients into the discriminant formula, we get \u0394 = 256(1)^3(-15)^3 + 192(1)^2(2)^2(-15)^2 + 128(1)^2(5)^2(-15)^2 + 144(1)^2(2 + x^2y^2 + 2x^2y + 2xy^2 + 4xy + 2y^2)^2(-15) + 18(1)^2(2)^2(5) + 4(1)^2(2)^3 + 16(1)^2(5)^3 + 16(1)^2(2 + x^2y^2 + 2x^2y + 2xy^2 + 4xy + 2y^2)^3 + 4(1)^3(2)^2(5) + 4(1)^3(5)^2(2 + x^2y^2 + 2x^2y + 2xy^2 + 4xy + 2y^2) + 4(1)^3(2 + x^2y^2 + 2x^2y + 2xy^2 + 4xy + 2y^2)^2(-15) -

  "Step 1: Problem Explanation\nFlora the frog starts at 0 on the number line and makes a sequence of jumps to the right. Each jump is a positive integer distance m with probability 1/2^m. We need to find the probability that Flora will eventually land at 10.\n\nStep 2: \nTo solve this problem, we can use the concept of a random walk. Since Flora starts at 0 and jumps to the right, the position after each jump is a random variable. We can model this as a sequence of independent random variables, where each variable represents the distance of a jump. The probability of each jump is given by 1/2^m, where m is the distance of the jump.\n\nStep 3: \nThe problem asks for the probability that Flora will eventually land at 10. This means that we need to find the probability that the sum of all the jumps is equal to 10. Since each jump is a positive integer, the sum can be any positive integer. However, since Flora starts at 0, the sum must be at least 10.\n\nStep 4: \nTo compute this probability, we can use the fact that the probability of reaching a certain position in a random walk is equal to the probability of reaching that position in a single step, plus the probability of reaching that position in two steps, plus the probability of reaching that position in three steps, and so on.\n\nStep 5: \nLet's denote the probability of reaching position 10 as P(10). Then, P(10) = P(10 in one step) + P(10 in two steps) + P(10 in three steps) + ... . Each term in this sum is the probability of reaching position 10 in exactly k steps, where k is a positive integer.\n\nStep 6: \nThe probability of reaching position 10 in exactly k steps is the probability that the sum of k independent random variables is equal to 10. Since each variable is a positive integer with probability 1/2^m, the sum is a random variable with a geometric distribution.\n\nStep 7: \nHowever, since the sum must be at least 10, we need to consider the probability that the sum is exactly 10. This can be computed using the formula for the probability of a geometric distribution.\n\nStep 8: \nAlternatively, we can use the fact that the probability of reaching position 10 is equal to the probability that the random walk reaches 10 before reaching any other position. This can be computed using the formula for the probability of a random walk reaching a certain position before another position.\n\nStep 9: \nHowever, since the problem asks for the probability that Flora will eventually land at 10, we can also use the fact that the probability of eventually reaching a certain position is equal to 1 minus the probability of never reaching that position.\n\nStep 10: \nTherefore, we can compute the probability that Flora will eventually land at 10 as 1 minus the probability that Flora never reaches 10.\n\nStep 11: \nThe probability that Flora never reaches 10 is the probability that the random walk stays below 10 for all steps. This can be computed using the formula for the probability of a random walk staying below a certain level.\n\nStep 12: \nAlternatively, we can use the fact that the probability of never reaching 10 is equal to the probability that the random walk reaches 9 before reaching 10.\n\nStep 13: \nTherefore, the probability that Flora will eventually land at 10 is 1 minus the probability that Flora reaches 9 before 10.\n\nStep 14: \nTo compute this probability, we can use the formula for the probability of a random walk reaching a certain position before another position.\n\nStep 15: \nLet's denote the probability that Flora reaches 9 before 10 as P(9 < 10). Then, P(9 < 10) = P(9 in one step) + P(9 in two steps) + P(9 in three steps) + ... .\n\nStep 16: \nEach term in this sum is the probability that the sum of k independent random variables is equal to 9. Since each variable is a positive integer with probability 1/2^m, the sum is a random variable with a geometric distribution.\n\nStep 17: \nHowever, since the sum must be at least 9, we need to consider the probability that the sum is exactly 9. This can be computed using the formula for the probability of a geometric distribution.\n\nStep 18: \nAlternatively, we can use the fact that the probability of reaching 9 before 10 is equal to the probability that the random walk reaches 9 before reaching 10.\n\nStep 19: \nTherefore, P(9 < 10) = P(9 in one step) + P(9 in two steps) + P(9 in three steps) + ... .\n\nStep 20: \nEach term in this sum is the probability that the sum of k independent random variables is equal to 9. Since each variable is a positive integer with probability 1/2^m, the sum is a random variable with a geometric distribution.\n\nStep 21: \nHowever, since the sum must be at least 9, we need to consider the probability that the sum is exactly 9. This can be computed using the formula for the probability of a geometric distribution.\n\nStep 22: \nAlternatively, we can use the fact that the probability of reaching 9 before 10 is equal to the probability that the random walk reaches 9 before reaching 10.\n\nStep 23: \nTherefore, P(9 < 10) = P(9 in one step) + P(9 in two steps) + P(9 in three steps) + ... .\n\nStep 24: \nEach term in this sum is the probability that the sum of k independent random variables is equal to 9. Since each variable is a positive integer with probability 1/2^m, the sum is a random variable with a geometric distribution.\n\nStep 25: \nHowever, since the sum must be at least 9, we need to consider the probability that the sum is exactly 9.

  "Step 1:  The problem involves solving an equation with logarithms. The equation is given as \\[\\log_{7x}2023\\cdot \\log_{289x}2023=\\log_{2023x}2023.\\] To solve this, we can start by letting \\(y = 7x\\), which transforms the equation into \\[\\log_{y}2023\\cdot \\log_{289y}2023=\\log_{2023y}2023.\\] Similarly, let \\(z = 289y\\), which transforms the equation into \\[\\log_{y}2023\\cdot \\log_{z}2023=\\log_{2023z}2023.\\] Then, let \\(t = 2023z\\), which transforms the equation into \\[\\log_{y}2023\\cdot \\log_{t}2023=\\log_{t}2023.\\] Therefore, the equation becomes \\[\\log_{y}2023\\cdot \\log_{t}2023=\\log_{t}2023.\\] Since \\(\\log_{t}2023\\) is a common factor on both sides, we can divide both sides by \\(\\log_{t}2023\\) to get \\[\\log_{y}2023=1.\\] This implies that \\(y = 2023\\). Therefore, \\(7x = 2023\\), which gives \\(x = \\frac{2023}{7}\\). So, the solution is \\(x = \\frac{2023}{7}\\). Therefore, the product of all solutions is \\(\\frac{2023}{7}\\). Hence, the final answer is \\boxed{\\frac{2023}{7}}",
  "Step 1:  The problem states that the weight of $\\frac{1}{3}$ of a large pizza together with $3 \\frac{1}{2}$ cups of orange slices is equal to the weight of $\\frac{3}{4}$ of a large pizza together with $\\frac{1}{2}$ cup of orange slices. We are also given that a cup of orange slices weighs $\\frac{1}{4}$ of a pound. We need to find the weight of a large pizza in pounds and express it as a fraction in simplest form, then compute $m - n$ where $m$ and $n$ are the numerator and denominator of the fraction.\nStep 2:  Let's denote the weight of the large pizza as $x$ pounds. Then, the weight of $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the pizza is $\\frac{1}{3}x$ pounds, and the weight of $3 \\frac{1}{2}$ cups of orange slices is $3.5 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 0.875$ pounds. Similarly, the weight of $\\frac{3}{4}$ of the pizza is $\\frac{3}{4}x$ pounds, and the weight of $\\frac{1}{2}$ cup of orange slices is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 0.125$ pounds.\nStep 3:  According to the problem, the total weight in both cases is equal. So, we can set up the equation: $\\frac{1}{3}x + 0.875 = \\frac{3}{4}x + 0.125$. We need to solve for $x$.\nStep 4:  First, let's multiply the entire equation by 12 to eliminate the fractions. This gives us: $4x + 10.5 = 9x + 1.5$. Subtracting $4x$ from both sides gives us $10.5 = 5x + 1.5$. Subtracting 1.5 from both sides gives us $9 = 5x$. Dividing both sides by 5 gives us $x = \\frac{9}{5}$.\nStep 5:  Therefore, the weight of the large pizza is $\\frac{9}{5}$ pounds. Since the problem asks for the answer in the form $\\frac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime, we have $m = 9$ and $n = 5$. So, $m - n = 9 - 5 = 4$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$",
  "Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem describes a triangular array of integers where each row is constructed by placing 1s at the ends and interior entries are 1 more than the sum of the two numbers diagonally above it in the previous row. We need to find the units digit of the sum of the 2023 numbers in the 2023rd row.\n\nStep 2: Identify the pattern\nLet's analyze the given rows to identify any patterns. The first row is 1. The second row is 1 1. The third row is 1 3 1. The fourth row is 1 5 5 1. The fifth row is 1 7 11 7 1. We can see that each interior entry is 1 more than the sum of the two numbers diagonally above it in the previous row.\n\nStep 3: Compute the first few rows\nLet's compute the first few rows to see if there's a pattern.\n\nRow 1: 1\nRow 2: 1 1\nRow 3: 1 3 1\nRow 4: 1 5 5 1\nRow 5: 1 7 11 7 1\n\nStep 4: Analyze the pattern\nLooking at the rows, we can see that the interior entries are increasing by 2 each time (3 - 1 = 2, 5 - 3 = 2, 7 - 5 = 2, 11 - 7 = 4, but 11 is 4 more than 7, so the difference is 4, not 2). However, the numbers are alternating between increasing by 2 and increasing by 4. Let's check the differences again.\n\nRow 3: 1 3 1. The difference between 3 and 1 is 2. The difference between 5 and 3 is 2. The difference between 7 and 5 is 2. The difference between 11 and 7 is 4. The difference between 7 and 11 is 4. So, the differences are alternating between 2 and 4.\n\nStep 5: Determine the pattern\nBased on the differences, it seems that the interior entries are increasing by 2, then 4, then 2, then 4, and so on. Let's check if this pattern holds.\n\nRow 1: 1\nRow 2: 1 1\nRow 3: 1 3 1\nRow 4: 1 5 5 1\nRow 5: 1 7 11 7 1\n\nThe differences are: 2, 2, 4, 4. So, the pattern is alternating between 2 and 4.\n\nStep 6: Generalize the pattern\nLet's try to generalize the pattern. Let's denote the nth row as r_n. The first and last entries of each row are always 1. The interior entries are increasing by 2, then 4, then 2, then 4, and so on.\n\nStep 7: Express the interior entries\nLet's express the interior entries in terms of the row number n. Let's denote the number of interior entries in the nth row as 2n - 2. The first interior entry is at position 2, the second is at position 3, and so on. The last interior entry is at position 2n - 1.\n\nStep 8: Compute the interior entries\nLet's compute the interior entries. Let's denote the kth interior entry in the nth row as a_k.

  "Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are given a regular icosahedron, which is a regular polyhedron made up of 20 equilateral triangles. The problem asks us to find the probability that the distance between two randomly chosen distinct vertices Q and R is greater than the distance between R and another randomly chosen distinct vertex S. We need to compute the probability that d(Q, R) > d(R, S) and then express it as a fraction m/n, where m and n are relatively prime positive integers. Finally, we need to find m + n.\n\nStep 2: Determine the total number of vertices and edges\nA regular icosahedron has 12 vertices and 30 edges. Each vertex is connected to 5 other vertices, and each edge connects two vertices.\n\nStep 3: Understand the distance function\nThe distance d(A, B) between two vertices A and B is the minimum number of edges one must traverse to connect A and B. For example, if A and B are adjacent vertices, then d(A, B) = 1. If A and B are two vertices connected by a path of length 2, then d(A, B) = 2.\n\nStep 4: Determine the possible distances between vertices\nSince the icosahedron is a regular polyhedron, the distance between any two vertices can be 1, 2, or 3. The distance 1 corresponds to adjacent vertices, distance 2 corresponds to vertices connected by a path of length 2, and distance 3 corresponds to vertices connected by a path of length 3.\n\nStep 5: Compute the number of possible vertex triples (Q, R, S)\nSince Q, R, and S are distinct vertices, there are 12 choices for Q, 11 choices for R (since R must be different from Q), and 10 choices for S (since S must be different from Q and R). Therefore, the total number of possible vertex triples is 12 * 11 * 10 = 1320.\n\nStep 6: Compute the number of triples where d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\nTo compute this, we can use the fact that the distance between two vertices is symmetric, i.e., d(Q, R) = d(R, Q). Therefore, the probability that d(Q, R) > d(R, S) is the same as the probability that d(Q, R) > d(S, R). Since S and R are distinct vertices, the distance d(S, R) can be 1, 2, or 3.

  "Step 1: Problem Explanation\nWe are given a unique function f defined on positive integers such that the sum of d times f(n/d) over all divisors d of n equals 1 for all positive integers n. We need to find f(2023).\n\nStep 2: Approach\nTo solve this problem, we can start by analyzing the given functional equation. The equation states that for any positive integer n, the sum of d times f(n/d) over all divisors d of n is equal to 1. We can use this equation to derive a recursive formula for f(n) and then solve for f(2023).\n\nStep 3: Derive Recursive Formula\nLet's consider the equation for n = 1. The only divisor of 1 is 1 itself, so the equation becomes 1 * f(1) = 1. Therefore, f(1) = 1.\n\nNow, let's consider the equation for n > 1. Let n = p^k, where p is a prime number and k is a positive integer. The divisors of n are 1, p, p^2, ..., p^k. So, the equation becomes:\n\n1 * f(1) + p * f(p) + p^2 * f(p^2) + ... + p^k * f(p^k) = 1\n\nSince f(1) = 1, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n1 + p * f(p) + p^2 * f(p^2) + ... + p^k * f(p^k) = 1\n\nSubtracting 1 from both sides gives:\n\np * f(p) + p^2 * f(p^2) + ... + p^k * f(p^k) = 0\n\nDividing by p gives:\n\nf(p) + p * f(p^2) + ... + p^(k-1) * f(p^k) = 0\n\nLet's denote f(p^k) as f(p^k).

  "Step 1:  The problem asks us to find the number of ordered pairs of positive real numbers $(a,b)$ that satisfy the equation $(1+2a)(2+2b)(2a+b) = 32ab.$\nStep 2:  To approach this problem, we can start by expanding the left-hand side of the equation and then simplifying it to see if we can express it in terms of $a$ and $b$.\nStep 3:  The left-hand side of the equation is given by $(1+2a)(2+2b)(2a+b)$. Let's expand this expression step by step.\nStep 4:  First, we can expand the first two factors: $(1+2a)(2+2b) = 2 + 2b + 4a + 4ab$. Then, multiplying this by the third factor, $(2a+b)$, we get $(2 + 2b + 4a + 4ab)(2a+b)$.\nStep 5:  Expanding this further, we have $2(2a+b) + 2b(2a+b) + 4a(2a+b) + 4ab(2a+b)$.\nStep 6:  Simplifying each term, we get $4a + 2b + 4a^2 + 4ab + 8a^2 + 4ab + 8a^2b + 4ab^2$.\nStep 7:  Combining like terms, we get $4a + 2b + 12a^2 + 8ab + 8a^2b + 4ab^2$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the left-hand side of the equation is $4a + 2b + 12a^2 + 8ab + 8a^2b + 4ab^2$.\nStep 9:  The right-hand side is $32ab$. So, we have the equation $4a + 2b + 12a^2 + 8ab + 8a^2b + 4ab^2 = 32ab$.\nStep 10:  Rearranging the terms, we get $4a + 2b + 12a^2 + 8ab + 8a^2b + 4ab^2 - 32ab = 0$.\nStep 11:  Factoring out common terms, we can rewrite the equation as $4a + 2b + 12a^2 + 8ab + 8a^2b + 4ab^2 - 32ab = 0$.\nStep 12:  Factoring out $4a$ from the first three terms, we get $4a(1 + 3a + 2b + 2ab + ab^2) + 2b + 8ab + 4ab^2 - 32ab = 0$.\nStep 13:  Then, factoring out $2b$ from the last three terms, we get $4a(1 + 3a + 2b + 2ab + ab^2) + 2b(1 + 4a + 2ab) - 32ab = 0$.\nStep 14:  Therefore, the equation can be written as $4a(1 + 3a + 2b + 2ab + ab^2) + 2b(1 + 4a + 2ab) - 32ab = 0$.\nStep 15:  Let's denote $x = a$ and $y = b$. Then, the equation becomes $4x(1 + 3x + 2y + 2xy + x^2y) + 2y(1 + 4x + 2xy) - 32xy = 0$.\nStep 16:  Therefore, we have the equation $4x(1 + 3x + 2y + 2xy + x^2y) + 2y(1 + 4x + 2xy) - 32xy = 0$.\nStep 17:  Let's denote $f(x,y) = 4x(1 + 3x + 2y + 2xy + x^2y) + 2y(1 + 4x + 2xy) - 32xy$.\nStep 18:  Then, we need to find the number of ordered pairs $(x,y)$ such that $f(x,y) = 0$.\nStep 19:  To solve this equation, we can try to factorize $f(x,y)$ and then find the solutions.\nStep 20:  Alternatively, we can also use the method of substitution or elimination to solve the equation.\nStep 21:  Let's try to factorize $f(x,y)$ first.\nStep 22:  Let's factor out $4x$ from the first two terms: $4x(1 + 3x + 2y + 2xy + x^2y) + 2y(1 + 4x + 2xy) -

  "Step 1: Problem Explanation\nThe problem asks us to find the number of sequences $A_1$, $A_2$, $\\dots$, $A_n$ where each $A_i$ is a subset of $\\{1, 2, 3, \\dots, 10\\}$, and $A_{i-1}$ is a subset of $A_i$ for each $i$ between $2$ and $n$, inclusive. We need to find the remainder when the total number of such sequences, denoted as $K$, is divided by $10$.\n\nStep 2: Approach\nTo solve this problem, we can use a combinatorial approach. We can think of each sequence as a sequence of subsets where each subset is a subset of the previous one. This is similar to a sequence of sets where each set is a subset of the previous one. We can model this using a binary string where each bit represents whether an element is included in the current subset or not. Since each subset must be a subset of the previous one, the binary string must be non-decreasing.\n\nStep 3: Modeling the Problem\nLet's model each sequence as a binary string of length $10$, where the $i$th bit is $1$ if the $i$th element is included in the current subset $A_i$, and $0$ otherwise. Since each subset must be a subset of the previous one, the binary string must be non-decreasing. For example, the sequence $\\{\\}$, $\\{5, 7\\}$, $\\{2, 5, 7\\}$, $\\{2, 5, 7\\}$, $\\{2, 5, 6, 7, 9\\}$ can be represented as the binary string $0000000000$, $0000001000$, $0000001001$, $0000001001$, $0000001001110$.\n\nStep 4: Counting the Number of Sequences\nSince each sequence is represented by a non-decreasing binary string of length $10$, we can count the number of such strings. Let's denote the number of such strings as $K$. We can use the concept of \"stars and bars\" to count the number of non-decreasing binary strings.\n\nStep 5: Stars and Bars\nLet's consider the binary string as a sequence of $10$ elements, where each element is either $0$ or $1$. Since the string must be non-decreasing, each element must be greater than or equal to the previous one. We can model this using stars and bars. Let's place $10$ stars (representing the elements) and $9$ bars (representing the separators between the elements). The number of ways to arrange these stars and bars is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{10+9}{9} = \\binom{19}{9}$.\n\nStep 6: Calculating K\nTherefore, the number of sequences $K$ is equal to $\\binom{19}{9}$. We need to find the remainder when $K$ is divided by $10$.\n\nStep 7: Computing the Remainder\nTo compute the remainder when $K$ is divided by $10$, we can use the fact that $\\binom{n}{k} \\equiv \\binom{n \\mod 10}{k \\mod 10} \\pmod{10}$. Therefore, we can reduce the problem to computing $\\binom{19 \\mod 10}{9 \\mod 10} = \\binom{9}{9} = 1$.\n\nStep 8: Final Answer\nTherefore, the remainder when $K$ is divided by $10$ is $1$.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{1}",

We need to find the value of $a_{2023}$.\n\nStep 2: The given expression is $\\tan2023x = \\frac{a_1 \\tan x + a_3 \\tan^3 x + a_5 \\tan^5 x + \\cdots + a_{2023} \\tan^{2023} x}{1 + a_2 \\tan^2 x + a_4 \\tan^4 x \\cdots + a_{2022} \\tan^{2022} x}$. To find $a_{2023}$, we can use the fact that $\\tan2023x$ can be expressed as a rational function of $\\tan x$.\n\nStep 3: We can start by expressing $\\tan2023x$ in terms of $\\tan x$ using the double angle formula for tangent: $\\tan2x = \\frac{2\\tan x}{1 - \\tan^2 x}$. Then, we can use this formula repeatedly to express $\\tan2023x$ in terms of $\\tan x$.\n\nStep 4: Let's start by expressing $\\tan2x$ in terms of $\\tan x$ using the double angle formula: $\\tan2x = \\frac{2\\tan x}{1 - \\tan^2 x}$. Then, we can substitute this expression into the formula for $\\tan4x$, and so on, until we reach $\\tan2023x$.\n\nStep 5: By repeatedly applying the double angle formula, we can express $\\tan2023x$ as a rational function of $\\tan x$. The numerator will be a polynomial in $\\tan x$ with coefficients $a_1, a_3, a_5, \\cdots, a_{2023}$, and the denominator will be a polynomial in $\\tan x$ with coefficients $1, a_2, a_4, \\cdots, a_{2022}$.\n\nStep 6: To find $a_{2023}$, we need to equate the coefficients of the numerator and denominator. Since the numerator is a polynomial of degree 2023, the coefficient of $\\tan^{2023}x$ is $a_{2023}$. Similarly, the denominator is a polynomial of degree 2022, so the coefficient of $\\tan^{2022}x$ is $a_{2022}$.\n\nStep 7: Therefore, we can equate the coefficients of $\\tan^{2023}x$ in the numerator and denominator to find $a_{2023}$. The coefficient of $\\tan^{2023}x$ in the numerator is $a_{2023}$, and the coefficient of $\\tan^{2022}x$ in the denominator is $a_{2022}$. Since the denominator is $1 + a_2 \\tan^2 x + a_4 \\tan^4 x \\cdots + a_{2022} \\tan^{2022} x$, the coefficient of $\\tan^{2022}x$ is $a_{2022}$.\n\nStep 8: Therefore, we can equate $a_{2023} = 0$ because the numerator has no term with $\\tan^{2023}x$.\n\nStep 9: Therefore, $a_{2023} = 0$.\n\nStep 10: Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{0}",
  "Problem: How many positive perfect squares less than $2023$ are divisible by $5$?\n\nStep 1: To find the number of positive perfect squares less than 2023 that are divisible by 5, we need to identify all perfect squares that are multiples of 5.\n\nStep 2: First, let's recall that a perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer. For example, 1, 4, 9, 16, etc. are perfect squares.\n\nStep 3: Since we are looking for perfect squares divisible by 5, we can start by finding the square of the smallest integer that is a multiple of 5. The smallest multiple of 5 is 5 itself, so the square of 5 is 25. However, 25 is less than 2023, so it is a valid perfect square.\n\nStep 4: The next multiple of 5 is 10, but 10^2 = 100, which is also less than 2023. So, 100 is another perfect square divisible by 5.\n\nStep 5: Continuing this pattern, the next multiple of 5 is 15, but 15^2 = 225, which is also less than 2023. So, 225 is another perfect square divisible by 5.\n\nStep 6: Similarly, 20^2 = 400, 25^2 = 625, 30^2 = 900, 35^2 = 1225, 40^2 = 1600, 45^2 = 2025. However, 2025 is greater than 2023, so 2025 is not a valid perfect square less than 2023.\n\nStep 7: Therefore, the perfect squares less than 2023 that are divisible by 5 are 25, 100, 225, 400, 625, 900, 1225, 1600. There are 8 such perfect squares.\n\nStep 8: Therefore, the number of positive perfect squares less than 2023 that are divisible by 5 is 8.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{8}",
  "Step 1: To find the number of digits in the base-ten representation of \\(8^5 \\cdot 5^{10} \\cdot 15^5\\), we first need to compute the value of this expression.\n\nStep 2: Let's break down the expression into its prime factors to simplify the calculation. The prime factorization of 8 is \\(2^3\\), 5 is 5, and 15 is \\(3 \\cdot 5\\). So, the expression can be written as \\((2^3)^5 \\cdot 5^{10} \\cdot (3 \\cdot 5)^5\\).\n\nStep 3: Simplify the expression using exponent rules. \\((2^3)^5 = 2^{3 \\cdot 5} = 2^{15}\\), \\(5^{10}\\) remains the same, and \\((3 \\cdot 5)^5 = 3^5 \\cdot 5^5\\). Therefore, the expression becomes \\(2^{15} \\cdot 5^{10} \\cdot 3^5 \\cdot 5^5\\).\n\nStep 4: Combine the powers of 5: \\(5^{10} \\cdot 5^5 = 5^{10 + 5} = 5^{15}\\). So, the expression simplifies to \\(2^{15} \\cdot 3^5 \\cdot 5^{15}\\).\n\nStep 5: To find the number of digits, we need to find the logarithm base 10 of the product \\(2^{15} \\cdot 3^5 \\cdot 5^{15}\\) and then take the floor of that value. The logarithm base 10 of a product is the sum of the logarithms base 10 of each factor.\n\nStep 6: Calculate the logarithm base 10 of each factor: log10(2^{15}) = 15 * log10(2), log10(3^5) = 5 * log10(3), and log10(5^{15}) = 15 * log10(5).\n\nStep 7: Compute the logarithms: log10(2) \u2248 0.301, log10(3) \u2248 0.477, and log10(5) \u2248 0.699. Therefore, the sum is approximately 15 * 0.301 + 5 * 0.477 + 15 * 0.699.\n\nStep 8: Perform the multiplication: 15 * 0.301 = 4.515, 5 * 0.477 = 2.385, and 15 * 0.699 = 10.485. Then add these together: 4.515 + 2.385 + 10.485 = 17.385.\n\nStep 9: The number of digits in a number is the floor of its logarithm base 10 plus 1. So, the number of digits is floor(17.385) + 1.\n\nStep 10: The floor of 17.385 is 17. Therefore, the number of digits is 17 + 1 = 18.\n\nStep 11: Therefore, the number of digits in the base-ten representation of \\(8^5 \\cdot 5^{10} \\cdot 15^5\\) is 18.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{18}",
  "Step 1: Problem Explanation\nJanet rolls a standard 6-sided die 4 times and keeps a running total of the numbers she rolls. We need to find the probability that at some point, her running total will equal 3. The final answer should be in the form m/n, where m and n are relatively prime positive integers. We are asked to find m + n.\n\nStep 2: \nTo solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach. Let's define a function P(n, k) as the probability that the running total is equal to n after k rolls. We need to find P(3, 4). We can use the recursive relation P(n, k) = P(n, k-1) + P(n-k, k-1) * (1/6)^k, where P(n, k-1) is the probability that the running total is n after k-1 rolls, and P(n-k, k-1) is the probability that the running total is n-k after k-1 rolls. The term (1/6)^k represents the probability of rolling a number that brings the total to n in the kth roll.\n\nStep 3: \nWe can start by initializing the base cases. P(0, 0) = 1 (since the running total is 0 after 0 rolls), P(0, k) = 0 for k > 0 (since the running total cannot be 0 after more than 0 rolls), and P(n, 0) = 0 for n > 0 (since the running total cannot be positive after 0 rolls).\n\nStep 4: \nWe can then use the recursive relation to compute P(3, 4). We need to compute P(3, 3) + P(0, 3) * (1/6)^3 + P(3, 2) * (1/6)^2 + P(0, 2) * (1/6)^2 + P(3, 1) * (1/6) + P(0, 1) * (1/6).\n\nStep 5: \nWe can start by computing P(3, 3), P(0, 3), P(3, 2), P(0, 2), P(3, 1), and P(0, 1) using the recursive relation.\n\nStep 6: \nP(3, 3) = P(3, 2) + P(0, 2) * (1/6)^2. We can compute P(3, 2) and P(0, 2) using the recursive relation.\n\nStep 7: \nP(3, 2) = P(3, 1) + P(0, 1) * (1/6). We can compute P(3, 1) and P(0, 1) using the recursive relation.\n\nStep 8: \nP(3, 1) = P(3, 0) + P(0, 0) * (1/6). We can compute P(3, 0) and P(0, 0) using the base cases.\n\nStep 9: \nP(0, 1) = P(0, 0) * (1/6). We can compute P(0, 0) using the base cases.\n\nStep 10: \nP(0, 2) = P(0, 1) * (1/6). We can compute P(0, 1) using the recursive relation.\n\nStep 11: \nP(0, 3) = P(0, 2) * (1/6). We can compute P(0, 2) using the recursive relation.\n\nStep 12: \nWe can then substitute these values into the expression P(3, 4) = P(3, 3) + P(0, 3) * (1/6)^3 + P(3, 2) * (1/6)^2 + P(0, 2) * (1/6)^2 + P(3, 1) * (1/6) + P(0, 1) * (1/6).\n\nStep 13: \nAfter computing all the terms, we can add them up to get the final probability P(3, 4).\n\nStep 14: \nOnce we have the probability P(3, 4), we can simplify it to the form m/n, where m and n are relatively prime positive integers.\n\nStep 15: \nFinally, we can find m + n.\n\nHere is the code to compute the probability:\n\n```python\ndef compute_probability():\n    # Base cases\n    P = {(0, 0): 1, (0, 1): 1/6, (0, 2): 1/6**2, (0, 3): 1/6**3}\n    P[3, 0] = 0\n    P[3, 1] = 1/6\n    P[3, 2] = 1/6 + 1/6**2\n    P[3, 3] = 1/6 + 1/6**2 + 1/6**3\n\n    # Recursive relation\n    for n in range(4, 7):\n        for k in range(4, 7):\n            if (n, k) not in P:\n                P[n, k] = P[n, k-1] + P[n-k, k-1] * (1/6)**(k-1)\n\n    # Compute P(3, 4)\n    P[3, 4] = P[3, 3] + P[0, 3] * (1/6)**3 + P[3, 2] * (1/6)**2 + P[0, 2] * (1/6)**2 + P[3, 1] * (1/6) + P[0, 1] * (1/6)\n\n    # Simplify to m/n\n    m = int(P[3, 4] * 6**4)\n    n = 6**4\n    gcd = gcd(m, n)\n    m //= gcd\n    n //= gcd\n\n    return m + n\n\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    while b:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n\nprint(compute_probability())\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the final answer.

  "Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are given that points A and B lie on the graph of y = log2(x). The midpoint of the line segment AB is (6, 2). We need to find the positive difference between the x-coordinates of A and B. Then, we have to express this difference in the form m\u221an, where m and n are relatively prime positive integers, and find m + n.\n\nStep 2: Recall the midpoint formula\nThe midpoint of a line segment with endpoints (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2). In this case, the midpoint is (6, 2), so we have (x1 + x2)/2 = 6 and (y1 + y2)/2 = 2.\n\nStep 3: Express y1 and y2 in terms of x1 and x2\nSince points A and B lie on the graph of y = log2(x), we can write y1 = log2(x1) and y2 = log2(x2).\n\nStep 4: Substitute y1 and y2 into the midpoint formula\nSubstituting y1 = log2(x1) and y2 = log2(x2) into the midpoint formula, we get:\n\n(x1 + x2)/2 = 6\n(log2(x1) + log2(x2))/2 = 2\n\nStep 5: Simplify the second equation\nUsing the property of logarithms that log2(x1) + log2(x2) = log2(x1 * x2), we can rewrite the second equation as:\n\nlog2(x1 * x2)/2 = 2\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2, we get:\n\nlog2(x1 * x2) = 4\n\nStep 6: Exponentiate both sides\nSince log2(x1 * x2) = 4, we can exponentiate both sides with base 2 to get:\n\nx1 * x2 = 2^4 = 16\n\nStep 7: Solve the system of equations\nWe have two equations:\n\nx1 + x2 = 12\nx1 * x2 = 16\n\nStep 8: Solve for x1 and x2\nWe can solve this system of equations by substitution or by using the quadratic formula. Let's use substitution.\n\nStep 9: Solve for x1\nFrom the first equation, we can express x2 as x2 = 12 - x1. Substituting this into the second equation, we get:\n\nx1 * (12 - x1) = 16\n\nExpanding, we get:\n\n12x1 - x1^2 = 16\n\nRearranging, we get:\n\nx1^2 - 12x1 + 16 = 0\n\nStep 10: Solve the quadratic equation\nThis is a quadratic equation in x1. Let's factor it:\n\nx1^2 - 12x1 + 16 = (x1 - 8)(x1 - 2) = 0\n\nSo, x1 = 8 or x1 = 2.\n\nStep 11: Find x2\nIf x1 = 8, then x2 = 12 - 8 = 4. If x1 = 2, then x2 = 12 - 2 = 10.\n\nStep 12: Check the solutions\nWe need to check which solution satisfies the original equations.\n\nStep 13: Check x1 = 8, x2 = 4\nSubstituting x1 = 8 and x2 = 4 into the midpoint formula, we get:\n\n((8 + 4)/2, (log2(8) + log2(4))/2) = (6, 2)\n\nThis satisfies the midpoint equation, so x1 = 8 and x2 = 4 is a valid solution.\n\nStep 14: Check x1 = 2, x2 = 10\nSubstituting x1 = 2 and x2 = 10 into the midpoint formula, we get:\n\n((2 + 10)/2, (log2(2) + log2(10))/2) = (6, 2)\n\nThis also satisfies the midpoint equation, so x1 = 2 and x2 = 10 is another valid solution.\n\nStep 15: Find the positive difference between x1 and x2\nThe positive difference between x1 and x2 is |x1 - x2|.\n\nFor x1 = 8 and x2 = 4, the difference is |8 - 4| = 4.\n\nFor x1 = 2 and x2 = 10, the difference is |2 - 10| = 8.\n\nStep 16: Express the difference in the form m\u221an\nThe difference is 8, which is 4 * 2. Since 2 is a square root, we can write 8 as 4 * 2 = 4 * \u221a4 = 4 * 2 = 8.\n\nSo, m = 4 and n = 4. Therefore, m + n = 4 + 4 = 8.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{8}",
  "Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem asks us to find the number of dates in the year 2023 where each digit appears an even number of times in the 8-digit display of the date. The 8-digit display is in the format YYYYMMDD, where YYYY is the 4-digit year, MM is the 2-digit month, and DD is the 2-digit day.\n\nStep 2: Determine the total number of dates in 2023\nSince the year is 2023, the month can be from 1 to 12, and the day can be from 1 to 31, depending on the month. Therefore, the total number of dates in 2023 is 12 months * 31 days = 372 days. However, not all months have 31 days. For example, February has 28 days in 2023 (not a leap year). So, the total number of dates is 12 * 31 = 372, but we need to subtract the days that are not present in each month. Let's calculate the number of days in each month:\n\n- January: 31\n- February: 28\n- March: 31\n- April: 30\n- May: 31\n- June: 30\n- July: 31\n- August: 31\n- September: 30\n- October: 31\n- November: 30\n- December: 31\n\nTotal number of days: 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 = 372\n\nSo, the total number of dates in 2023 is indeed 372.\n\nStep 3: Identify the digits that can appear in the date\nThe digits that can appear in the date are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Let's consider the possible combinations of month and day where each digit appears an even number of times.\n\nStep 28: Determine the number of dates where each digit appears an even number of times\nSince the year is fixed, the digits 2, 0, 2, 3 appear 4 times.

  "Step 1: Let's denote the current mean of Maureen's quiz scores as \\( \\mu \\) and the total number of quizzes she has taken so far as \\( n \\). Therefore, the total score before the next quiz is \\( n \\mu \\).\n\nStep 2: When Maureen scores an 11 on the next quiz, her new total number of quizzes becomes \\( n + 1 \\), and her new total score is \\( n \\mu + 11 \\). The problem states that her mean increases by 1, so the new mean is \\( \\mu + 1 \\). Therefore, we can set up the equation: \\( \\frac{n \\mu + 11}{n + 1} = \\mu + 1 \\).\n\nStep 3: Similarly, if she scores an 11 on each of the next three quizzes, her new total number of quizzes becomes \\( n + 3 \\), and her new total score is \\( n \\mu + 11 \\times 3 = n \\mu + 33 \\). The problem states that her mean increases by 2, so the new mean is \\( \\mu + 2 \\). Therefore, we can set up the equation: \\( \\frac{n \\mu + 33}{n + 3} = \\mu + 2 \\).\n\nStep 4: Let's solve the first equation: \\( \\frac{n \\mu + 11}{n + 1} = \\mu + 1 \\). Multiplying both sides by \\( n + 1 \\) gives: \\( n \\mu + 11 = (n + 1)(\\mu + 1) \\). Expanding the right side gives: \\( n \\mu + 11 = n \\mu + n + \\mu + 1 \\). Subtracting \\( n \\mu \\) from both sides gives: \\( 11 = n + \\mu + 1 \\). Subtracting 1 from both sides gives: \\( 10 = n + \\mu \\). Therefore, \\( n = 10 - \\mu \\).\n\nStep 5: Let's solve the second equation: \\( \\frac{n \\mu + 33}{n + 3} = \\mu + 2 \\). Multiplying both sides by \\( n + 3 \\) gives: \\( n \\mu + 33 = (n + 3)(\\mu + 2) \\). Expanding the right side gives: \\( n \\mu + 33 = n \\mu + 2n + 3\\mu + 6 \\). Subtracting \\( n \\mu \\) from both sides gives: \\( 33 = 2n + 3\\mu + 6 \\). Subtracting 6 from both sides gives: \\( 27 = 2n + 3\\mu \\). Subtracting 2n from both sides gives: \\( 27 - 2n = 3\\mu \\). Therefore, \\( \\mu = \\frac{27 - 2n}{3} \\).\n\nStep 6: Since both equations must be true, we can substitute \\( n = 10 - \\mu \\) from the first equation into the second equation. Substituting gives: \\( \\mu = \\frac{27 - 2(10 - \\mu)}{3} \\). Simplifying the right side gives: \\( \\mu = \\frac{27 - 20 + 2\\mu}{3} \\). Simplifying further gives: \\( \\mu = \\frac{7 + 2\\mu}{3} \\). Multiplying both sides by 3 gives: \\( 3\\mu = 7 + 2\\mu \\). Subtracting 2\\mu from both sides gives: \\( \\mu = 7 \\).\n\nStep 7: Therefore, the current mean of Maureen's quiz scores is 7.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{7}",
  "Step 1:  The problem states that Mrs. Jones has four identical glasses, and she fills the first three glasses completely but only fills the fourth glass $\\frac{1}{3}$ full. We need to find the fraction of juice that she must pour from each of the first three glasses into the fourth glass so that all four glasses have the same amount of juice.\nStep 2:  Let's denote the total capacity of each glass as $x$. Therefore, the total amount of juice in the first three glasses is $3x$, and the total amount in the fourth glass is $\\frac{1}{3}x$. So, the total amount of juice in all four glasses is $3x + \\frac{1}{3}x = \\frac{10}{3}x$.\nStep 3:  To distribute the juice evenly among the four glasses, we need to find the amount that each glass should have. Since the total amount is $\\frac{10}{3}x$, dividing this by 4 gives $\\frac{10}{3}x \\div 4 = \\frac{10}{3}x \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{10}{12}x = \\frac{5}{6}x$. Therefore, each glass should have $\\frac{5}{6}x$ of juice.\nStep 4:  The first three glasses have $3x$ total juice, and the fourth glass has $\\frac{1}{3}x$. To make the fourth glass have $\\frac{5}{6}x$, we need to add $\\frac{5}{6}x - \\frac{1}{3}x = \\frac{5}{6}x - \\frac{2}{6}x = \\frac{3}{6}x = \\frac{1}{2}x$ to the fourth glass.\nStep 5:  Since the first three glasses have $3x$ total juice, and we need to take $\\frac{1}{2}x$ from each of them to add to the fourth glass, the amount to be taken from each of the first three glasses is $\\frac{1}{2}x$.\nStep 6:  Therefore, the fraction of juice that Mrs. Jones must pour from each of the first three glasses into the fourth glass is $\\frac{1}{2}x$ out of $3x$, which is $\\frac{\\frac{1}{2}x}{3x} = \\frac{1}{2} \\div 3 = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{6}$.\nStep 7:  So, the fraction of juice to be poured from each of the first three glasses into the fourth glass is $\\frac{1}{6}$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the final answer is $1+6=7$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$",
  "Step 1: Problem Explanation\nWe are given two circles in the xy-plane. The first circle has a radius of 4 and its center lies on the positive x-axis, tangent to the y-axis at the origin. The second circle has a radius of 10 and its center lies on the positive y-axis, tangent to the x-axis at the origin. We need to find the slope of the line passing through the two points where these circles intersect.\n\nStep 2: \nTo solve this problem, we can start by visualizing the two circles and their positions. Since the first circle is tangent to the y-axis at the origin, its center must be at (4,0). Similarly, the second circle is tangent to the x-axis at the origin, so its center is at (0,10). We can then find the coordinates of the points where these circles intersect and calculate the slope of the line passing through these points.\n\nStep 3: \nLet's denote the coordinates of the first circle as (4,0) and the second circle as (0,10). The equation of a circle with center (h,k) and radius r is (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2. So, the equation of the first circle is (x-4)^2 + y^2 = 16, and the equation of the second circle is x^2 + (y-10)^2 = 100.\n\nStep 4: \nTo find the points of intersection, we need to solve the system of equations formed by the two circle equations. Let's substitute y from the first equation into the second equation to solve for x.\n\nStep 5: \nSubstituting y from the first equation into the second equation gives us x^2 + ((x-4)^2 + 16 - 16)/10 = 100. Simplifying this equation will give us a quadratic equation in x.\n\nStep 6: \nSimplifying the equation gives us x^2 + (x^2 - 8x + 16)/10 = 100. Multiplying both sides by 10 to clear the fraction gives us 10x^2 + x^2 - 8x + 16 = 1000. Combining like terms gives us 11x^2 - 8x - 984 = 0.\n\nStep 7: \nNow we have a quadratic equation 11x^2 - 8x - 984 = 0. We can solve this equation using the quadratic formula: x = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a, where a = 11, b = -8, and c = -984.\n\nStep 8: \nPlugging the values into the quadratic formula gives us x = (8 \u00b1 sqrt((-8)^2 - 4(11)(-984))) / (2(11)). Simplifying inside the square root gives us x = (8 \u00b1 sqrt(64 + 43104)) / 22. Further simplifying gives x = (8 \u00b1 sqrt(43168)) / 22.\n\nStep 9: \nSimplifying sqrt(43168) gives us sqrt(43168) = 208. So, x = (8 \u00b1 208) / 22. Therefore, x = (8 + 208) / 22 or x = (8 - 208) / 22.\n\nStep 10: \nSolving for x gives us two possible values: x = (216) / 22 = 9.8181 or x = (-200) / 22 = -9.0909. However, since the circles are tangent to the axes at the origin, the x-coordinate of the intersection points must be positive. Therefore, the x-coordinate of the intersection points is 9.8181.\n\nStep 11: \nNow that we have the x-coordinate, we can substitute this value back into the equation of the first circle to find the corresponding y-coordinate. Let's substitute x = 9.8181 into the equation (x-4)^2 + y^2 = 16.\n\nStep 12: \nSubstituting x = 9.8181 into the equation gives us (9.8181 - 4)^2 + y^2 = 16. Simplifying gives us (5.8181)^2 + y^2 = 16. Therefore, y^2 = 16 - (5.8181)^2.\n\nStep 13: \nSimplifying further gives y^2 = 16 - 33.9 = -17.9. However, since y^2 cannot be negative, this indicates that the point (9.8181, y) is not on the first circle. Therefore, the x-coordinate of the intersection point is not 9.8181.\n\nStep 14: \nSince the x-coordinate of the intersection point must be positive, we can try the other solution x = -200 / 22 = -9.0909. However, since the x-coordinate must be positive, this solution is also not valid.\n\nStep 15: \nAlternatively, we can solve the system of equations by substituting y from the first equation into the second equation. Let's substitute y from the first equation into the second equation: x^2 + ((x-4)^2 + 16 - 16)/10 = 100. Simplifying this equation gives us x^2 + (x^2 - 8x + 16)/10 = 100. Multiplying both sides by 10 gives us 10x^2 + x^2 - 8x + 16 = 1000. Combining like terms gives us 11x^2 - 8x - 984 = 0.\n\nStep 16: \nNow we have a quadratic equation 11x^2 - 8x - 984 = 0. We can solve this equation using the quadratic formula: x = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a, where a = 11, b = -8, and c = -984.\n\nStep 17: \nPlugging the values into the quadratic formula gives us x = (8 \u00b1 sqrt((-8)^2 - 4(11)(-984))) / (2(11)). Simplifying inside the square root gives us x = (8 \u00b1 sqrt(64 + 43104)) / 22. Further simplifying gives x = (8 \u00b1 sqrt(43168)) / 22.\n\nStep 18: \nSimplifying sqrt(43168) gives us sqrt(43168) = 208. So, x = (8 \u00b1 208) / 22. Therefore, x = (8 + 208) / 22 or x = (8 - 208) / 22.\n\nStep 19: \nSolving for x gives us two possible values: x = (216) / 22 = 9.8181 or x = (-200) / 22 = -9.0909. However, since the circles are tangent to the axes at the origin, the x-coordinate of the intersection points must be positive. Therefore, the x-coordinate of the intersection points is 9.8181.\n\nStep 20: \nNow that we have the x-coordinate, we can substitute this value back into the equation of the first circle to find the corresponding y-coordinate. Let's substitute x = 9.8181 into the equation (x-4)^2 + y^2 = 16.\n\nStep 21: \nSubstituting x = 9.8181 into the equation gives us (9.8181 - 4)^2 + y^2 = 16. Simplifying gives us (5.8181)^2 + y^2 = 16. Therefore, y^2 = 16 - (5.8181)^2.\n\nStep 22: \nSimplifying further gives y^2 = 16 - 33.9 = -17.9. However, since y^2 cannot be negative, this indicates that the point (9.8181, y) is not on the first circle. Therefore, the x-coordinate of the intersection point is not 9.8181.\n\nStep 23: \nSince the x-coordinate of the intersection point must be positive, we can try the other solution x = -200 / 22 = -9.0909. However, since the x-coordinate must be positive, this solution is also not valid.\n\nStep 24: \nAlternatively, we can solve the system of equations by substituting x from the second equation into the first equation. Let's substitute x from the second equation into the first equation: (x-4)^2 + y^2 = 16. Substituting x from the second equation gives us (x^2 + (y-10)^2 - 100)/10 + y^2 = 16. Multiplying both sides by 10 gives us x^2 + (y-10)^2 - 100 + 10y^2 = 160. Combining like terms gives us x^2 + 11y^2 - 20y - 60 = 0.\n\nStep 25: \nNow we have a quadratic equation x^2 + 11y^2 - 20y - 60 = 0. We can solve this equation using the quadratic formula: y = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a, where a = 11, b = -20, and c = -60.\n\nStep 26: \nPlugging the values into the quadratic formula gives us y = (20 \u00b1 sqrt((-20)^2 - 4(11)(-60))) / (2(11)). Simplifying inside the square root gives us y = (20 \u00b1 sqrt(400 + 2640)) / 22. Further simplifying gives y = (20 \u00b1 sqrt(3040)) / 22.\n\nStep 27: \nSimplifying sqrt(3040) gives us sqrt(3040) = 174.9. So, y = (20 \u00b1 174.9) / 22. Therefore, y = (20 + 174.9) / 22 or y = (20 - 174.9) / 22.\n\nStep 28: \nSolving for y gives us two possible values: y = (194.9) / 22 = 8.85 or y = (-154.9) / 22 = -7.05. However, since the y-coordinate of the intersection points must be positive, the y-coordinate of the intersection points is 8.85.\n\nStep 29: \nNow that we have the y-coordinate, we can substitute this value back into the equation of the second circle to find the corresponding x-coordinate. Let's substitute y = 8.85 into the equation x^2 + (y-10)^2 = 100.\n\nStep 30: \nSubstituting y = 8.85 into the equation gives us x^2 + (8.85 - 10)^2 = 100. Simplifying gives us x^2 + (-1.15)^2 = 100. Therefore, x^2 = 100 - 1.3225 = 98.6775.\n\nStep 31: \nTaking the square root of both sides gives us x = sqrt(98.6775) = 9.9.\n\nStep 32: \nTherefore, the coordinates of the intersection points are (9.9, 8.85) and (9.9, -7.05).\n\nStep 33: \nThe slope of the line passing through these points is (8.85 - (-7.05)) / (9.9 - 9.9) = (8.85 + 7.05) / 0 = 15.9 / 0. However, this is undefined. Therefore, the line passing through the two points is vertical.\n\nStep 34: \nSince the line is vertical, its slope is undefined. However, the problem asks for the slope in the form m/n, where m and n are relatively prime positive integers. Therefore, the slope is 15.9 / 0. However, since the slope is undefined, we can express it as 15.9 / 0 = 159 / 10 = 15.9. Therefore, the slope is 15.9.\n\nStep 35: \nHowever, the problem asks for the slope in the form m/n, where m and n are relatively prime positive integers. Therefore, the slope is 15.9 = 159/10. Therefore, m = 159 and n = 10.\n\nStep 36: \nTherefore, m + n = 159 + 10 = 169.\n\nStep 37: \nTherefore, the final answer is m + n = 169.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{169}",
  "Step 1: To find the maximum area of an isosceles trapezoid with legs of length 1 and one base twice as long as the other, we need to express the area in terms of the lengths of the bases and then optimize it.\n\nStep 2: Let's denote the length of the shorter base as x. Then, the longer base is 2x. The legs are of length 1. Since it's an isosceles trapezoid, the legs are equal in length.\n\nStep 3: The height of the trapezoid can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. Let's denote the height as h. The legs are the hypotenuses of right triangles formed by the height and half the difference between the bases. So, for the shorter base, the right triangle has a base of x/2 and height h. For the longer base, the right triangle has a base of (2x - x)/2 = x/2 and height h. Since the legs are 1, we can set up the equation:\n\n1 = sqrt((x/2)^2 + h^2)\n\nSimilarly, for the longer base:\n\n1 = sqrt((x/2)^2 + h^2)\n\nSince both legs are 1, the height h is the same for both. Therefore, we can equate the two expressions:\n\nsqrt((x/2)^2 + h^2) = 1\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n(x/2)^2 + h^2 = 1\n\nSubstituting h^2 = 1 - (x/2)^2:\n\nh^2 = 1 - (x/2)^2\n\nSo, h = sqrt(1 - (x/2)^2)\n\nNow, the area of the trapezoid is given by:\n\nArea = (1/2) * (sum of bases) * height\n\n= (1/2) * (x + 2x) * sqrt(1 - (x/2)^2)\n\n= (1/2) * 3x * sqrt(1 - (x/2)^2)\n\nTo maximize the area, we need to find the maximum value of 3x * sqrt(1 - (x/2)^2) for x > 0.\n\nStep 4: Let's denote the expression inside the square root as:\n\nf(x) = 1 - (x/2)^2\n\nThen, the area is:\n\nArea = (3x / 2) * sqrt(f(x))\n\nTo find the maximum, we can take the derivative of the area with respect to x and set it to zero.\n\nStep 5: Let's compute the derivative of the area:\n\nd(Area)/dx = (3/2) * sqrt(f(x)) + (3x / 2) * (1/2) * (1 - (x/2)^2)^(-1/2) * (-x/2)\n\nSimplifying:\n\nd(Area)/dx = (3/2) * sqrt(f(x)) + (3x / 4) * (1 - (x/2)^2)^(-1/2)\n\nSetting d(Area)/dx = 0:\n\n(3/2) * sqrt(f(x)) + (3x / 4) * (1 - (x/2)^2)^(-1/2) = 0\n\nStep 6: Let's denote the expression (1 - (x/2)^2)^(-1/2) as g(x):\n\ng(x) = (1 - (x/2)^2)^(-1/2)\n\nThen, the equation becomes:\n\n(3/2) * sqrt(f(x)) + (3x / 4) * g(x) = 0\n\nStep 7: Let's solve for x:\n\n(3/2) * sqrt(1 - (x/2)^2) + (3x / 4) * (1 - (x/2)^2)^(-1/2) = 0\n\nMultiplying both sides by 4:\n\n6 * sqrt(1 - (x/2)^2) + 3x * (1 - (x/2)^2)^(-1/2) = 0\n\nStep 8: Let's denote the expression (1 - (x/2)^2) as u:\n\nu = 1 - (x/2)^2\n\nThen, the equation becomes:\n\n6 * sqrt(u) + 3x * u^(-1/2) = 0\n\nStep 9: Let's rewrite the equation as:\n\n6 * sqrt(u) + 3x * u^(-1/2) = 0\n\nMultiplying both sides by sqrt(u):\n\n6 * u + 3x = 0\n\nStep 10: Let's solve for x:\n\n6 * u + 3x = 0\n\n3x = -6 * u\n\nx = -2 * u\n\nStep 11: Substitute u back in terms of x:\n\nu = 1 - (x/2)^2\n\nx = -2 * (1 - (x/2)^2)\n\nStep 12: Let's solve for x:\n\nx = -2 + 2 * (x/2)^2\n\nx = -2 + x^2 / 2\n\nStep 13: Rearranging the equation:\n\nx^2 / 2 - x - 2 = 0\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2:\n\nx^2 - 2x - 4 = 0\n\nStep 14: Let's solve the quadratic equation:\n\nx^2 - 2x - 4 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nHere, a = 1, b = -2, c = -4\n\nx = (2 \u00b1 sqrt((-2)^2 - 4(1)(-4))) / 2(1)\n\nx = (2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 + 16)) / 2\n\nx = (2 \u00b1 sqrt(20)) / 2\n\nx = (2 \u00b1 2sqrt(5)) / 2\n\nx = 1 \u00b1 sqrt(5)\n\nStep 15: Since x > 0, we take the positive solution:\n\nx = 1 + sqrt(5)\n\nStep 16: Now, we need to find the corresponding height h:\n\nh = sqrt(1 - (x/2)^2)\n\nSubstituting x = 1 + sqrt(5):\n\nh = sqrt(1 - ((1 + sqrt(5))/2)^2)\n\nStep 17: Let's compute the expression:\n\nh = sqrt(1 - ((1 + sqrt(5))/2)^2)\n\nExpanding the square:\n\nh = sqrt(1 - (1 + 2sqrt(5) + 5)/4)\n\nh = sqrt(1 - (6 + 2sqrt(5))/4)\n\nh = sqrt((4 - 6 - 2sqrt(5))/4)\n\nh = sqrt((-2 - 2sqrt(5))/4)\n\nh = sqrt(-1 - sqrt(5))\n\nStep 18: Since the height h must be real, the expression inside the square root must be non-negative.

  "Step 1: Problem Explanation\nWe are given a complex number $z$ such that $z\\otimes z = z^{2}+40$. We need to find the value of $|z|^2$.\n\nStep 2: \nTo solve this problem, we can start by expressing $z$ as $a+bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers. Then, we can substitute this into the equation $z\\otimes z = z^{2}+40$ and simplify. By equating the real and imaginary parts, we can obtain equations involving $a$ and $b$. Solving these equations will give us the values of $a$ and $b$, which we can then use to find $|z|^2$.\n\nStep 3: \nLet's express $z$ as $a+bi$. Then, $z\\otimes z = (a+bi)\\otimes (a+bi) = (a^2 - b^2) + (2ab)i$. On the other hand, $z^{2}+40 = (a+bi)^2 + 40 = (a^2 - b^2) + (2ab)i + 40$. Equating the real and imaginary parts, we get two equations: $a^2 - b^2 + 40 = 0$ and $2ab = 0$.\n\nStep 4: \nFrom the equation $2ab = 0$, we can conclude that either $a=0$ or $b=0$. If $a=0$, then $-b^2 + 40 = 0$, which gives $b^2 = 40$. If $b=0$, then $a^2 + 40 = 0$, which has no real solution for $a$. Therefore, $a=0$ and $b^2 = 40$.\n\nStep 5: \nSince $a=0$, $z$ is purely imaginary, so $z = bi$. Then, $|z|^2 = b^2$. Since $b^2 = 40$, we have $|z|^2 = 40$.\n\nStep 6: \nTherefore, the value of $|z|^2$ is 40.\n\nStep 7: \nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{40}",
  "Step 1: Problem Explanation\nWe are given a rectangular box P with distinct edge lengths a, b, and c. The sum of the lengths of all 12 edges is 13, the areas of all 6 faces is 11/2, and the volume is 1/2. We need to find the length of the longest interior diagonal connecting two vertices of P.\n\nStep 2: \nTo solve this problem, we can start by using the given information to set up equations involving the edge lengths a, b, and c. Then, we can use these equations to find the values of a, b, and c. Once we have the edge lengths, we can calculate the length of the longest interior diagonal using the formula for the diagonal of a rectangular box.\n\nStep 3: \nFirst, let's consider the sum of the lengths of all 12 edges. Since each edge is shared by two faces, the total sum is 4(a + b + c). We are given that this sum is 13, so we can write the equation:\n\n4(a + b + c) = 13\n\nDividing both sides by 4 gives:\n\na + b + c = 13/4\n\nStep 4: \nNext, let's consider the areas of all 6 faces. Each face is a rectangle with two edges of lengths a, b, and c. The total area is 2(ab + bc + ca). We are given that this area is 11/2, so we can write the equation:\n\n2(ab + bc + ca) = 11/2\n\nDividing both sides by 2 gives:\n\nab + bc + ca = 11/4\n\nStep 5: \nFinally, let's consider the volume of the box. The volume is abc. We are given that the volume is 1/2, so we can write the equation:\n\nabc = 1/2\n\nStep 6: \nNow we have three equations:\n\n1) a + b + c = 13/4\n2) ab + bc + ca = 11/4\n3) abc = 1/2\n\nWe can solve these equations to find the values of a, b, and c.\n\nStep 7: \nLet's start by solving equation (1) for c:\n\nc = 13/4 - a - b\n\nSubstituting this into equation (2):\n\nab + b(13/4 - a - b) + (13/4 - a - b)a = 11/4\n\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\nab + 13b/4 - ab - b^2 - 13a/4 + a^2 + ab = 11/4\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-a^2 - b^2 + 13a/4 + 13b/4 = 11/4\n\nMultiply both sides by 4 to eliminate fractions:\n\n-4a^2 - 4b^2 + 13a + 13b = 11\n\nRearrange terms:\n\n-4a^2 - 4b^2 + 13a + 13b - 11 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in a and b. Let's rewrite it as:\n\n-4(a^2 + b^2) + 13(a + b) - 11 = 0\n\nStep 8: \nNow we have a quadratic equation in a and b. Let's try to factor it:\n\n-4(a^2 + b^2) + 13(a + b) - 11 = 0\n\nLet's try to complete the square:\n\n-4(a^2 + b^2) + 13(a + b) - 11 = 0\n\nAdd 4 to both sides:\n\n-4(a^2 + b^2) + 13(a + b) = 11\n\nDivide by -4:\n\na^2 + b^2 - 13/4(a + b) + 11/4 = 0\n\nLet's try to complete the square:\n\na^2 + b^2 - 13/4(a + b) + 11/4 = 0\n\nLet's factor the left-hand side:\n\n(a + b)^2 - 13/4(a + b) + 11/4 = 0\n\nLet's let x = a + b. Then:\n\nx^2 - 13x/4 + 11/4 = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by 4 to eliminate fractions:\n\n4x^2 - 13x + 11 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in x. Let's solve it using the quadratic formula:\n\nx = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n\nIn this case, a = 4, b = -13, c = 11. Plugging these values into the formula:\n\nx = (13 \u00b1 sqrt((-13)^2 - 4(4)(11))) / (2(4))\n\nx = (13 \u00b1 sqrt(169 - 176)) / 8\n\nx = (13 \u00b1 sqrt(-7)) / 8\n\nSince sqrt(-7) is not a real number, this equation has no real solutions. Therefore, the original equation has no real solutions.\n\nHowever, since a, b, and c are lengths, they must be positive. Therefore, the sum a + b + c must be positive. But from equation (1), we have:\n\na + b + c = 13/4\n\nSince 13/4 is positive, a + b + c must be positive. Therefore, a, b, and c must be positive.\n\nBut since the original equation has no real solutions, this means that the problem has no real solutions. Therefore, the problem is inconsistent.\n\nHowever, the problem states that the final answer can be written in the form m/n, where m and n are relatively prime positive integers. Therefore, the problem must have a solution in the form m/n.\n\nBut since the problem is inconsistent, this means that there is no real solution. Therefore, the problem must have a non-real solution.\n\nBut since the problem states that the final answer can be written in the form m/n, where m and n are relatively prime positive integers, this means that the solution must be a rational number.\n\nTherefore, the problem must have a rational solution. But since the problem is inconsistent, this means that the problem has no real solution.

  "Step 1: To find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) of integers such that the polynomial x^3 + ax^2 + bx + 6 has 3 distinct integer roots, we can use Vieta's formulas.\n\nStep 2: Vieta's formulas state that for a cubic polynomial x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c with roots r, s, and t, the following relations hold:\n\nr + s + t = -a,\nrs + rt + st = b,\nrst = -c.\n\nIn this case, the polynomial is x^3 + ax^2 + bx + 6, so c = 6. Therefore, the product of the roots is -6.\n\nStep 3: Since the roots are distinct integers, we need to find all possible combinations of three distinct integers whose product is -6. Then, for each combination, we can compute the corresponding coefficients a and b using Vieta's formulas.\n\nStep 4: The possible combinations of three distinct integers whose product is -6 are:\n\n(1, -2, 3), (-1, 2, -3), (1, 2, -3), (-1, -2, 6), (1, -3, 2), (-1, 3, -2), (-2, 1, 3), (2, -1, -3), (-2, -1, 6), (2, 1, -3), (-3, 1, 2), (3, -1, -2), (-3, -2, 6), (3, 1, -2), (-6, 1, 1), (6, -1, -1), (-6, -1, 1), (6, 1, -1)\n\nStep 5: For each combination, we can compute the corresponding coefficients a and b using Vieta's formulas.

  "Step 1: Problem Explanation\nThe problem is asking us to find the value of the most expensive item in Coinland that cannot be purchased using the available coins with exact change. The available coins have values of 6, 10, and 15 cents. We need to determine the maximum value of an item that cannot be bought with these coins and then find the sum of its digits.\n\nStep 2: \nTo solve this problem, we can use the concept of linear Diophantine equations. The problem is equivalent to finding the largest number that cannot be expressed as a linear combination of 6, 10, and 15 with integer coefficients. In other words, we need to find the largest number x such that there are no integers a, b, and c satisfying the equation 6a + 10b + 15c = x.\n\nStep 3: \nFirst, let's find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 6, 10, and 15. The GCD will help us determine the maximum value that can be expressed as a linear combination of these numbers.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the coefficients\na = 6\nb = 10\nc = 15\n\n# Calculate the GCD\ngcd = math.gcd(math.gcd(a, b), c)\n```\n\nStep 4: \nThe GCD of 6, 10, and 15 is 1. Since the GCD is 1, any number that can be expressed as a linear combination of 6, 10, and 15 must be a multiple of the GCD, which is 1. Therefore, all numbers can be expressed as a linear combination of 6, 10, and 15 except for those that are not multiples of 1.\n\nStep 5: \nHowever, since the GCD is 1, every number can be expressed as a linear combination of 6, 10, and 15. Therefore, the largest number that cannot be expressed as a linear combination of 6, 10, and 15 is actually the largest number that is not a multiple of 1, which is infinity.

  "Step 1:  The problem states that triangle ABC has side lengths in arithmetic progression, with the smallest side being 6 units long. Additionally, the triangle has an angle of 120 degrees. We need to find the area of triangle ABC and then express it in the form m\u221an, where m and n are positive integers, and n is square-free. Finally, we have to find m + n.\nStep 2:  First, let's recall that in a triangle with sides in arithmetic progression, the sides can be represented as a - d, a, a + d, where a is the middle side and d is the common difference. Since the smallest side is 6, the sides are 6 - d, 6, 6 + d. Therefore, the sides are 6 - d, 6, 6 + d.\nStep 3:  The problem also mentions that the triangle has an angle of 120 degrees. Since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, the other two angles must add up to 60 degrees. Therefore, the triangle is isosceles with the base being 6 units long. The angle of 120 degrees is opposite the base, so the other two angles are equal and each is 30 degrees.\nStep 4:  Since the triangle is isosceles with base 6, the other two sides are equal. Therefore, the sides are 6 - d, 6, 6 + d. Since the triangle is isosceles, the two equal sides must be 6 - d and 6 + d. Therefore, 6 - d = 6 + d. Solving this equation gives 2d = 0, so d = 0.

Since the prices are discounted by 20%, the discounted price will be 80% of the original price, which is 0.8x. Then, a 7.5% sales tax is added to this discounted price, making the total price 1.075(0.8x).\n\nStep 3: Since Carlos has $43 to spend, the total price after discount and tax must be less than or equal to $43. So, we can set up the inequality 1.075(0.8x) \u2264 43.\n\nStep 4: To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the inequality. First, divide both sides by 1.075(0.8) = 0.8685. So, x \u2264 43 / 0.8685.\n\nStep 5: Calculate 43 / 0.8685 to find the maximum value of x.\n\nStep 6: Perform the division: 43 / 0.8685 \u2248 49.5.\n\nStep 7: Therefore, the original price of the most expensive shoes Carlos can afford is less than or equal to $49.5.\n\nStep 8: Since the problem asks for the original price of the most expensive shoes he can afford, the maximum value of x is $49.5.\n\nStep 9: Therefore, the final answer is the maximum value of x, which is $49.5.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{49.5}",

We need to find the value of n.\n\nStep 2: Recall the possible outcomes of rolling a single die\nEach standard six-sided die has the numbers 1 through 6.

  "Step 1: Problem Explanation\nWe are given that $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are positive integers satisfying several relations involving their least common multiples (LCM) and the product of all four numbers. We need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$.\n\nStep 2: \nTo find the GCD of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$, we can use the fact that the GCD of a set of numbers is equal to the product of the common prime factors raised to the smallest power among all numbers. Since the LCM of two numbers is equal to the product of the two numbers divided by their GCD, we can use the given LCMs to find the GCD.\n\nStep 3: \nFirst, let's express the LCMs in terms of the prime factorization of the numbers. Let's denote the prime factorization of $a$ as $2^{a_2} \\cdot 3^{a_3} \\cdot 5^{a_5}$, $b$ as $2^{b_2} \\cdot 3^{b_3} \\cdot 5^{b_5}$, $c$ as $2^{c_2} \\cdot 3^{c_3} \\cdot 5^{c_5}$, and $d$ as $2^{d_2} \\cdot 3^{d_3} \\cdot 5^{d_5}$.\n\nStep 4: \nFrom the given LCMs, we can write the following equations:\n\n- LCM(a, b) = 2^3 * 3^2 * 5^3\n- LCM(a, c) = 2^3 * 3^3 * 5^3\n- LCM(a, d) = 2^3 * 3^3 * 5^3\n- LCM(b, c) = 2^1 * 3^3 * 5^2\n- LCM(b, d) = 2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2\n- LCM(c, d) = 2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2\n\nStep 5: \nWe can use these equations to find the exponents of the common prime factors among the numbers. For example, the LCM(a, b) = 2^3 * 3^2 * 5^3 implies that the highest power of 2 in a and b is 3, the highest power of 3 is 2, and the highest power of 5 is 3. Similarly, we can deduce the exponents for the other LCMs.\n\nStep 6: \nLet's start with the LCM(a, b) = 2^3 * 3^2 * 5^3. This implies that the highest power of 2 in a and b is 3, the highest power of 3 is 2, and the highest power of 5 is 3. Similarly, from LCM(a, c) = 2^3 * 3^3 * 5^3, we get that the highest power of 2 is 3, the highest power of 3 is 3, and the highest power of 5 is 3. Similarly, from LCM(a, d) = 2^3 * 3^3 * 5^3, we get the same exponents. Therefore, the highest power of 2 in a is 3, the highest power of 3 is 3, and the highest power of 5 is 3.\n\nStep 7: \nSimilarly, from LCM(b, c) = 2^1 * 3^3 * 5^2, we get that the highest power of 2 in b and c is 1, the highest power of 3 is 3, and the highest power of 5 is 2. Similarly, from LCM(b, d) = 2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2, we get that the highest power of 2 in b and d is 2, the highest power of 3 is 3, and the highest power of 5 is 2. Similarly, from LCM(c, d) = 2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2, we get that the highest power of 2 in c and d is 2, the highest power of 3 is 3, and the highest power of 5 is 2.\n\nStep 8: \nTherefore, the exponents of the common prime factors among a, b, c, and d are:\n\n- For 2: The highest power in a is 3, in b is 2, in c is 2, and in d is 2. Therefore, the highest power of 2 among all numbers is 3.\n- For 3: The highest power in a is 3, in b is 2, in c is 3, and in d is 3. Therefore, the highest power of 3 among all numbers is 3.\n- For 5: The highest power in a is 3, in b is 3, in c is 2, and in d is 2. Therefore, the highest power of 5 among all numbers is 3.\n\nStep 9: \nTherefore, the GCD(a, b, c, d) is equal to 2^3 * 3^3 * 5^3.\n\nStep 10: \nTherefore, the GCD(a, b, c, d) is 2^3 * 3^3 * 5^3 = 8 * 27 * 125 = 21600.\n\nStep 11: \nTherefore, the GCD(a, b, c, d) is 21600.\n\nStep 12: \nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{21600}",
  "Step 1: Problem Explanation\nWe are given two right triangles inscribed in circles A and B. The first triangle is a 3-4-5 right triangle, and the second is a 5-12-13 right triangle. We need to find the ratio of the area of circle A to the area of circle B. The final answer should be in the form m/n, where m and n are relatively prime positive integers. Then, we need to find m + n.\n\nStep 2: \nTo find the ratio of the areas of the two circles, we need to find the radii of the circles. Since the triangles are inscribed in the circles, the hypotenuse of each triangle is the diameter of the respective circle. Therefore, the radius of each circle is half the length of the hypotenuse.\n\nStep 3: \nFor the 3-4-5 right triangle, the hypotenuse is 5. So, the radius of circle A is 5/2.\n\nStep 4: \nSimilarly, for the 5-12-13 right triangle, the hypotenuse is 13. So, the radius of circle B is 13/2.\n\nStep 5: \nThe area of a circle is given by the formula A = \u03c0r^2, where r is the radius. Therefore, the area of circle A is \u03c0(5/2)^2, and the area of circle B is \u03c0(13/2)^2.\n\nStep 6: \nTo find the ratio of the areas, we can divide the area of circle A by the area of circle B. So, the ratio is (\u03c0(5/2)^2) / (\u03c0(13/2)^2).\n\nStep 7: \nSimplifying the ratio, we can cancel out \u03c0 and the squared terms. So, the ratio becomes (5/2)^2 / (13/2)^2.\n\nStep 8: \nSimplifying further, (5/2)^2 = 25/4, and (13/2)^2 = 169/4. So, the ratio is (25/4) / (169/4).\n\nStep 9: \nDividing by 4 in both numerator and denominator, the ratio becomes 25/169.\n\nStep 10: \nTherefore, the ratio of the area of circle A to the area of circle B is 25/169.\n\nStep 11: \nSince the ratio is 25/169, which is already in the form m/n where m and n are relatively prime positive integers, m = 25 and n = 169. Therefore, m + n = 25 + 169 = 194.\n\nStep 12: \nSo, the final answer is m + n = 194.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{194}",
  "Step 1: First, let's understand the problem. Jackson has a paintbrush that creates a narrow strip with a width of 6.5 millimeters. He has enough paint to make a strip 25 meters long. We need to find out how many square centimeters of paper Jackson could cover with paint.\n\nStep 2: To solve this problem, we need to convert the length of the strip from meters to centimeters, since the width is given in millimeters and we want the area in square centimeters. Then, we can calculate the area of the strip by multiplying the length and width.\n\nStep 3: First, let's convert the length from meters to centimeters. Since 1 meter = 100 centimeters, 25 meters = 25 * 100 = 2500 centimeters.\n\nStep 4: Now, we have the length in centimeters (2500 cm) and the width in millimeters (6.5 mm). To find the area, we need to convert the width from millimeters to centimeters. Since 1 centimeter = 10 millimeters, 6.5 mm = 6.5 / 10 = 0.65 cm.\n\nStep 5: Now that we have the length (2500 cm) and width (0.65 cm), we can calculate the area by multiplying the length and width: Area = length * width = 2500 * 0.65 = 1625 square centimeters.\n\nStep 6: Therefore, Jackson could cover 1625 square centimeters of paper with paint.\n\nStep 7: So, the final answer is \\boxed{1625}",

The goal is to find at least one square that is covered by the rectangle using the minimum number of turns. In each turn, a square is guessed, and the response is whether that square is covered by the rectangle.\n\nStep 2: Determine the total number of squares in the grid\nThe grid is $3 \\times 3$, so there are $3 \\times 3 = 9$ squares in total.\n\nStep 3: Consider the possible positions of the rectangle\nThe rectangle is $2 \\times 1$, so it can be placed in two possible orientations: horizontally or vertically.

  "To solve this problem, we need to understand the behavior of the polynomial P(x) when its roots are removed. The roots of P(x) are at x = 1, 2, 3, ..., 10, each with a multiplicity of 1, 2, 3, ..., 10, respectively. When these roots are removed, the number line is divided into 11 disjoint open intervals. We need to determine how many of these intervals have P(x) positive.\n\nFirst, let's recall that the sign of a polynomial in an interval can be determined by the number of sign changes in the coefficients of the polynomial when written in descending order of powers. However, since P(x) is a product of linear factors, we can analyze the sign of each factor in each interval.\n\nLet's denote the intervals as I1, I2, ..., I11, where I1 is the interval (\u2212\u221e, 1), I2 is (1, 2), and so on, up to I11 being (10, \u221e). We need to determine the sign of P(x) in each interval.\n\nSince P(x) is a product of linear factors, the sign of P(x) in each interval is determined by the signs of the factors in that interval. For example, in interval I1, the factors are (x-1), (x-2)^2, ..., (x-10)^10. Since x < 1 in I1, all factors are negative, so P(x) is negative in I1.\n\nSimilarly, in interval I2, x is between 1 and 2, so (x-1) is positive, (x-2)^2 is positive, and so on. Therefore, the sign of P(x) in I2 is positive.\n\nContinuing this way, we can determine the sign of P(x) in each interval.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the fact that the sign of P(x) in an interval is determined by the number of sign changes in the sequence of signs of the factors. Since each factor is linear, the sign of each factor is either positive or negative. Therefore, the sign of P(x) in an interval is positive if the number of sign changes in the sequence of signs of the factors is even, and negative if the number of sign changes is odd.\n\nLet's compute the number of sign changes in each interval.\n\nInterval I1: (\u2212\u221e, 1). All factors are negative, so P(x) is negative.\n\nInterval I2: (1, 2). (x-1) is positive, (x-2)^2 is positive, and so on. Therefore, the number of sign changes is 1 (from negative to positive), so P(x) is positive.\n\nInterval I3: (2, 3). (x-1) is positive, (x-2)^2 is positive, (x-3)^3 is negative. Therefore, the number of sign changes is 1 (from positive to negative), so P(x) is negative.\n\nInterval I4: (3, 4). (x-1) is positive, (x-2)^2 is positive, (x-3)^3 is negative, (x-4)^4 is positive. Therefore, the number of sign changes is 1 (from negative to positive), so P(x) is positive.\n\nInterval I5: (4, 5). (x-1) is positive, (x-2)^2 is positive, (x-3)^3 is negative, (x-4)^4 is positive, (x-5)^5 is negative. Therefore, the number of sign changes is 1 (from positive to negative), so P(x) is negative.\n\nInterval I6: (5, 6). (x-1) is positive, (x-2)^2 is positive, (x-3)^3 is negative, (x-4)^4 is positive, (x-5)^5 is negative, (x-6)^6 is positive. Therefore, the number of sign changes is 1 (from negative to positive), so P(x) is positive.\n\nInterval I7: (6, 7). (x-1) is positive, (x-2)^2 is positive, (x-3)^3 is negative, (x-4)^4 is positive, (x-5)^5 is negative, (x-6)^6 is positive, (x-7)^7 is negative. Therefore, the number of sign changes is 1 (from positive to negative), so P(x) is negative.\n\nInterval I8: (7, 8). (x-1) is positive, (x-2)^2 is positive, (x-3)^3 is negative, (x-4)^4 is positive, (x-5)^5 is negative, (x-6)^6 is positive, (x-7)^7 is negative, (x-8)^8 is positive. Therefore, the number of sign changes is 1 (from negative to positive), so P(x) is positive.\n\nInterval I9: (8, 9). (x-1) is positive, (x-2)^2 is positive, (x-3)^3 is negative, (x-4)^4 is positive, (x-5)^5 is negative, (x-6)^6 is positive, (x-7)^7 is negative, (x-8)^8 is positive, (x-9)^9 is negative. Therefore, the number of sign changes is 1 (from positive to negative), so P(x) is negative.\n\nInterval I10: (9, 10). (x-1) is positive, (x-2)^2 is positive, (x-3)^3 is negative, (x-4)^4 is positive, (x-5)^5 is negative, (x-6)^6 is positive, (x-7)^7 is negative, (x-8)^8 is positive, (x-9)^9 is negative, (x-10)^10 is positive. Therefore, the number of sign changes is 1 (from negative to positive), so P(x) is positive.\n\nInterval I11: (10, \u221e). (x-1) is positive, (x-2)^2 is positive, (x-3)^3 is negative, (x-4)^4 is positive, (x-5)^5 is negative, (x-6)^6 is positive, (x-7)^7 is negative, (x-8)^8 is positive, (x-9)^9 is negative, (x-10)^10 is positive. Therefore, the number of sign changes is 1 (from negative to positive), so P(x) is positive.\n\nTherefore, the intervals where P(x) is positive are I2, I4, I6, I8, I10, and I11. Therefore, the number of intervals where P(x) is positive is 6.\n\nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{6}",

Since \\log (n^2) = 2\\log n, we can rewrite the numerator as 2\\log n - (\\log n)^2.\n\nStep 4: The denominator is \\log n - 3. So the expression becomes \\[\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\log n - (\\log n)^2}{\\log n - 3}}.\\]\n\nStep 5: To ensure that the expression is real, the numerator must be non-negative, and the denominator must be positive.\n\nStep 6: Let's first consider the numerator: 2\\log n - (\\log n)^2. This is a quadratic expression in terms of \\log n. Let's denote \\log n as x. Then the numerator becomes 2x - x^2.\n\nStep 7: The quadratic expression 2x - x^2 can be factored as x(2 - x). So the numerator is x(2 - x). For the numerator to be non-negative, x(2 - x) \u2265 0.\n\nStep 8: The quadratic expression x(2 - x) is non-negative when x is between 0 and 2, inclusive. So 0 \u2264 x \u2264 2.\n\nStep 9: Since x = \\log n, the condition 0 \u2264 x \u2264 2 translates to 10^0 \u2264 n \u2264 10^2, which is 1 \u2264 n \u2264 100.\n\nStep 10: Therefore, the numerator is non-negative for 1 \u2264 n \u2264 100.\n\nStep 11: Next, let's consider the denominator: \\log n - 3. For the expression to be real, the denominator must be positive, so \\log n - 3 > 0.\n\nStep 12: Solving \\log n - 3 > 0, we get \\log n > 3. Taking 10 to the power of both sides, we get n > 10^3, which is n > 1000.\n\nStep 13: Therefore, the denominator is positive for n > 1000.\n\nStep 14: However, we also need to consider the case where the denominator is zero, which would make the expression undefined. So we need to exclude n = 1000.\n\nStep 15: Therefore, the expression is real for 1 \u2264 n \u2264 1000, excluding n = 1000.\n\nStep 16: So the number of integers n for which the expression is real is 1000 - 1 = 999.\n\nStep 17: Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{999}",
  "Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe need to find the number of nonempty subsets B of the set {0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 12} such that the number of elements in B is equal to the least element of B.\n\nStep 2: Identify the possible least elements\nSince the least element of B must be equal to the number of elements in B, the least element can be 1, 2, 3, ..., 12. However, since the set is {0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 12}, the least element cannot be 0 because the number of elements in B cannot be 0 (since B is nonempty). Therefore, the possible least elements are 1, 2, 3, ..., 12.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the number of subsets for each possible least element\nFor each possible least element k, the number of elements in B is k. Therefore, the remaining elements in B must be k-1 elements chosen from the set {k+1, k+2, ..., 12}. This is a combination problem, where we need to choose k-1 elements from 12-k elements.\n\nStep 4: Compute the number of subsets for each k\nFor each k from 1 to 12, compute the number of subsets with k elements, where the least element is k. This is given by the combination formula C(12-k, k-1).\n\nStep 5: Sum the number of subsets for each k\nTo find the total number of subsets B that satisfy the condition, we need to sum the number of subsets for each k from 1 to 12.\n\nStep 6: Compute the sum\nLet's compute the sum:\n\nC(11, 0) + C(10, 1) + C(9, 2) + C(8, 3) + C(7, 4) + C(6, 5) + C(5, 6) + C(4, 7) + C(3, 8) + C(2, 9) + C(1, 10) + C(0, 11)\n\nUsing the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!) where n! denotes the factorial of n.\n\nStep 7: Compute each term\nLet's compute each term:\n\nC(11, 0) = 11! / (0! * 11!) = 1\n\nC(10, 1) = 10! / (1! * 9!) = 10\n\nC(9, 2) = 9! / (2! * 7!) = 36\n\nC(8, 3) = 8! / (3! * 5!) = 56\n\nC(7, 4) = 7! / (4! * 3!) = 35\n\nC(6, 5) = 6! / (5! * 1!) = 6\n\nC(5, 6) = 0 (since 6 > 5)\n\nC(4, 7) = 0 (since 7 > 4)\n\nC(3, 8) = 0 (since 8 > 3)\n\nC(2, 9) = 0 (since 9 > 2)\n\nC(1, 10) = 0 (since 10 > 1)\n\nC(0, 11) = 0 (since 11 > 0)\n\nStep 8: Sum the terms\nSum the computed terms:\n\n1 + 10 + 36 + 56 + 35 + 6 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 144\n\nTherefore, the total number of nonempty subsets B of {0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 12} such that the number of elements in B is equal to the least element of B is 144.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{144}",
  "Step 1: The problem asks for the area of the region in the coordinate plane defined by the inequality \\(| | x | - 1 | + | | y | - 1 | \\le 1\\). To solve this, we need to understand the geometric shape described by this inequality.\n\nStep 2: The inequality involves absolute values, which typically correspond to distances from the origin. The expression \\(| | x | - 1 | + | | y | - 1 | \\le 1\\) can be interpreted as the sum of the distances from the point \\((x, y)\\) to the points \\((1, 0)\\) and \\((0, 1)\\) being less than or equal to 1. This suggests that the region is bounded by the lines connecting these points and the axes.\n\nStep 3: Let's break down the inequality into four cases based on the signs of \\(x - 1\\) and \\(y - 1\\). This will help us visualize the region.\n\nCase 1: When \\(x \\ge 1\\) and \\(y \\ge 1\\), the inequality becomes \\(|x - 1| + |y - 1| \\le 1\\). This is the region in the first quadrant where the sum of the distances from \\((1, 1)\\) to \\((x, y)\\) is less than or equal to 1. This is a square with vertices at \\((1, 1)\\), \\((2, 1)\\), \\((2, 2)\\), and \\((1, 2)\\). The area of this square is \\((2 - 1)^2 = 1\\).\n\nCase 2: When \\(x \\ge 1\\) and \\(y < 1\\), the inequality becomes \\(|x - 1| + |1 - y| \\le 1\\). This is the region in the first quadrant where the sum of the distances from \\((1, 1)\\) to \\((x, y)\\) is less than or equal to 1. This is a square with vertices at \\((1, 1)\\), \\((2, 1)\\), \\((2, 0)\\), and \\((1, 0)\\). The area of this square is \\((2 - 1)^2 = 1\\).\n\nCase 3: When \\(x < 1\\) and \\(y \\ge 1\\), the inequality becomes \\(|1 - x| + |y - 1| \\le 1\\). This is the region in the first quadrant where the sum of the distances from \\((1, 1)\\) to \\((x, y)\\) is less than or equal to 1. This is a square with vertices at \\((1, 1)\\), \\((0, 1)\\), \\((0, 2)\\), and \\((1, 2)\\). The area of this square is \\((1 - 0)^2 = 1\\).\n\nCase 4: When \\(x < 1\\) and \\(y < 1\\), the inequality becomes \\(|1 - x| + |1 - y| \\le 1\\). This is the region in the first quadrant where the sum of the distances from \\((1, 1)\\) to \\((x, y)\\) is less than or equal to 1. This is a square with vertices at \\((1, 1)\\), \\((0, 1)\\), \\((0, 0)\\), and \\((1, 0)\\). The area of this square is \\((1 - 0)^2 = 1\\).\n\nStep 4: Since the inequality is symmetric with respect to the x-axis and y-axis, the region is symmetric about both axes. Therefore, the total area is four times the area of one of the squares, which is 4 * 1 = 4.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, the area of the region defined by the inequality is 4.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{4}"
