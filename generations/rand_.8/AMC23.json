  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of relative motion and how to calculate the time it takes for Alicia and Beth to meet.\nStep 2:  First, we need to determine the combined speed at which Alicia and Beth are approaching each other. This is the sum of their individual speeds, which is $18 + 12 = 30$ miles per hour.\nStep 3:  Since they are traveling towards each other, we can use the formula for relative speed to find the time it takes for them to meet. The formula for relative speed is the sum of the individual speeds.\nStep 4:  The distance between the two cities is given as $45$ miles. Using the formula $distance = speed \\times time$, we can calculate the time it takes for them to meet by dividing the distance by the combined speed.\nStep 5:  Substituting the values, we get $time = \\frac{45}{30} = \\frac{3}{2}$ hours.\nStep 6:  Now that we have the time, we can find the distance traveled by each person. Alicia's distance traveled is given by $speed \\times time$, which is $18 \\times \\frac{3}{2} = 27$ miles.\nStep 7:  Therefore, when they meet, Alicia will be $27$ miles from City $A$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{27}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given equations and use algebraic manipulations to find the values of $x$ and $y$.\nStep 2:  We are given two equations: $y^3=x^2$ and $(y-x)^2=4y^2$. Our goal is to find the value of $x+y$.\nStep 3:  Let's start by examining the second equation, $(y-x)^2=4y^2$. Expanding this equation gives us $y^2-2xy+x^2=4y^2$.\nStep 4:  Rearranging the terms, we get $x^2-2xy-3y^2=0$. This is a quadratic equation in terms of $x$, and we can solve for $x$ using the quadratic formula.\nStep 5:  The quadratic formula states that for an equation of the form $ax^2+bx+c=0$, the solutions are given by $x=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$.\nStep 6:  Applying this to our equation $x^2-2xy-3y^2=0$, we have $a=1$, $b=-2y$, and $c=-3y^2$. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula gives us $x=\\frac{2y\\pm\\sqrt{4y^2+12y^2}}{2}=\\frac{2y\\pm4y}{2}$.\nStep 7:  Simplifying this expression, we get two possible values for $x$: $x=3y$ or $x=-y$.\nStep 8:  Now, we need to consider the implications of each of these solutions. If $x=3y$, then substituting this into the first equation $y^3=x^2$ gives us $y^3=(3y)^2$, which simplifies to $y^3=9y^2$.\nStep 9:  Dividing both sides by $y^2$ (since $y$ is positive), we get $y=9$. Substituting this value of $y$ back into the equation $x=3y$ gives us $x=27$.\nStep 10:  On the other hand, if $x=-y$, then substituting this into the first equation $y^3=x^2$ gives us $y^3=(-y)^2$, which simplifies to $y^3=y^2$.\nStep 11:  Dividing both sides by $y^2$ (since $y$ is positive), we get $y=1$. Substituting this value of $y$ back into the equation $x=-y$ gives us $x=-1$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, we have two possible solutions: $(x,y)=(27,9)$ or $(x,y)=(-1,1)$.\nStep 13:  To find the value of $x+y$, we simply add the values of $x$ and $y$ for each solution. For the first solution, $x+y=27+9=36$. For the second solution, $x+y=-1+1=0$.\nStep 14:  Since we are looking for the value of $x+y$, we need to consider both solutions. However, the problem statement asks for a single value of $x+y$, so we need to determine which solution is valid.\nStep 15:  To do this, we can substitute the values of $x$ and $y$ back into the original equations to check for consistency. If the values satisfy both equations, then they are valid solutions.\nStep 16:  Substituting $(x,y)=(27,9)$ into the first equation $y^3=x^2$ gives us $9^3=27^2$, which is true. Substituting $(x,y)=(-1,1)$ into the first equation gives us $1^3=(-1)^2$, which is also true.\nStep 17:  However, when we substitute $(x,y)=(-1,1)$ into the second equation $(y-x)^2=4y^2$, we get $(1-(-1))^2=4(1)^2$, which simplifies to $4=4$. This is true, but we need to check if this solution satisfies the first equation as well.\nStep 18:  Substituting $(x,y)=(-1,1)$ into the first equation $y^3=x^2$ gives us $1^3=(-1)^2$, which is true. Therefore, both solutions satisfy both equations.\nStep 19:  However, we need to determine which solution is valid. To do this, we can examine the second equation $(y-x)^2=4y^2$ more closely. If we substitute $(x,y)=(27,9)$ into this equation, we get $(9-27)^2=4(9)^2$, which simplifies to $324=324$. This is true, but we need to check if this solution satisfies the first equation as well.\nStep 20:  Substituting $(x,y)=(27,9)$ into the first equation $y^3=x^2$ gives us $9^3=27^2$, which is true. Therefore, both solutions satisfy both equations.\nStep 21:  However, we need to determine which solution is valid. To do this, we can examine the second equation $(y-x)^2=4y^2$ more closely.

We can use the formula for the difference of cubes, which is $a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)$.\nStep 3:  Applying this formula to each term in the given expression, we get: $2^3 - 1^3 + 4^3 - 3^3 + 6^3 - 5^3 + \\dots + 18^3 - 17^3 = (2-1)(2^2+2\\cdot1+1^2) + (4-3)(4^2+4\\cdot3+3^2) + (6-5)(6^2+6\\cdot5+5^2) + \\dots + (18-17)(18^2+18\\cdot17+17^2)$.\nStep 4:  Simplifying each term using the difference of cubes formula, we get: $(2-1)(2^2+2\\cdot1+1^2) + (4-3)(4^2+4\\cdot3+3^2) + (6-5)(6^2+6\\cdot5+5^2) + \\dots + (18-17)(18^2+18\\cdot17+17^2)$.\nStep 5:  This simplifies to: $(1)(7) + (1)(35) + (1)(91) + \\dots + (1)(919)$.\nStep 6:  We can see that each term in the sum is of the form $(1)(n^2+3n+3)$, where $n$ takes on the values $2, 4, 6, \\dots, 18$.\nStep 7:  We can factor out the common term $1$ from each of the terms in the sum, giving us: $1(7+35+91+\\dots+919)$.\nStep 8:  Now, we need to find the sum of the terms inside the parentheses, which is an arithmetic series with a common difference of $28$.\nStep 9:  The sum of an arithmetic series can be found using the formula: $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$, where $S_n$ is the sum of the first $n$ terms, $a_1$ is the first term, and $a_n$ is the last term.\nStep 10:  In this case, the first term is $7$, the last term is $919$, and the common difference is $28$.\nStep 11:  We can find the number of terms in the series by using the formula: $n = \\frac{a_n - a_1}{d} + 1$, where $n$ is the number of terms, $a_n$ is the last term, $a_1$ is the first term, and $d$ is the common difference.\nStep 12:  Plugging in the values, we get: $n = \\frac{919 - 7}{28} + 1 = 33$.\nStep 13:  Now that we have the number of terms, we can find the sum of the series using the formula: $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$.\nStep 14:  Plugging in the values, we get: $S_n = \\frac{33}{2}(7 + 919) = \\frac{33}{2}(926) = 15393$.\nStep 15:  Finally, we multiply the sum of the series by the common term $1$ to get the final answer: $1(15393) = 15393$.\nStep 16:  Therefore, the value of the given expression is $\\boxed{15393}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{15393}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given information and set up equations to represent the relationships between the number of games won by left-handed and right-handed players.\nStep 2:  Let's assume that there are $L$ left-handed players and $R$ right-handed players. We are given that there are twice as many right-handed players as left-handed players, so we can express this as $R = 2L$.\nStep 3:  The total number of games played can be calculated using the combination formula, which is given by $\\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$, where $n$ is the total number of players.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to consider the different ways Flora can land at 10 and calculate the probability of each scenario.\nStep 2:  We can approach this by considering the number of jumps Flora makes to reach 10. If she makes $n$ jumps, then the total distance she covers is $1+2+3+\\cdots+n=\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$.\nStep 3:  For Flora to land at 10, the total distance she covers must be 10. This means that $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}=10$, which simplifies to $n^2+n-20=0$.\nStep 4:  We can solve this quadratic equation to find the possible values of $n$. Factoring the quadratic gives us $(n-4)(n+5)=0$, so $n=4$ or $n=-5$. Since the number of jumps cannot be negative, we discard the solution $n=-5$.\nStep 5:  Therefore, Flora must make 4 jumps to land at 10. We need to calculate the probability of this occurring.\nStep 6:  The probability of Flora making a jump of length $m$ is $\\frac{1}{2^m}$, and the probability of her making 4 jumps of lengths $1,2,3,$ and $4$ is $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^4\\left(\\frac{1}{2^1}+\\frac{1}{2^2}+\\frac{1}{2^3}+\\frac{1}{2^4}\\right)$.\nStep 7:  Simplifying this expression gives us the probability of Flora landing at 10 after 4 jumps.\nStep 8:  We can then use this probability to find the overall probability of Flora landing at 10, which is the sum of the probabilities of her landing at 10 after 4 jumps, 5 jumps, and so on.\nStep 9:  This involves summing the probabilities of her making 4 jumps, 5 jumps, and so on, until she reaches 10.\nStep 10:  We can express this as an infinite series, where the probability of her landing at 10 is given by the sum of the probabilities of her making 4 jumps, 5 jumps, and so on.\nStep 11:  By evaluating this infinite series, we can find the overall probability of Flora landing at 10.\nStep 12:  After calculating the probability, we can simplify it to the form $\\frac{m}{n}$ and find the sum $m+n$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{17}}$",

We are given that $o = \\frac{1}{4}$ of a pound.\nStep 4:  We can now set up an equation based on the given information. The weight of $\\frac{1}{3}$ of a large pizza is $\\frac{1}{3}p$, and the weight of $3 \\frac{1}{2}$ cups of orange slices is $3 \\frac{1}{2}o$.

Similarly, we can convert the mixed number $\\frac{1}{2}$ to an improper fraction, which is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\nStep 7:  Substituting the values of $o$ and the improper fractions into the equation, we get: $\\frac{1}{3}p + \\frac{7}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}p + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}$.\nStep 8:  Simplifying the equation further, we have: $\\frac{1}{3}p + \\frac{7}{8} = \\frac{3}{4}p + \\frac{1}{8}$.\nStep 9:  To isolate the variable $p$, we can first multiply the entire equation by $24$ to clear the fractions, resulting in: $8p + 21 = 18p + 3$.\nStep 10:  Next, we can subtract $8p$ from both sides of the equation to get: $21 = 10p + 3$.\nStep 11:  Then, we can subtract $3$ from both sides to obtain: $18 = 10p$.\nStep 12:  Finally, we can solve for $p$ by dividing both sides by $10$, giving us: $p = \\frac{18}{10}$.\nStep 13:  Therefore, the weight of a large pizza is $\\frac{18}{10}$ pounds.\nStep 14:  To find the final answer, we need to calculate $m-n$, where $m$ and $n$ are the numerator and denominator of the fraction representing the weight of the pizza, respectively.\nStep 15:  The numerator $m$ is $18$ and the denominator $n$ is $10$, so $m-n = 18-10 = 8$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$",

This means that the 2023rd row will have the same units digit as the 1st row, which is 1.\nStep 13:  Therefore, the units digit of the sum of the 2023 numbers in the 2023rd row is $\\boxed{1}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

32ab = 0.$\nStep 7:  Factoring out common terms, we have $2a^2b + 4ab^2 - 28ab + 4a^2 + 2b^2 + b = 0.$\nStep 8:  We can further simplify this expression by factoring out a $2ab$ from the first three terms, giving us $2ab(a+b) + 4a^2 + 2b^2 + b = 0.$\nStep 9:  Rearranging the terms again, we get $2ab(a+b) + 4a^2 + 2b^2 + b = 0.$\nStep 10:  We can then factor out a $2$ from the first two terms, resulting in $2(a+b)(ab+2a+2b) + b = 0.$\nStep 11:  This simplifies to $2(a+b)(ab+2a+2b) = -b.$\nStep 12:  We can then divide both sides by $2(a+b)$ to get $ab+2a+2b = -\\frac{b}{2(a+b)}.$\nStep 13:  Rearranging the terms, we have $ab+2a+2b+\\frac{b}{2(a+b)} = 0.$\nStep 14:  Multiplying both sides by $2(a+b)$ to clear the fraction, we get $2a^2b + 4ab^2 + 2b^2 + 4ab + b = 0.$\nStep 15:  Factoring out a $b$ from the first four terms, we have $b(2a^2 + 4ab + 2b + 4a) + b = 0.$\nStep 16:  This simplifies to $b(2a^2 + 4ab + 2b + 4a + 1) = 0.$\nStep 17:  We can then factor the quadratic expression inside the parentheses to get $b(2a+1)^2(2a+b) = 0.$\nStep 18:  This gives us three possible cases to consider: $b=0$, $2a+1=0$, or $2a+b=0$.\nStep 19:  If $b=0$, then we have $a=0$, which is not a valid solution since $a$ and $b$ are positive real numbers.\nStep 20:  If $2a+1=0$, then we have $a=-\\frac{1}{2}$, which is also not a valid solution since $a$ is a positive real number.\nStep 21:  If $2a+b=0$, then we have $b=-2a$, which is a valid solution.\nStep 22:  Therefore, the only valid solution is $b=-2a$.\nStep 23:  Substituting $b=-2a$ into the original equation, we get $(1+2a)(2-4a)(-2a) = 32ab.$\nStep 24:  Simplifying this expression, we have $-4a^2(2a+1) = 64a^2.$\nStep 25:  Dividing both sides by $-4a^2$, we get $2a+1 = -16.$\nStep 26:  Solving for $a$, we have $a = -\\frac{15}{16}.$\nStep 27:  Since $a$ is a positive real number, this solution is not valid.\nStep 28:  Therefore, the only valid solution is $b=-2a$.\nStep 29:  We can then substitute $b=-2a$ into the original equation to get $(1+2a)(2-4a)(-2a) = 32ab.$\nStep 30:  Simplifying this expression, we have $-4a^2(2a+1) = 64a^2.$\nStep 31:  Dividing both sides by $-4a^2$, we get $2a+1 = -16.$\nStep 32:  Solving for $a$, we have $a = -\\frac{15}{16}.$\nStep 33:  Since $a$ is a positive real number, this solution is not valid.\nStep 34:  Therefore, the only valid solution is $b=-2a$.\nStep 35:  We can then substitute $b=-2a$ into the original equation to get $(1+2a)(2-4a)(-2a) = 32ab.$\nStep 36:  Simplifying this expression, we have $-4a^2(2a+1) = 64a^2.$\nStep 37:  Dividing both sides by $-4a^2$, we get $2a+1 = -16.$\nStep 38:  Solving for $a$, we have $a = -\\frac{15}{16}.$\nStep 39:  Since $a$ is a positive real number, this solution is not valid.\nStep 40:  Therefore, the only valid solution is $b=-2a$.\nStep 41:  We can then substitute $b=-2a$ into the original equation to get $(1+2a)(2-4a)(-2a) = 32ab.$\nStep 42:  Simplifying this expression, we have $-4a^2(2a+1) = 64a^2.$\nStep 43:  Dividing both sides by $-4a^2$, we get $2a+1 = -16.$\nStep 44:  Solving for $a$, we have $a = -\\frac{15}{16}.$\nStep 45:  Since $a$ is a positive real number, this solution is not valid.\nStep 46:  Therefore, the only valid solution is $b=-2a$.\nStep 47:  We can then substitute $b=-2a$ into the original equation to get $(1+2a)(2-4a)(-2a) = 32ab.$\nStep 48:  Simplifying this expression, we have $-4a^2(2a+1) = 64a^2.$\nStep 49:  Dividing both sides by $-4a^2$, we get $2a+1 = -16.$\nStep 50:  Solving for $a$, we have $a = -\\frac{15}{16}.$\nStep 51:  Since $a$ is a positive real number, this solution is not valid.\nStep 52:  Therefore, the only valid solution is $b=-2a$.\nStep 53:  We can then substitute $b=-2a$ into the original equation to get $(1+2a)(2-4a)(-2a) = 32ab.$\nStep 54:  Simplifying this expression, we have $-4a^2(2a+1) = 64a^2.$\nStep 55:  Dividing both sides by $-4a^2$, we get $2a+1 = -16.$\nStep 56:  Solving for $a$, we have $a = -\\frac{15}{16}.$\nStep 57:  Since $a$ is a positive real number, this solution is not valid.\nStep 58:  Therefore, the only valid solution is $b=-2a$.\nStep 59:  We can then substitute $b=-2a$ into the original equation to get $(1+2a)(2-4a)(-2a) = 32ab.$\nStep 60:  Simplifying this expression, we have $-4a^2(2a+1) = 64a^2.$\nStep 61:  Dividing both sides by $-4a^2$, we get $2a+1 = -16.$\nStep 62:  Solving for $a$, we have $a = -\\frac{15}{16}.$\nStep 63:  Since $a$ is a positive real number, this solution is not valid.\nStep 64:  Therefore, the only valid solution is $b=-2a$.\nStep",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the conditions given for the sequences $A_1$, $A_2$, $\\dots$, $A_n$.\nStep 2:  Each $A_i$ is a subset of the set $\\{1, 2, 3, \\dots, 10\\}$, and $A_{i-1}$ is a subset of $A_i$ for each $i$ between $2$ and $n$, inclusive.\nStep 3:  We are asked to find the number of such sequences, denoted as $K$, and then determine the remainder when $K$ is divided by $10$.\nStep 4:  To approach this problem, we can use a recursive method to count the number of valid sequences.\nStep 5:  We start by considering the first element of the sequence, which can be any subset of $\\{1, 2, 3, \\dots, 10\\}$. This gives us $2^{10}$ possibilities for the first element.\nStep 6:  For each of these possibilities, we then consider the second element of the sequence. The second element must be a subset of the first element, and there are $2^{10}$ possibilities for the second element as well.\nStep 7:  We continue this process, considering each subsequent element in the sequence and the number of possibilities for each.\nStep 8:  However, we need to be careful about overcounting, as the same sequence can be represented in multiple ways.\nStep 9:  To avoid overcounting, we can use a recursive approach to count the number of valid sequences.\nStep 10:  We define $f(n)$ as the number of valid sequences of length $n$.\nStep 11:  For each element $i$ in the set $\\{1, 2, 3, \\dots, 10\\}$, we can either include it in the sequence or not include it.\nStep 12:  If we include it, then we have $f(n-1)$ possibilities for the rest of the sequence. If we don't include it, then we have $f(n-1)$ possibilities for the rest of the sequence as well.\nStep 13:  Therefore, we have the recursive relation $f(n) = 2^{10} \\cdot f(n-1)$.\nStep 14:  We can solve this recursive relation to find the value of $f(n)$.\nStep 15:  After solving the recursive relation, we find that $f(n) = 2^{10n}$.\nStep 16:  To find the total number of valid sequences, we need to sum up the values of $f(n)$ for all possible values of $n$ from $1$ to $10$.\nStep 17:  This gives us the total number of valid sequences, denoted as $K$.\nStep 18:  Finally, we need to find the remainder when $K$ is divided by $10$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to consider the possible dates in the year 2023 and determine how many of them will have each digit appearing an even number of times in the 8-digit display.\nStep 2:  We start by considering the constraints for each digit in the 8-digit display. The year 2023 has a fixed 4-digit year, so we only need to focus on the 2-digit month and 2-digit date.\nStep 3:  We first consider the cases where the year 2023 is displayed as 2023yy, where yy represents the 2-digit month and date. In this case, the digits 2 and 3 will appear an odd number of times, so we can exclude this case.\nStep 4:  Next, we consider the case where the year 2023 is displayed as 20yy3, where yy represents the 2-digit month and date. Here, the digits 2 and 3 will appear an odd number of times, so we can exclude this case as well.\nStep 5:  Moving on, we consider the case where the year 2023 is displayed as 2yy03, where yy represents the 2-digit month and date. In this case, the digits 0 and 3 will appear an odd number of times, so we can exclude this case.\nStep 6:  Finally, we consider the case where the year 2023 is displayed as 2020yy, where yy represents the 2-digit month and date. Here, the digits 0 and 2 will appear an odd number of times, so we can exclude this case.\nStep 7:  After considering all the cases, we find that the only possible dates that satisfy the condition are those in the format 2020yy, where yy represents the 2-digit month and date.\nStep 8:  We then need to find the number of dates in the format 2020yy that satisfy the condition. We can do this by considering the possible values for the 2-digit month and date.\nStep 9:  The 2-digit month can be any value from 01 to 12, and the 2-digit date can be any value from 01 to 28 (since we're considering dates in the year 2023).\nStep 10:  However, we need to exclude the months with 31 days, as the date will exceed 28. This leaves us with the months of January, February, March, April, May, June, July, and August, which have 28 or 29 days.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the number of dates in the format 2020yy that satisfy the condition is the number of possible 2-digit months and dates, which is $4 \\cdot 4 = 16$.\nStep 12:  Hence, the final answer is $\\boxed{16}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{16}$",

Therefore, the total amount of juice in the first three glasses is $3x$.\nStep 4:  Since the fourth glass is only $\\frac{1}{3}$ full, the amount of juice in it is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\nStep 5:  To make all four glasses have the same amount of juice, we need to find the amount of juice that should be poured from each of the first three glasses into the fourth glass.\nStep 6:  This can be represented by the equation $3x - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{4}{3}x$, where $3x - \\frac{1}{3}$ represents the amount of juice in the first three glasses after pouring, and $\\frac{4}{3}x$ represents the amount of juice in the fourth glass after pouring.\nStep 7:  Solving for $x$, we get $3x - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{4}{3}x$, which simplifies to $\\frac{1}{3}x = \\frac{1}{3}$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, $x = 1$, which means each of the first three glasses has 1 unit of juice.\nStep 9:  To find the fraction of a glass that must be poured from each of the first three glasses into the fourth glass, we need to find the difference between the amount of juice in each of the first three glasses and the amount of juice in the fourth glass.\nStep 10:  This can be calculated as $\\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{4}{12} - \\frac{3}{12} = \\frac{1}{12}$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the fraction of a glass that must be poured from each of the first three glasses into the fourth glass is $\\frac{1}{12}$.\nStep 12:  The final answer is: $\\boxed{1+12=13}$",

This means the longer base has a length of $2x$.\nStep 3:  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the height of the trapezoid. The height can be calculated using the formula $\\sqrt{1^2 - \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^2}$, which simplifies to $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}x$.\nStep 4:  The area of a trapezoid is given by the formula $\\frac{1}{2}h(b_1 + b_2)$, where $h$ is the height and $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the lengths of the bases.\nStep 5:  Substituting the values we have, the area of the trapezoid is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}x \\cdot (x + 2x) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}x^2 + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}x$.\nStep 6:  To find the maximum area, we need to maximize the expression $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}x^2 + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}x$.\nStep 7:  We can do this by completing the square, which gives us $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}(x + 1)^2 - \\frac{1}{4}$.\nStep 8:  The maximum value of this expression occurs when $x = -1$, but since the length of the base cannot be negative, we need to find the maximum value of the expression when $x$ is positive.\nStep 9:  The maximum value of the expression occurs when $x = \\frac{1}{2}$, and the maximum area is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{16}$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the final answer is $m^2 + n^2 = \\left(\\frac{3}{16}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{16}{16}\\right)^2 = \\frac{9}{256} + \\frac{256}{256} = \\frac{265}{256}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{265}{256}}$",
