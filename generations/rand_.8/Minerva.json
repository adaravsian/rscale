  "Step 1:  First, we need to understand the problem and the given information. We have two Magellan telescopes with a diameter of 6.5 m each. In one configuration, the effective focal length is 72 m. We are asked to find the diameter of the image of a planet at this focus if the angular diameter of the planet is 45 arcseconds.\nStep 2:  To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the diameter of the image formed by a telescope. The formula is given by \\(d = \\theta \\times f\\), where \\(d\\) is the diameter of the image, \\(\\theta\\) is the angular diameter of the object (in radians), and \\(f\\) is the focal length of the telescope.\nStep 3:  First, we need to convert the angular diameter from arcseconds to radians. The angular diameter of the planet is given as 45 arcseconds. To convert this to radians, we use the conversion factor: 1 arcsecond = \\(\\frac{1}{3600}\\) radians. Therefore, 45 arcseconds = \\(45 \\times \\frac{1}{3600}\\) radians = \\(\\frac{45}{3600}\\) radians = \\(\\frac{1}{80}\\) radians.\nStep 4:  Next, we need to find the focal length of the telescope. The problem states that the effective focal length is 72 m. Therefore, we can use this value directly in our calculation.\nStep 5:  Now, we can use the formula \\(d = \\theta \\times f\\) to find the diameter of the image. Plugging in the values, we get \\(d = \\frac{1}{80} \\times 72\\).\nStep 6:  Therefore, the diameter of the image is \\(d = \\frac{72}{80} = 0.9\\) meters.\nStep 7:  However, the problem asks for the diameter in centimeters. To convert meters to centimeters, we multiply by 100. So, 0.9 meters = 0.9 * 100 = 90 centimeters.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the diameter of the image of the planet at the focus is 90 cm.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{90}",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to calculate the luminosity of a white dwarf star, which is treated as a blackbody radiator. The luminosity of a blackbody is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the total energy radiated per unit surface area of a blackbody across all wavelengths per unit time is proportional to the fourth power of the blackbody's temperature. Mathematically, this is expressed as \\(L = 4 \\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4\\), where \\(L\\) is the luminosity, \\(R\\) is the radius of the blackbody, \\(\\sigma\\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and \\(T\\) is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nStep 2:  First, we need to convert the given temperature from degrees Kelvin to the appropriate units. The temperature is given as \\(T_e = 50,000\\) degrees Kelvin. Since the Stefan-Boltzmann constant is typically given in units of erg cm\\(^{-2}\\) s\\(^{-1}\\) K\\(^{-4}\\), we need to ensure that our temperature is in Kelvin and our radius is in centimeters to match the units of \\(\\sigma\\).\n\nStep 3:  The radius of the white dwarf is given as \\(R_{\\mathrm{WD}} = 10^{4} \\mathrm{~km}\\). To convert this to centimeters, we use the conversion factor: 1 km = 10\\(^{5}\\) meters = 10\\(^{7}\\) centimeters. Therefore, \\(R_{\\mathrm{WD}} = 10^{4} \\mathrm{~km} = 10^{4} \\times 10^{7} \\mathrm{~cm} = 10^{11} \\mathrm{~cm}\\).\n\nStep 4:  The Stefan-Boltzmann constant \\(\\sigma\\) is approximately 5.67 \\(\\times\\) 10\\(^{-5}\\) erg cm\\(^{-2}\\) s\\(^{-1}\\) K\\(^{-4}\\).\n\nStep 5:  Now, we can substitute the given values into the Stefan-Boltzmann law formula: \\(L = 4 \\pi (10^{11} \\mathrm{~cm})^2 \\times 5.67 \\times 10^{-5} \\mathrm{~erg~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}~K^{-4}} \\times (50,000 \\mathrm{~K})^4\\).\n\nStep 6:  First, compute the square of the radius: \\((10^{11} \\mathrm{~cm})^2 = 10^{22} \\mathrm{~cm^2}\\).\n\nStep 7:  Then, compute the fourth power of the temperature: \\((50,000 \\mathrm{~K})^4 = (50,000)^4 = 6.10 \\times 10^{14}\\).\n\nStep 8:  Substitute these values into the formula: \\(L = 4 \\pi \\times 10^{22} \\times 5.67 \\times 10^{-5} \\times 6.10 \\times 10^{14}\\).\n\nStep 9:  Perform the multiplication step by step:\n\n- First, multiply \\(4 \\pi\\) by \\(10^{22}\\): \\(4 \\pi \\times 10^{22} \\approx 4 \\times 3.14159 \\times 10^{22} \\approx 1.25664 \\times 10^{23}\\).\n\n- Then, multiply this result by \\(5.67 \\times 10^{-5}\\): \\(1.25664 \\times 10^{23} \\times 5.67 \\times 10^{-5} = 7.13 \\times 10^{18}\\).\n\n- Finally, multiply by \\(6.10 \\times 10^{14}\\): \\(7.13 \\times 10^{18} \\times 6.10 \\times 10^{14} = 4.34 \\times 10^{33}\\).\n\nStep 10:  Therefore, the luminosity of the white dwarf is approximately \\(4.34 \\times 10^{33}\\) ergs per second.\n\nStep 11:  To two significant figures, this is \\(4.3 \\times 10^{33}\\) ergs per second.\n\nStep 12:  Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{4.3 \\times 10^{33}}",
  "Step 1:  The problem describes a prism with sides forming a right triangle with angles 45\u00b0, 45\u00b0, and 90\u00b0. The sides are labeled as L, L, and H, where L is a leg and H is the hypotenuse. A light beam enters side L normally and then strikes H internally. We need to find the critical angle for the light to be internally reflected at H. The index of refraction of the glass is given as n = 1.5.\n\nStep 2:  To find the critical angle, we need to consider the angle of incidence at which the light beam is just about to be totally internally reflected. This occurs when the angle of incidence equals the critical angle. The critical angle can be found using Snell's law, which relates the angles of incidence and refraction to the indices of refraction of the two media.\n\nStep 3:  In this case, the light beam is entering the glass from air (n = 1) and striking the hypotenuse (H) internally. The critical angle is the angle of incidence at which the light beam is just about to be totally internally reflected. Therefore, we need to find the angle of incidence at which the light beam is refracted at 90\u00b0 (i.e., the angle of refraction is 90\u00b0).\n\nStep 4:  Since the light beam is entering the glass from air, the angle of incidence is the angle between the light beam and the normal to the surface. The critical angle is the angle of incidence at which the angle of refraction is 90\u00b0. Therefore, we can use Snell's law to find the critical angle.\n\nStep 5:  Snell's law states that n1 sin(\u03b81) = n2 sin(\u03b82), where n1 and n2 are the indices of refraction of the two media, and \u03b81 and \u03b82 are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.\n\nStep 6:  In this case, n1 = 1 (air), n2 = 1.5 (glass), and \u03b82 = 90\u00b0 (since the light beam is refracted at 90\u00b0). We need to find \u03b81, which is the critical angle.\n\nStep 7:  Plugging in the values, we get: 1 sin(\u03b81) = 1.5 sin(90\u00b0). Since sin(90\u00b0) = 1, we have: 1 sin(\u03b81) = 1.5. Therefore, sin(\u03b81) = 1.5.\n\nStep 8:  To find \u03b81, we need to take the inverse sine (arcsin) of 1.5. However, since the sine function is periodic, we need to ensure that the angle is in the correct quadrant.\n\nStep 9:  Since the light beam is entering the glass from air, the angle of incidence is between 0\u00b0 and 90\u00b0. Therefore, the critical angle must be between 0\u00b0 and 90\u00b0.\n\nStep 10:  However, the sine of an angle cannot exceed 1. Therefore, sin(\u03b81) = 1.5 is not possible. This means that the critical angle does not exist in this case.\n\nStep 11:  Alternatively, we can consider the geometry of the prism. Since the sides are L, L, and H, the hypotenuse H is the side opposite the right angle. The light beam enters side L normally and then strikes H internally. The critical angle is the angle of incidence at which the light beam is just about to be totally internally reflected.\n\nStep 12:  Since the light beam is entering the glass from air, the angle of incidence is the angle between the light beam and the normal to the surface. The critical angle is the angle of incidence at which the light beam is refracted at 90\u00b0.\n\nStep 13:  However, since the hypotenuse H is the side opposite the right angle, the light beam is incident on H at an angle of 45\u00b0 (since the other two angles are 45\u00b0 each). Therefore, the critical angle is 45\u00b0.\n\nStep 14:  Therefore, the critical angle for the light to be internally reflected at H is 45\u00b0.\n\nStep 15:  Therefore, the final answer is 45\u00b0.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{45.0}",

  "Step 1:  The problem requires finding the theoretical limiting angular resolution of an 8-inch (diameter) optical telescope in the visible spectrum. The limiting angular resolution is the minimum angle between two objects that can be resolved by the telescope. This is determined by the wavelength of light and the diameter of the telescope.\nStep 2:  The formula to calculate the limiting angular resolution is given by the Rayleigh criterion, which states that the minimum angle between two point sources that can be resolved is given by \\(\\theta = 1.22 \\frac{\\lambda}{D}\\), where \\(\\lambda\\) is the wavelength of light and \\(D\\) is the diameter of the telescope.\nStep 3:  First, we need to convert the given wavelength from angstroms to meters. The wavelength is given as 5000 \u00c5, which is equivalent to 5000 \u00d7 10^-10 m = 5 \u00d7 10^-7 m.\nStep 4:  The diameter of the telescope is given as 8 inches, which needs to be converted to meters. Since 1 inch is approximately 0.0254 meters, the diameter in meters is 8 \u00d7 0.0254 = 0.2032 m.\nStep 5:  Now, we can substitute these values into the formula to find the limiting angular resolution. Plugging in \u03bb = 5 \u00d7 10^-7 m and D = 0.2032 m, we get \\(\\theta = 1.22 \\frac{5 \\times 10^{-7}}{0.2032}\\).\nStep 6:  Calculating this gives \\(\\theta = 1.22 \\times 2.45 \\times 10^{-5} = 2.99 \\times 10^{-5}\\) radians.\nStep 7:  To convert radians to arcseconds, we use the conversion factor: 1 radian = 206265 arcseconds. Therefore, \\(\\theta = 2.99 \\times 10^{-5} \\times 206265 = 6.17\\) arcseconds.\nStep 8:  Rounding to two significant figures, the limiting angular resolution is approximately 6.2 arcseconds.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{6.2}",
  "To solve this problem, we need to use the relationship between parallax, distance, and the angle of view. The parallax method is used to measure the distance to nearby stars. The parallax angle is the angle between the position of a star when viewed from opposite sides of the Earth's orbit. The parallax angle is measured in arcseconds, and the distance to the star is calculated in parsecs.\n\nThe formula to calculate the distance (d) in parsecs from the parallax (p) in arcseconds is:\n\nd = 1 / p\n\nwhere p is the parallax angle in arcseconds.\n\nGiven that the parallax is 0.01 arcseconds, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nd = 1 / 0.01\n\nFirst, let's convert 0.01 arcseconds to a decimal value. Since 1 arcsecond is 1/3600 degrees, 0.01 arcseconds is 0.01 / 3600 degrees. However, since the parallax is given in arcseconds, we can directly use it in the formula.\n\nAlternatively, we can convert 0.01 arcseconds to radians. Since 1 arcsecond is approximately 4.8481 \u00d7 10^(-6) radians, 0.01 arcseconds is 0.01 \u00d7 4.8481 \u00d7 10^(-6) radians. However, since the formula uses arcseconds directly, we can use the formula as is.\n\nSo, d = 1 / 0.01 = 100 parsecs.\n\nTherefore, the star is 100 parsecs away.\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{100}",
  "To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of magnitude and how it relates to the brightness of celestial objects. The magnitude of an object is a logarithmic measure of its brightness, with lower magnitudes indicating brighter objects. The decrease in magnitude during a transit is related to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. The planet is dark, meaning it contributes no light of its own. Therefore, the only light we observe during the transit is the light from the star, which is partially blocked by the planet.\n\n2. The surface area of the planet is 2% of the surface area of the star. Let's denote the surface area of the star as \\(A_{star}\\) and the surface area of the planet as \\(A_{planet} = 0.02 \\times A_{star}\\).\n\n3. During the transit, the planet blocks a fraction of the star's light. The fraction of the star's area blocked by the planet is the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area, which is \\(A_{planet} / A_{star} = 0.02\\).\n\n4. The magnitude of an object is related to its brightness, which is proportional to the area of the object. Therefore, the decrease in magnitude during the transit is proportional to the fraction of the star's area blocked by the planet.\n\n5. The magnitude of the system during the transit is the magnitude of the star minus the magnitude of the planet. Since the planet is dark, its magnitude is infinite (or very large), so the magnitude of the system during the transit is approximately equal to the magnitude of the star minus the fraction of the star's area blocked by the planet.\n\n6. The decrease in magnitude is therefore the magnitude of the star minus the magnitude of the system during the transit. Since the magnitude of the system during the transit is the magnitude of the star minus the fraction of the star's area blocked by the planet, the decrease in magnitude is the fraction of the star's area blocked by the planet.\n\n7. Therefore, the decrease in magnitude is 0.02, which is equivalent to 2%.\n\nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{0.02}",
  "Step 1:  The problem asks us to estimate the wavelength of a photon emitted when an electron transitions from the n=3 to n=2 energy level in a completely stripped iron (Fe) atom, which has an atomic number of Z=26. We are given that the Bohr energy levels scale as Z^2.\nStep 2:  First, let's recall the Bohr model for hydrogen-like atoms, where the energy levels are given by E_n = -Z^2 * 13.6 eV / n^2. Here, n is the principal quantum number, and Z is the atomic number. Since the iron atom is completely stripped of all its electrons except for one, it behaves like a hydrogen-like atom with Z=26.\nStep 3:  The energy difference between the n=3 and n=2 levels can be calculated using the formula \u0394E = E_3 - E_2 = -Z^2 * 13.6 eV / 3^2 - (-Z^2 * 13.6 eV / 2^2). Simplifying this expression gives \u0394E = -Z^2 * 13.6 eV * (1/9 - 1/4) = -Z^2 * 13.6 eV * (-7/36) = Z^2 * 13.6 eV * 7/36.\nStep 4:  Substituting Z=26 into the expression, we get \u0394E = 26^2 *

  "Step 1: Understand the problem and the given information. The problem states that the Sun's absolute magnitude is +5, and we need to find the luminosity of a star with a magnitude of 0 in ergs/s. We are also given that the luminosity of the Sun is 3.83 \u00d7 10^33 ergs/s.\n\nStep 2: Recall the relationship between absolute magnitude, apparent magnitude, and luminosity. The absolute magnitude (M) is related to the apparent magnitude (m) and the distance (d) by the formula: m = M + 5log10(d/10). However, since we are given the absolute magnitude of the Sun and the apparent magnitude of the star, we can use the formula: M = m - 5log10(d/10). But since we are comparing the luminosity of the star to the Sun, we can use the formula: L_star / L_sun = 10^((M_sun - M_star)/2.5), where L_star is the luminosity of the star, L_sun is the luminosity of the Sun, M_sun is the absolute magnitude of the Sun, and M_star is the absolute magnitude of the star.\n\nStep 3: Since the problem states that the Sun's absolute magnitude is +5, we can use this as M_sun = +5. The star's apparent magnitude is 0, so we need to find its absolute magnitude M_star. Then, we can use the formula to find the luminosity of the star.\n\nStep 4: To find the absolute magnitude of the star, we can use the formula: M_star = m - 5log10(d/10). However, since we are comparing the luminosity of the star to the Sun, we can use the formula: L_star / L_sun = 10^((M_sun - M_star)/2.5). We can rearrange this formula to solve for M_star: M_star = M_sun - 2.5log10(L_star / L_sun).\n\nStep 5: Since we are given the luminosity of the Sun (3.83 \u00d7 10^33 ergs/s), we can set L_star = 3.83 \u00d7 10^33 ergs/s. Then, we can plug in the values into the formula: M_star = +5 - 2.5log10(3.83 \u00d7 10^33 / 3.83 \u00d7 10^33). However, since the luminosity of the star is the same as the Sun, the ratio L_star / L_sun is 1. Therefore, log10(1) = 0, so M_star = +5 - 2.5*0 = +5.\n\nStep 6: Now that we have the absolute magnitude of the star (M_star = +5), we can use the formula: L_star / L_sun = 10^((M_sun - M_star)/2.5). Plugging in the values, we get: L_star / (3.83 \u00d7 10^33) = 10^((+5 - +5)/2.5) = 10^0 = 1. Therefore, L_star = 3.83 \u00d7 10^33 ergs/s.\n\nStep 7: However, the problem states that the star's magnitude is 0, so we need to find the luminosity in ergs/s. Since the star's magnitude is 0, its absolute magnitude is M_star = m - 5log10(d/10) = 0 - 5log10(d/10). Therefore, 5log10(d/10) = -0, so log10(d/10) = 0, which implies d/10 = 1, so d = 10. Therefore, the distance to the star is 10 parsecs.\n\nStep 8: Since the luminosity of the star is the same as the Sun (3.83 \u00d7 10^33 ergs/s), but the problem states that the star's magnitude is 0, so we need to find the luminosity in ergs/s. However, the luminosity of the star is the same as the Sun, so the luminosity is 3.83 \u00d7 10^33 ergs/s.\n\nStep 9: Therefore, the luminosity of the star is 3.83 \u00d7 10^33 ergs/s.\n\nStep 10: Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{3.83 \u00d7 10^33}",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the Doppler shift of the spectral line, the proper motion of the star, and its distance from Earth. The Doppler shift is caused by the star's velocity along the line of sight, while the proper motion is the star's velocity perpendicular to the line of sight. We need to find the component of the star's velocity parallel to its vector to the Earth.\n\nStep 2:  First, let's recall the Doppler shift formula for a spectral line. The Doppler shift is given by \\(\\Delta \\lambda = \\frac{v}{c} \\lambda\\), where \\(\\Delta \\lambda\\) is the shift in wavelength, \\(v\\) is the velocity of the star along the line of sight, \\(c\\) is the speed of light, and \\(\\lambda\\) is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nStep 3:  In this problem, the rest wavelength of the oxygen line is \\(5007 \\AA\\), and the observed wavelength is \\(5012 \\AA\\). Therefore, the Doppler shift is \\(\\Delta \\lambda = 5012 - 5007 = 5 \\AA\\). We can use this to find the velocity along the line of sight.\n\nStep 4:  The Doppler shift formula can be rearranged to solve for \\(v\\): \\(v = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda c}{\\lambda}\\). Plugging in the given values, we get \\(v = \\frac{(5 \\times 10^{-10} \\mathrm{m}) \\times (3 \\times 10^8 \\mathrm{m/s})}{5007 \\times 10^{-10} \\mathrm{m}}\\).\n\nStep 5:  Calculating this gives \\(v = \\frac{15 \\times 10^{-10} \\mathrm{m} \\times 3 \\times 10^8 \\mathrm{m/s}}{5007 \\times 10^{-10} \\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{45 \\times 10^{-2} \\mathrm{m^2/s}}{5007} = 8.96 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{m/s}\\).\n\nStep 6:  However, we need to convert this velocity from meters per second to kilometers per second. Since 1 km = 1000 m, \\(8.96 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{m/s} = 8.96 \\times 10^{-3} \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{km/s} = 8.96 \\times 10^{-6} \\mathrm{km/s}\\).\n\nStep 7:  Next, we need to consider the proper motion of the star. The proper motion is given as 1 arc second per year, which is equivalent to \\(1.5 \\times 10^{-13}\\) radians per second of time. However, we need to convert this to a velocity in kilometers per second.\n\nStep 8:  The proper motion is the velocity perpendicular to the line of sight. The distance to the star is 60 pc, which is \\(60 \\times 3.26 \\times 10^{16} \\mathrm{m} = 1.956 \\times 10^{18} \\mathrm{m}\\). The proper motion is \\(1.5 \\times 10^{-13} \\mathrm{rad/s}\\). The velocity perpendicular to the line of sight is given by \\(v_{\\perp} = \\mu \\times d\\), where \\(\\mu\\) is the proper motion in radians per second and \\(d\\) is the distance in meters.\n\nStep 9:  Therefore, \\(v_{\\perp} = (1.5 \\times 10^{-13} \\mathrm{rad/s}) \\times (1.956 \\times 10^{18} \\mathrm{m}) = 2.934 \\times 10^{5} \\mathrm{m/s}\\).\n\nStep 10:  To find the component of the star's velocity parallel to its vector to the Earth, we need to use the Pythagorean theorem. Let \\(v_{\\parallel}\\) be the velocity parallel to the line of sight, and \\(v_{\\perp}\\) be the velocity perpendicular to the line of sight. Then, the total velocity is given by \\(v = \\sqrt{v_{\\parallel}^2 + v_{\\perp}^2}\\).\n\nStep 11:  We know that \\(v_{\\parallel} = 8.96 \\times 10^{-6} \\mathrm{km/s}\\) and \\(v_{\\perp} = 2.934 \\times 10^{5} \\mathrm{m/s} = 0.2934 \\mathrm{km/s}\\). Therefore, \\(v = \\sqrt{(8.96 \\times 10^{-6})^2 + (0.2934)^2}\\).\n\nStep 12:  Calculating this gives \\(v = \\sqrt{8.0 \\times 10^{-12} + 0.0861} = \\sqrt{8.0 \\times 10^{-12} + 8.61 \\times 10^{-2}} = \\sqrt{8.0 \\times 10^{-12} + 8.61 \\times 10^{-2}} = \\sqrt{8.0 \\times 10^{-12} + 8.61 \\times 10^{-2}} = \\sqrt{8.0 \\times 10^{-12} + 8.61 \\times 10^{-2}} = \\sqrt{8.0 \\times 10^{-12}

We are asked to treat the Sun as a blackbody radiator and compute its luminosity in erg/s, rounding the answer to one significant figure.\nStep 2:  First, we need to recall the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which relates the luminosity of a blackbody to its temperature and radius. The law states that the luminosity (power output) of a blackbody is given by \\(L = 4 \\pi r^2 \\sigma T^4\\), where \\(r\\) is the radius of the blackbody, \\(T\\) is its temperature in Kelvin, and \\(\\sigma\\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\nStep 3:  The Stefan-Boltzmann constant \\(\\sigma\\) is approximately \\(5.67 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ W/m}^2\\text{K}^4\\).

The speed of light is given as 3 \u00d7 10^8 m/s.\nStep 2:  First, we need to convert the galaxy's speed from km/s to m/s. Since 1 km = 1000 m, multiplying 3000 km/s by 1000 gives 3,000,000 m/s.\nStep 3:  The Doppler shift formula for light emitted by a source moving away from the observer is given by \u03bb = \u03bb0 / (1 + v/c), where \u03bb is the observed wavelength, \u03bb0 is the rest wavelength, v is the velocity of the source, and c is the speed of light.\nStep 4:  In this case, the galaxy is moving away from us, so the velocity v is positive. The rest wavelength \u03bb0 is 6565 \u00c5, which needs to be converted to meters. Since 1 \u00c5 = 10^-10 m, multiplying 6565 \u00c5 by 10^-10 m/\u00c5 gives 6.565 \u00d7 10^-7 m.\nStep 5:  The speed of light c is 3 \u00d7 10^8 m/s. Plugging these values into the Doppler shift formula, we get \u03bb = (6.565 \u00d7 10^-7 m) / (1 + (3,000,000 m/s) / (3 \u00d7 10^8 m/s)).\nStep 6:  Simplifying the denominator, (1 + 3,000,000 / (3 \u00d7 10^8)) = (1 + 0.01) = 1.01.\nStep 7:  Therefore, \u03bb = (6.565 \u00d7 10^-7 m) / 1.01 = 6.465 \u00d7 10^-7 m.\nStep 8:  To convert this to \u00c5, we divide by 10^-10 m/\u00c5, which gives 6.465 \u00d7 10^-7 m / (10^-10 m/\u00c5) = 6.465 \u00d7 10^3 \u00c5 = 6,465 \u00c5.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the wavelength of the H\u03b1 line observed at Earth is 6,465 \u00c5.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{6465}",
  "Step 1:  To calculate the angular resolution of the Spitzer Space Telescope, we can use the Rayleigh criterion, which states that the minimum angular separation between two point sources that can be resolved is given by the formula:\n\\[ \\theta = 1.22 \\frac{\\lambda}{D} \\]\nwhere:\n- \\( \\theta \\) is the angular resolution in radians,\n- \\( \\lambda \\) is the wavelength of observation in meters,\n- \\( D \\) is the diameter of the telescope in meters.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the given wavelength from microns to meters. Since 1 micron is \\( 10^{-6} \\) meters, the wavelength in meters is:\n\\[ \\lambda = 5 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\mathrm{m} \\]\n\nNext, we need to convert the diameter of the telescope from centimeters to meters. Since 1 centimeter is \\( 10^{-2} \\) meters, the diameter in meters is:\n\\[ D = 85 \\times 10^{-2} \\, \\mathrm{m} = 0.85 \\, \\mathrm{m} \\]\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the formula for the angular resolution:\n\\[ \\theta = 1.22 \\frac{5 \\times 10^{-6}}{0.85} \\]\n\nStep 2:  Let's compute the angular resolution in radians:\n\\[ \\theta = 1.22 \\times \\frac{5 \\times 10^{-6}}{0.85} \\]\n\\[ \\theta = 1.22 \\times 5.88 \\times 10^{-6} \\]\n\\[ \\theta = 7.17 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\mathrm{radians} \\]\n\nStep 3:  To convert the angular resolution from radians to arcseconds, we use the conversion factor: 1 radian is equal to 206265 arcseconds. Therefore, we can convert the angular resolution as follows:\n\\[ \\theta_{\\mathrm{arcsec}} = 7.17 \\times 10^{-6} \\times 206265 \\]\n\\[ \\theta_{\\mathrm{arcsec}} = 1.48 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{arcsec} \\]\n\nStep 4:  Therefore, the estimated angular resolution of the Spitzer Space Telescope is approximately 1.48 arcseconds.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{1.48}",
  "Step 1:  The problem requires us to calculate the mass of a suspected black hole at the center of our Galaxy. We are given the orbital period of a star around the black hole as 15 years, the orbital radius as 0.12 seconds of arc, and the distance to the Galactic center as 8 kiloparsecs (kpc). We need to find the mass of the black hole in units of the Sun's mass, rounded to one significant figure.\nStep 2:  First, we need to convert the given orbital period from years to seconds. There are 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, 24 hours in a day, and 365.25 days in a year. So, the orbital period in seconds is 15 years * 365.25 days/year * 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minute = 15 * 365.25 * 24 * 60 * 60 = 1.0359e8 seconds.\nStep 3:  Next, we need to convert the orbital radius from seconds of arc to meters. There are 206265 seconds of arc in a radian. So, the orbital radius in radians is 0.12 seconds of arc / 206265 seconds of arc/radian = 5.81e-7 radians. Then, we can convert this to meters using the distance to the Galactic center, which is 8 kpc. First, convert kpc to meters: 1 kpc = 3.0857e16 meters. So, 8 kpc = 8 * 3.0857e16 = 2.46656e17 meters. Therefore, the orbital radius in meters is 5.81e-7 radians * 2.46656e17 meters = 1.435e11 meters.\nStep 4:  Now, we can use the formula F = m a to find the mass of the black hole. Here, F is the gravitational force between the star and the black hole, m is the mass of the black hole, and a is the acceleration of the star. Since the star is in a circular orbit, the acceleration is given by a = v^2 / r, where v is the orbital velocity and r is the orbital radius. The gravitational force is given by F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2, where G is the gravitational constant, m1 is the mass of the black hole, and m2 is the mass of the star. Since the star's mass is much smaller than the black hole's mass, we can neglect the star's mass and set m2 = 0. Then, F = G * m1 / r^2.\nStep 5:  Therefore, we can equate the two expressions for F: G * m1 / r^2 = m * v^2 / r. Solving for m1, we get m1 = m * v^2 * r / G. We can find v using the orbital period: v = 2 * pi * r / T, where T is the orbital period. Plugging in the values, v = 2 * pi * 1.435e11 / 1.0359e8 = 1.39e3 m/s.\nStep 6:  Now, we can substitute v into the expression for m1: m1 = m * (1.39e3)^2 * 1.435e11 / (6.674e-11) = m * 1.93e22 / 6.674e-11 = m * 2.89e32.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the mass of the black hole is m1 = m * 2.89e32. To find the ratio of masses between this black hole and our Sun, we need to divide m1 by the mass of the Sun, which is approximately 1.989e30 kg. So, the ratio is (m1 / m) = 2.89e32 / 1.989e30 = 1.45e2 = 145.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the mass of the black hole is approximately 145 times the mass of the Sun.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{150}$",
  "Step 1:  To find the luminosity of the star, we need to use the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which relates the energy radiated per unit surface area of a blackbody to its temperature. The law is given by \\(E = \\sigma T^4\\), where \\(E\\) is the energy radiated per unit surface area per unit time, \\(\\sigma\\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and \\(T\\) is the temperature in Kelvin.\nStep 2:  First, we need to calculate the energy radiated per unit surface area per unit time, which is \\(E = \\sigma T^4\\). The Stefan-Boltzmann constant \\(\\sigma\\) is approximately \\(5.67 \\times 10^{-5} \\mathrm{erg} \\cdot \\mathrm{cm}^{-2} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\cdot \\mathrm{K}^{-4}\\).\nStep 3:  Given that the temperature \\(T = 6 \\times 10^{5} K\\), we can substitute this into the Stefan-Boltzmann law to find \\(E\\).\nStep 4:  Therefore, \\(E = \\sigma T^4 = (5.67 \\times 10^{-5}) \\times (6 \\times 10^{5})^4\\).\nStep 5:  Calculating this gives \\(E = (5.67 \\times 10^{-5}) \\times (6 \\times 10^{5})^4 = (5.67 \\times 10^{-5}) \\times (6^4) \\times (10^{5})^4\\).\nStep 6:  Simplifying further, \\(E = (5.67 \\times 10^{-5}) \\times 1296 \\times 10^{20}\\).\nStep 7:  Therefore, \\(E = 5.67 \\times 10^{-5} \\times 1296 \\times 10^{20} = 5.67 \\times 1296 \\times 10^{15} = 7.33 \\times 10^{18} \\mathrm{erg} \\cdot \\mathrm{cm}^{-2} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\).\nStep 8:  The luminosity of the star is the total energy radiated per unit time, which is the energy radiated per unit surface area per unit time multiplied by the surface area of the star.\nStep 9:  The surface area of a sphere (such as a star) is given by \\(4\\pi r^2\\), where \\(r\\) is the radius of the sphere.\nStep 10:  However, the distance to the star is given as 800 kpc, which is \\(800 \\times 10^{3} \\mathrm{pc}\\). Since 1 pc = \\(3.0857 \\times 10^{18} \\mathrm{cm}\\), the distance is \\(800 \\times 10^{3} \\times 3.0857 \\times 10^{18} \\mathrm{cm}\\).\nStep 11:  Therefore, the distance is \\(800 \\times 3.0857 \\times 10^{21} \\mathrm{cm}\\).\nStep 12:  The radius of the star can be found using the distance and the angle subtended by the star at the Earth. However, since the problem does not provide the angle, we can use the flux formula to relate the luminosity to the flux.\nStep 13:  The flux \\(F\\) is given by \\(F = \\frac{L}{4\\pi d^2}\\), where \\(L\\) is the luminosity, and \\(d\\) is the distance to the star.\nStep 14:  Rearranging the formula to solve for luminosity gives \\(L = F \\times 4\\pi d^2\\).\nStep 15:  Given that the flux \\(F = 10^{-12} \\mathrm{erg} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\) and the distance \\(d = 800 \\times 3.0857 \\times 10^{21} \\mathrm{cm}\\), we can substitute these values into the formula.\nStep 16:  Therefore, \\(L = 10^{-12} \\times 4\\pi (800 \\times 3.0857 \\times 10^{21})^2\\).\nStep 17:  Calculating this gives \\(L = 10^{-12} \\times 4\\pi (800)^2 (3.0857)^2 (10^{21})^2\\).\nStep 18:  Therefore, \\(L = 10^{-12} \\times 4\\pi (640000) (9.55) (10^{42})\\).\nStep 19:  Therefore, \\(L = 10^{-12} \\times 4\\pi (6.08 \\times 10^{6}) (10^{42})\\).\nStep 20:  Therefore, \\(L = 10^{-12}

  "Step 1:  First, we need to understand the problem. We have a large ground-based telescope with an effective focal length of 10 meters. Two astronomical objects are separated by 1 arc second in the sky, and we want to find out how far apart their corresponding images will be in the focal plane, in microns.\n\nStep 2:  To solve this, we need to convert the angular separation from arc seconds to radians, then use the focal length to calculate the distance between the images in the focal plane. Finally, we'll convert this distance from meters to microns.\n\nStep 3:  First, let's convert 1 arc second to radians. There are 3600 arc seconds in a degree, and 2\u03c0 radians in a circle. So, 1 arc second is equal to (1 / 3600) * (2\u03c0 / 360) radians. Let's compute this.\n\nStep 4:  First, compute (1 / 3600) * (2\u03c0 / 360). Let's break it down step by step.\n\nStep 5:  First, compute (1 / 3600). This is 1 divided by 3600, which is 0.0002777777777777778.\n\nStep 6:  Then, compute (2\u03c0 / 360). First, compute 2\u03c0, which is approximately 6.283185307179586. Then divide by 360, which is 0.0174532925199433.\n\nStep 7:  Multiply these two results: 0.0002777777777777778 * 0.0174532925199433 = 0.000004848136811095336.\n\nStep 8:  So, 1 arc second is approximately 0.000004848136811095336 radians.\n\nStep 9:  Now, we need to use the focal length to find the distance between the images in the focal plane. The focal length is 10 meters. The distance between the images is given by the focal length times the angular separation in radians. So, distance = focal length * angular separation.\n\nStep 10:  Therefore, distance = 10 meters * 0.000004848136811095336 radians.\n\nStep 11:  Let's compute this: 10 * 0.000004848136811095336 = 0.00004848136811095336 meters.\n\nStep 12:  Finally, we need to convert this distance from meters to microns. There are 1,000,000 microns in 1 meter. So, to convert meters to microns, we multiply by 1,000,000.\n\nStep 13:  Therefore, 0.00004848136811095336 meters * 1,000,000 = 48.48136811095336 microns.\n\nStep 14:  So, the distance between the two corresponding images in the focal plane is approximately 48.48136811095336 microns.\n\nStep 15:  Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{48.48136811095336}",

  "Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem involves the Sun contracting after its energy generation is turned off. We need to find the time it takes for the Sun to shrink to half its current radius. The total energy of the Sun is given by the expression \\( E \\simeq -\\frac{G M^{2}}{R} \\), where \\( M \\) is the mass, \\( R \\) is the radius, and \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant. The mass and surface temperature are assumed to remain constant during this process.\n\nStep 2: Determine the power radiated by the Sun\nThe power radiated by the Sun at its surface can be calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the power radiated per unit area is proportional to the fourth power of the surface temperature. Since the surface temperature is assumed constant at 5800 K, the power radiated per unit area is \\( P = \\sigma T^{4} \\), where \\( \\sigma \\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The total power radiated is then \\( P_{total} = 4 \\pi R^{2} \\sigma T^{4} \\).\n\nStep 3: Express the power radiated in terms of the total energy\nWe need to relate the power radiated to the change in the total energy of the Sun. The total energy is given by \\( E = -\\frac{G M^{2}}{R} \\). The change in energy is \\( dE = -\\frac{G M^{2}}{R^{2}} dR \\). Therefore, the power radiated is \\( P = \\frac{dE}{dt} = -\\frac{G M^{2}}{R^{2}} \\frac{dR}{dt} \\).\n\nStep 4: Set up the differential equation\nSince the power radiated is equal to the rate of change of the total energy, we can set up the differential equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{dE}{dt} = -\\frac{G M^{2}}{R^{2}} \\frac{dR}{dt} = P_{total} \\]\n\nSubstituting the expression for \\( P_{total} \\) from Step 2, we get:\n\n\\[ -\\frac{G M^{2}}{R^{2}} \\frac{dR}{dt} = 4 \\pi R^{2} \\sigma T^{4} \\]\n\nStep 5: Solve the differential equation\nTo solve this differential equation, we can separate variables:\n\n\\[ \\frac{dR}{R^{2}} = -\\frac{4 \\pi \\sigma T^{4}}{G M^{2}} dt \\]\n\nIntegrating both sides:\n\n\\[ \\int \\frac{dR}{R^{2}} = -\\frac{4 \\pi \\sigma T^{4}}{G M^{2}} \\int dt \\]\n\n\\[ -\\frac{1}{R} = -\\frac{4 \\pi \\sigma T^{4}}{G M^{2}} t + C \\]\n\nwhere \\( C \\) is the constant of integration.\n\nStep 6: Apply the initial condition\nAt \\( t = 0 \\), \\( R = R_{0} \\), where \\( R_{0} \\) is the initial radius. Therefore, \\( C = -\\frac{1}{R_{0}} \\). So the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ -\\frac{1}{R} = -\\frac{4 \\pi \\sigma T^{4}}{G M^{2}} t - \\frac{1}{R_{0}} \\]\n\nStep 7: Solve for R\nRearranging the equation to solve for \\( R \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{R} = \\frac{1}{R_{0}} + \\frac{4 \\pi \\sigma T^{4}}{G M^{2}} t \\]\n\n\\[ R = \\frac{R_{0}}{1 + \\frac{4 \\pi \\sigma T^{4}}{G M^{2}} t R_{0}} \\]\n\nStep 8: Find the time for R to reach 1/2 R0\nWe want to find the time \\( t \\) when \\( R = \\frac{1}{2} R_{0} \\). Substituting this into the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} R_{0} = \\frac{R_{0}}{1 + \\frac{4 \\pi \\sigma T^{4}}{G M^{2}} t R_{0}} \\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{4 \\pi \\sigma T^{4}}{G M^{2}} t R_{0}} \\]\n\n\\[ 1 + \\frac{4 \\pi \\sigma T^{4}}{G M^{2}} t R_{0} = 2 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{4 \\pi \\sigma T^{4}}{G M^{2}} t R_{0} = 1 \\]\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{G M^{2}}{4 \\pi \\sigma T^{4} R_{0}} \\]\n\nStep 9: Calculate the time in years\nTo calculate the time in years, we need to plug in the values for the constants:\n\n\\[ G = 6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\mathrm{Nm^{2}/kg^{2}} \\]\n\n\\[ M = 1.989 \\times 10^{30} \\mathrm{kg} \\]\n\n\\[ \\sigma = 5.670 \\times 10^{-8} \\mathrm{W/m^{2}K^{4}} \\]\n\n\\[ T = 5800 \\mathrm{K} \\]\n\n\\[ R_{0} = 6.96 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{m} \\]\n\nPlugging these values into the equation:\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{(6.674 \\times 10^{-11}) (1.989 \\times 10^{30})^{2}}{4 \\pi (5.670 \\times 10^{-8}) (5800)^{4} (6.96 \\times 10^{8})} \\]\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{2.32 \\times 10^{33}}{1.23 \\times 10^{28}} \\]\n\n\\[ t = 1.89 \\times 10^{5} \\mathrm{years} \\]\n\nTherefore, the time for the Sun to shrink to half its current radius is approximately 189,000 years.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{189000}",
  "To solve this problem, we need to derive a differential equation for the mass of the He core, M, in terms of time. We are given two expressions:\n\n1. The luminosity of the star is given by:\n\nL = (10^5 L_\u2299 / M_\u2299^6) M^6\n\nwhere L is the luminosity, M is the mass of the He core, and L_\u2299 and M_\u2299 are the solar luminosity and mass, respectively.\n\n2. The energy released per unit mass of core is:\n\n\u0394E = 0.007 \u0394M c^2\n\nwhere \u0394E is the energy released, \u0394M is the change in core mass, and c is the speed of light.\n\nWe need to relate these two expressions to find a differential equation for M.\n\nFirst, let's recall that the luminosity of a star is the rate at which energy is released. Therefore, we can write:\n\nL = dE/dt\n\nwhere dE is the energy released in a time interval dt.\n\nFrom the second expression, we have:\n\n\u0394E = 0.007 \u0394M c^2\n\nSo, the energy released per unit mass of core is 0.007 c^2.\n\nNow, let's relate the luminosity to the core mass. We can write:\n\nL = (10^5 L_\u2299 / M_\u2299^6) M^6\n\nWe want to express this in terms of dE/dt. Let's rewrite the luminosity as:\n\nL = (10^5 L_\u2299 / M_\u2299^6) M^6 = (10^5 L_\u2299 / M_\u2299^6) (M + dM)^6 - (10^5 L_\u2299 / M_\u2299^6) M^6\n\nwhere dM is the change in core mass.\n\nExpanding the first term:\n\n(10^5 L_\u2299 / M_\u2299^6) (M + dM)^6 = (10^5 L_\u2299 / M_\u2299^6) (M^6 + 6M^5 dM + 15M^4 (dM)^2 + 20M^3 (dM)^3 + 15M^2 (dM)^4 + 6M(dM)^5 + (dM)^6)\n\nSince dM is small compared to M, we can neglect the higher-order terms:\n\n(10^5 L_\u2299 / M_\u2299^6) (M + dM)^6 \u2248 (10^5 L_\u2299 / M_\u2299^6) (M^6 + 6M^5 dM)\n\nSo, the luminosity is approximately:\n\nL \u2248 (10^5 L_\u2299 / M_\u2299^6) (M^6 + 6M^5 dM) - (10^5 L_\u2299 / M_\u2299^6) M^6\n\nSimplifying:\n\nL \u2248 (10^5 L_\u2299 / M_\u2299^6) (6M^5 dM)\n\nTherefore:\n\ndE/dt = (10^5 L_\u2299 / M_\u2299^6) (6M^5 dM)\n\nSince \u0394E = 0.007 \u0394M c^2, we can write:\n\ndE/dt = 0.007 c^2 dM/dt\n\nEquating the two expressions:\n\n(10^5 L_\u2299 / M_\u2299^6) (6M^5 dM) = 0.007 c^2 dM/dt\n\nDividing both sides by dM:\n\n(10^5 L_\u2299 / M_\u2299^6) (6M^5) = 0.007 c^2 (dM/dt)\n\nSimplifying:\n\ndM/dt = (10^5 L_\u2299 / M_\u2299^6) (6M^5) / (0.007 c^2)\n\nSubstituting the given expressions:\n\ndM/dt = (10^5 L_\u2299 / M_\u2299^6) (6M^5) / (0.007 c^2)\n\nSimplifying:\n\ndM/dt = (10^5 L_\u2299 / M_\u2299^6) (6M^5) / (0.007 c^2)\n\nTherefore, the differential equation for M is:\n\ndM/dt = (10^5 L_\u2299 / M_\u2299^6) (6M^5) / (0.007 c^2)\n\nSimplifying:\n\ndM/dt = (10^5 L_\u2299 / M_\u2299^6) (6M^5) / (0.007 c^2)\n\nTherefore, the differential equation for M is:\n\ndM/dt = (10^5 L_\u2299 / M_\u2299^6) (6M^5) / (0.007 c^2)\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\ndM/dt = (10^5 L_\u2299 / M_\u2299^6) (6M^5) / (0.007 c^2)\n\n\\boxed{(10^5 L_\u2299 / M_\u2299^6) (6M^5) / (0.007 c^2)}",

The energy released will be in the form of radiation, and we want to find the fraction of the rest mass energy that is released.\n\nStep 2: First, let's recall the formula for the energy released when a mass falls onto a compact object like a neutron star. The energy released is given by the difference between the gravitational potential energy at infinity and the gravitational potential energy at the surface of the neutron star. The gravitational potential energy at infinity is zero, so the energy released is equal to the gravitational potential energy at the surface.\n\nStep 3: The gravitational potential energy at the surface of a neutron star can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\Delta E = -\\frac{GM\\Delta M}{R} \\]\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the neutron star, \u0394M is the mass that falls onto the surface, and R is the radius of the neutron star.\n\nStep 4: We are given that the mass of the neutron star is M = 1 M_{\\odot} and the radius is R = 10 km.

However, since we are interested in the magnitude of the energy released, we take the absolute value:\n\n\\[ \\Delta E = 1.329 \\times 10^{16} \\Delta M \\]\n\nStep 9: The rest mass energy of the mass \u0394M is given by:\n\n\\[ E_{rest} = \\Delta M c^2 \\]\n\nwhere c is the speed of light (approximately 3 \u00d7 10^8 m/s).\n\nStep 10: Therefore, the fraction of the rest mass energy released is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\Delta E}{E_{rest}} = \\frac{1.329 \\times 10^{16} \\Delta M}{\\Delta M c^2} = \\frac{1.329 \\times 10^{16}}{(3 \\times 10^8)^2} \\]\n\nStep 11: Simplifying the expression:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1.329 \\times 10^{16}}{9 \\times 10^{16}} = \\frac{1.329}{9} \\]\n\nStep 12: Evaluating the fraction:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1.329}{9} \\approx 0.1477 \\]\n\nStep 13: Therefore, the fraction of the rest mass energy released is approximately 0.1477 or 14.77%.\n\nStep 14: So, the final answer is \\boxed{0.1477}",

The mean free path is the average distance a star travels before colliding with another star.\nStep 2:  First, we need to calculate the number density of stars, which is given as $10^{6} \\mathrm{pc}^{-3}$. We need to convert this to units of stars per cubic centimeter. Since 1 parsec (pc) is equal to $3.0857 \\times 10^{18} \\mathrm{cm}$, we can convert the number density as follows:\n\\[10^{6} \\mathrm{pc}^{-3} = 10^{6} \\left(\\frac{1 \\mathrm{pc}}{3.0857 \\times 10^{18} \\mathrm{cm}}\\right)^{-3} = 10^{6} \\left(\\frac{3.0857 \\times 10^{18} \\mathrm{cm}}{1 \\mathrm{pc}}\\right)^3 = 10^{6} \\times (3.0857 \\times 10^{18})^3 \\mathrm{cm}^{-3} = 2.85 \\times 10^{55} \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}\\]\nStep 3:  Next, we need to calculate the average distance between stars. The average distance between stars can be found using the formula:\n\\[d = \\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\right)^{1/3}\\]\nwhere \\(n\\) is the number density of stars.

Therefore, to find \u03c9(r), we can divide v(r) by r.\n\nStep 3: Substitute the given v(r) into the equation v(r) = r\u03c9(r)\nSubstituting the given v(r) = (r/r0) / (1 + r/r0)^(3/2) v0 into the equation v(r) = r\u03c9(r), we get:\n\n(r/r0) / (1 + r/r0)^(3/2) v0 = r\u03c9(r)\n\nStep 4: Solve for \u03c9(r)\nTo solve for \u03c9(r), we can divide both sides of the equation by r:\n\n\u03c9(r) = [ (r/r0) / (1 + r/r0)^(3/2) v0 ] / r\n\nStep 5: Simplify the expression for \u03c9(r)\nWe can simplify the expression by canceling out the r terms:\n\n\u03c9(r) = [ (1/r0) / (1 + r/r0)^(3/2) ] v0\n\nStep 6: Write the final expression for \u03c9(r)\nTherefore, the expression for \u03c9(r) is:\n\n\u03c9(r) = [ (1/r0) / (1 + r/r0)^(3/2) ] v0\n\nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{[ (1/r0) / (1 + r/r0)^(3/2) ] v0}",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to apply the principles of orbital dynamics, specifically the concept of the center of mass and the relationship between the orbital periods and radii of the two stars in a binary system.\nStep 2:  First, let's recall that in a binary system, the two stars orbit around their common center of mass. The orbital period, \\(P_{\\text{orb}}\\), is the time taken for one complete orbit around this center of mass.\nStep 3:  The problem provides us with the orbital period, \\(P_{\\text{orb}} = 10\\) days, which we need to convert into seconds because the orbital speed is given in \\(\\mathrm{km} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}\\). So, \\(P_{\\text{orb}} = 10 \\times 24 \\times 60 \\times 60 = 864000\\) seconds.\nStep 4:  The orbital speed of Star 1 is given as \\(v_{1} = 20 \\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}\\). We need to convert this speed into meters per second: \\(v_{1} = 20 \\times 10^3 \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}\\).\nStep 5:  The orbital radius of Star 2 is given as \\(r_{2} = 3 \\times 10^{12} \\mathrm{~cm} = 3 \\times 10^{10} \\mathrm{~m}\\).\nStep 6:  We need to find the orbital radius, \\(r_{1}\\), of Star 1 about the center of mass. To do this, we can use the relationship between the orbital periods and radii of the two stars. In a binary system, the orbital periods and radii are related by the masses of the stars. However, since the problem doesn't provide the masses directly, we can use the fact that the center of mass is at the midpoint of the line joining the two stars. Therefore, the ratio of the orbital radii is equal to the ratio of the masses. But without the masses, we can use Kepler's third law, which relates the orbital periods and radii of the two stars. However, since the masses are not given, we can use the fact that the total energy of the system is conserved. Alternatively, we can use the fact that the ratio of the orbital speeds is equal to the ratio of the orbital radii. But since we have the orbital speed of Star 1 and the orbital radius of Star 2, we can use the fact that the orbital speed is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital radius. Therefore, we can set up a proportionality between the orbital speeds and radii of the two stars.\n\nStep 7:  Let's denote the orbital radius of Star 1 as \\(r_{1}\\). Then, the orbital speed of Star 1 is \\(v_{1} = \\sqrt{\\frac{G M}{r_{1}}}\\), where \\(G\\) is the gravitational constant and \\(M\\) is the total mass of the system. Similarly, the orbital speed of Star 2 is \\(v_{2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{G M}{r_{2}}}\\). Since the orbital speeds are given, we can set up a ratio between the orbital speeds and radii:\n\n\\[\\frac{v_{1}}{v_{2}} = \\frac{r_{2}}{r_{1}}\\]\n\nTherefore, we can rearrange this equation to solve for \\(r_{1}\\):\n\n\\[r_{1} = \\frac{r_{2} v_{1}}{v_{2}}\\]\n\nStep 8:  However, we don't have the orbital speed of Star 2. But we can use the fact that the total energy of the system is conserved. Alternatively, we can use the fact that the ratio of the orbital speeds is equal to the ratio of the orbital radii. But since we have the orbital speed of Star 1 and the orbital radius of Star 2, we can use the fact that the orbital speed is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital radius.

  "Step 1: The problem states that we have a radio interferometer with 100 small dishes, each 1 m in diameter, distributed randomly within a 1 km diameter circle. The wavelength is 1 cm. We need to find the angular resolution of the interferometer array for a source directly overhead.\n\nStep 2: First, let's calculate the angular resolution of a single dish. The angular resolution of a single dish is given by the wavelength divided by its diameter. In this case, the wavelength is 1 cm and the diameter of each dish is 1 m. So, the angular resolution of a single dish is 1 cm / 1 m = 0.01 radians.\n\nStep 3: Now, for the interferometer array, the angular resolution is determined by the baseline length between the dishes. The baseline length is the distance between the centers of two dishes. Since the dishes are distributed randomly within a 1 km diameter circle, we need to find the average baseline length.\n\nStep 4: To find the average baseline length, we can use the fact that the dishes are distributed randomly within a circle. The average distance between two points in a circle is given by the radius of the circle. Therefore, the average baseline length is the radius of the circle, which is 1 km / 2 = 0.5 km = 500 m.\n\nStep 5: However, since the dishes are randomly distributed, the actual baseline length can vary. But for the purpose of estimating the angular resolution, we can use the average baseline length. Therefore, the angular resolution of the interferometer array is the wavelength divided by the average baseline length, which is 1 cm / 500 m = 0.000002 radians.\n\nStep 6: Therefore, the angular resolution of the interferometer array for a source directly overhead is 0.000002 radians.\n\nFinal answer: The final answer is \\boxed{0.000002}",

  "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the luminosity of objects, their flux at the observer, and the number of objects observed per square degree on the sky.

From the equation above, we have:\n\n\\[F = \\frac{L}{4\\pi d^2}\\]\n\nSince the distance \\(d\\) is the same for all objects, the flux \\(F\\) is directly proportional to the luminosity \\(L\\). Therefore, if we plot \\(\\log F\\) against \\(\\log L\\), the relationship will be linear with a slope of 1.\n\nNow, let's consider the number of objects observed per square degree, \\(N\\), as a function of flux \\(F\\). Since the total number of objects observed is \\(N_0 \\times \\text{area}\\), and the area is the number of square degrees, the number of objects observed per square degree is \\(N_0\\). Therefore, \\(N\\) is constant and independent of \\(F\\).\n\nTherefore, when we plot \\(\\log N\\) against \\(\\log F\\), the relationship will be a horizontal line, since \\(N\\) is constant. The slope of this line is 0.\n\nTherefore, the slope of the \\(\\log N(>F)\\) vs. \\(\\log F\\) curve for a homogeneous distribution of objects is 0.\n\nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{0}",

  "Step 1: To find a universal Boolean function, we need to determine the number of different possible one-output Boolean functions of two variables. This is equivalent to finding the number of possible functions of the form F(A, B) = C.\n\nStep 2: A Boolean function of two variables can be represented as a truth table with 2^2 = 4 rows, each corresponding to a different combination of inputs (00, 01, 10, 11). The output C for each row can be either 0 or 1, so there are 2^4 = 16 possible functions.\n\nStep 3: However, not all of these functions are distinct. For example, the functions F(A, B) = A and F(A, B) = B are the same. Similarly, F(A, B) = A + B and F(A, B) = A * B are also the same. Therefore, we need to count the number of distinct functions.\n\nStep 4: To count the number of distinct functions, we can use the fact that each function can be represented as a binary string of length 4, where each bit corresponds to the output for a particular input combination. For example, the function F(A, B) = A can be represented as 0011, where the first bit is the output for A=0, B=0; the second bit is the output for A=0, B=1; the third bit is the output for A=1, B=0; and the fourth bit is the output for A=1, B=1.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, the number of distinct functions is equal to the number of binary strings of length 4, which is 2^4 = 16.\n\nStep 6: However, we need to check if all these functions can be constructed using nested F(A, B) functions. If we can construct all 16 functions using nested F(A, B), then F(A, B) is universal.\n\nStep 7: To check this, we can try to construct each of the 16 functions using nested F(A, B) functions. If we can construct all 16 functions, then F(A, B) is universal.\n\nStep 8: Alternatively, we can try to find a function F(A, B) such that any other function can be constructed using nested F(A, B) functions. If we can find such a function, then it is universal.\n\nStep 9: Let's try to find a universal function F(A, B). Let's denote the output of F(A, B) as C. Then, we need to find a function C = F(A, B) such that any other function can be constructed using nested F(A, B) functions.\n\nStep 10: Let's consider the possible values of C. Since C is a Boolean output, it can be either 0 or 1.\n\nStep 11: If C is 0, then the function F(A, B) = 0. In this case, any other function can be constructed by using F(A, B) = 0 as a subfunction. For example, if we want to construct the function F(A, B) = A, we can use F(A, B) = 0 as a subfunction: F(A, B) = A + F(A, B) = A + 0 = A.\n\nStep 12: Similarly, if C is 1, then the function F(A, B) = 1. In this case, any other function can be constructed by using F(A, B) = 1 as a subfunction. For example, if we want to construct the function F(A, B) = A, we can use F(A, B) = 1 as a subfunction: F(A, B) = A + F(A, B) = A + 1 = A.\n\nStep 13: Therefore, if we can find a function F(A, B) such that either C = 0 or C = 1, then any other function can be constructed using nested F(A, B) functions.\n\nStep 14: Let's try to find such a function. Let's consider the following function:\n\nF(A, B) = A + B\n\nStep 15: Let's analyze this function. When A = 0, B = 0, F(A, B) = 0 + 0 = 0. When A = 0, B = 1, F(A, B) = 0 + 1 = 1. When A = 1, B = 0, F(A, B) = 1 + 0 = 1. When A = 1, B = 1, F(A, B) = 1 + 1 = 1.\n\nStep 16: Therefore, the truth table for F(A, B) = A + B is:\n\n| A | B | F(A, B) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| 0 | 1 | 1 |\n| 1 | 0 | 1 |\n| 1 | 1 | 1 |\n\nStep 17: Let's check if this function is universal. Let's try to construct each of the 16 possible functions using nested F(A, B) functions.\n\nStep 18: Let's start with the function F(A, B) = A. We can construct this function by using F(A, B) = A + F(A, B) = A + 0 = A.\n\nStep 19: Similarly, we can construct the function F(A, B) = B by using F(A, B) = F(A, B) + B = 0 + B = B.\n\nStep 20: We can also construct the function F(A, B) = A + B by using F(A, B) = A + F(A, B) = A + 1 = A + 1.\n\nStep 21: Let's try to construct the function F(A, B) = A * B. We can use F(A, B) = F(A, B) + F(A, B) = 0 + 0 = 0. Then, F(A, B) = F(A, B) + F(A, B) = 0 + 1 = 1. Therefore, F(A, B) = A * B.\n\nStep 22: Similarly, we can construct the function F(A, B) = A + B + C. We can use F(A, B) = F(A, B) + F(A, B) = 0 + 0 = 0. Then, F(A, B) = F(A, B) + F(A, B) = 0 + 1 = 1. Therefore, F(A, B) = A + B + C.\n\nStep 23: Therefore, we can construct all 16 possible functions using nested F(A, B) functions.\n\nStep 24: Therefore, the function F(A, B) = A + B is universal.\n\nStep 25: Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{1}",

So, \\(P(T) = P(T|G) \\cdot P(G) + P(T|G') \\cdot P(G')\\).\n\nStep 7:  Substituting the given values:\n\\[P(T) = 0.95 \\cdot 0.001 + 0.004 \\cdot 0.999\\]\n\nStep 8:  Calculating \\(P(T)\\):\n\\[P(T) = 0.00095 + 0.003996 = 0.004946\\]\n\nStep 9:  Now, plugging into Bayes' theorem:\n\\[P(G|T) = \\frac{0.95 \\cdot 0.001}{0.004946}\\]\n\nStep 10:  Simplifying:\n\\[P(G|T) = \\frac{0.00095}{0.004946}\\]\n\nStep 11:  Dividing:\n\\[P(G|T) = \\frac{0.00095}{0.004946} \\approx 0.1917\\]\n\nStep 12:  Therefore, the probability that a box person actually has the mutant gene if the test indicates that he or she does is approximately 19.17%.\n\nStep 13:  So, the final answer is \\boxed{0.1917}",
  "Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem is about a communication channel where customers arrive at a rate of one per second and each customer shouts either \"B\" for burger or \"Z\" for zucchini. The cooks in the back room can misinterpret the orders 8% of the time. The marketing experts predict that 90% of the orders will be for burgers and 10% for zucchini. We need to find the channel capacity C in bits per second.\n\nStep 2: Identify the channel model\nThis is a discrete-time communication channel with a single input (customer's order) and a single output (cooks' interpretation). The channel has memory, as the cooks can misinterpret the orders. The channel is noisy, with a probability of error (8% misinterpretation).\n\nStep 3: Determine the channel parameters\nLet's denote the input as X (customer's order) and the output as Y (cooks' interpretation). The channel has the following parameters:\n\n- Input alphabet: X = {B, Z}\n- Output alphabet: Y = {B, Z}\n- Transition probabilities:\n  - P(Y = B|X = B) = 0.92 (correct interpretation)\n  - P(Y = Z|X = B) = 0.08 (misinterpretation)\n  - P(Y = B|X = Z) = 0.08 (misinterpretation)\n  - P(Y = Z|X = Z) = 0.92 (correct interpretation)\n- Input probabilities:\n  - P(X = B) = 0.9 (90% of orders are for burgers)\n  - P(X = Z) = 0.1 (10% of orders are for zucchini)\n\nStep 4: Calculate the channel capacity\nThe channel capacity C can be calculated using the formula:\n\nC = max I(X;Y)\n\nwhere I(X;Y) is the mutual information between the input X and output Y.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the formula for the capacity of a binary symmetric channel (BSC):\n\nC = 1 - H(p)\n\nwhere p is the probability of error (8% in this case).\n\nHowever, since the channel is not symmetric (the transition probabilities are not equal), we need to use the formula for the capacity of a binary channel with unequal error probabilities:\n\nC = 1 - H(p1) - H(p2)\n\nwhere p1 and p2 are the probabilities of error for the two possible inputs.\n\nIn this case, p1 = 0.08 (misinterpretation when ordering burger) and p2 = 0.08 (misinterpretation when ordering zucchini).\n\nStep 5: Calculate the channel capacity\nFirst, let's calculate the entropy of the error probabilities:\n\nH(p1) = H(0.08) = -0.08 log2(0.08) - 0.92 log2(0.92) \u2248 0.469\n\nH(p2) = H(0.08) = 0.469 (since the error probabilities are the same for both inputs)\n\nNow, calculate the channel capacity:\n\nC = 1 - H(p1) - H(p2) = 1 - 0.469 - 0.469 = 0.062\n\nAlternatively, we can use the formula for the capacity of a binary channel with unequal error probabilities:\n\nC = 1 - H(p1) - H(p2) = 1 - 0.469 - 0.469 = 0.062\n\nTherefore, the channel capacity C is approximately 0.062 bits per second.\n\nStep 6: Verify the result\nThe channel capacity C represents the maximum rate at which information can be transmitted over the channel without error. In this case, the channel capacity is approximately 0.062 bits per second.\n\nThe customer arrival rate is 1 per second, and the cooks can process one order per second. However, due to the 8% misinterpretation rate, the effective channel capacity is reduced.\n\nTherefore, the channel capacity C is approximately 0.062 bits per second, which is less than the customer arrival rate of 1 bit per second. This means that the channel is not capable of handling the customer arrival rate, and the system will eventually become overwhelmed.\n\nTherefore, the consultant's conclusion that the system will never work because customers can only send one bit per second, the rate at which orders can be accepted, is correct.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{0.062}",

The rate of change of the population is the derivative of \\(x(t)\\) with respect to time, denoted as \\(\\frac{dx}{dt}\\).\n\nThe natural growth rate is \\(k\\), so the population would grow at this rate if there were no harvesting.

  "Step 1: The problem is to compute the complex gain H(\u03c9) of a second-order mass/spring/dashpot system driven by a sinusoidal force Fext(t) = A cos(\u03c9t). The system is described by the differential equation m\u00a8x + b\u02d9x + kx = Fext. We are given m = 1, b = 1/4, and k = 2. We need to find the complex gain H(\u03c9) such that the system response x_p(t) = gA cos(\u03c9t - \u03c6) can be expressed as z_p = H(\u03c9)Fcx, where Fcx is the complex replacement of Fext.\n\nStep 2: To find the complex gain H(\u03c9), we need to solve the differential equation with the complex input Fcx = e^(i\u03c9t) and express the response z_p as a complex multiple of Fcx. The differential equation is m\u00a8x + b\u02d9x + kx = Fext = A cos(\u03c9t). We can replace the input with the complex exponential Fcx = e^(i\u03c9t) and the response with the complex exponential z_p = e^(i\u03c9t). Then, the differential equation becomes m(d^2/dt^2)e^(i\u03c9t) + b(d/dt)e^(i\u03c9t) + ke^(i\u03c9t) = A cos(\u03c9t).\n\nStep 3: Since e^(i\u03c9t) is the complex replacement of cos(\u03c9t), we can substitute it into the differential equation. The derivatives of e^(i\u03c9t) are:\n\nd/dt e^(i\u03c9t) = i\u03c9 e^(i\u03c9t)\n\nd^2/dt^2 e^(i\u03c9t) = -\u03c9^2 e^(i\u03c9t)\n\nSo, the differential equation becomes:\n\nm(-\u03c9^2)e^(i\u03c9t) + b(i\u03c9)e^(i\u03c9t) + k e^(i\u03c9t) = A cos(\u03c9t)\n\nStep 4: Since e^(i\u03c9t) is the complex replacement of cos(\u03c9t), we can equate the coefficients of e^(i\u03c9t) on both sides. The left-hand side is:\n\nm(-\u03c9^2)e^(i\u03c9t) + b(i\u03c9)e^(i\u03c9t) + k e^(i\u03c9t) = (m(-\u03c9^2) + b(i\u03c9) + k)e^(i\u03c9t)\n\nThe right-hand side is A cos(\u03c9t), which can be replaced with (A/2)(e^(i\u03c9t) + e^(-i\u03c9t)). However, since we are looking for the complex gain H(\u03c9), we can express the response as a complex multiple of the input Fcx = e^(i\u03c9t). Therefore, we can write the response as:\n\nz_p = H(\u03c9)Fcx = H(\u03c9)e^(i\u03c9t)\n\nSo, the differential equation becomes:\n\n(m(-\u03c9^2) + b(i\u03c9) + k)e^(i\u03c9t) = H(\u03c9)e^(i\u03c9t)\n\nStep 5: Equating the coefficients of e^(i\u03c9t) on both sides, we get:\n\nm(-\u03c9^2) + b(i\u03c9) + k = H(\u03c9)\n\nTherefore, the complex gain H(\u03c9) is:\n\nH(\u03c9) = m(-\u03c9^2) + b(i\u03c9) + k\n\nSubstituting the given values m = 1, b = 1/4, and k = 2, we get:\n\nH(\u03c9) = 1(-\u03c9^2) + (1/4)(i\u03c9) + 2\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nH(\u03c9) = -\u03c9^2 + (1/4)i\u03c9 + 2\n\nTherefore, the complex gain H(\u03c9) is:\n\nH(\u03c9) = -\u03c9^2 + (1/4)i\u03c9 + 2\n\nStep 6: Therefore, the complex gain H(\u03c9) of the system is:\n\nH(\u03c9) = -\u03c9^2 + (1/4)i\u03c9 + 2\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{-\u03c9^2 + (1/4)i\u03c9 + 2}",

The general form of such an ODE is $\\ddot{x} + b\\dot{x} + cx = 0$, where $b$ and $c$ are constants. In our case, $b = 0$ and $c = -a^{2}$. Since $b = 0$, the ODE reduces to $\\ddot{x} - a^{2} x = 0$.\n\nStep 3: Solve the ODE\nTo solve the ODE $\\ddot{x} - a^{2} x = 0$, we can use the characteristic equation method. The characteristic equation is obtained by substituting $x = e^{rt}$ into the ODE. This gives the equation $r^{2} - a^{2} = 0$. Solving for $r$, we get $r = \\pm a$.

Substituting $t = 0$ into the general solution, we get $x(0) = c_{1} + c_{2} = 1$. Differentiating the general solution with respect to $t$, we get $\\dot{x}(t) = a c_{1} e^{at} - a c_{2} e^{-at}$. Substituting $t = 0$, we get $\\dot{x}(0) = a c_{1} - a c_{2} = 0$. Therefore, we have the system of equations:\n\n$c_{1} + c_{2} = 1$\n\n$a c_{1} - a c_{2} = 0$\n\nStep 5: Solve the system of equations\nFrom the second equation, we can factor out $a$ and get $a (c_{1} - c_{2}) = 0$. Since $a$ is nonzero, we must have $c_{1} - c_{2} = 0$. Therefore, $c_{1} = c_{2}$. Substituting this into the first equation, we get $2 c_{1} = 1$, so $c_{1} = c_{2} = 1/2$.\n\nStep 6: Write the final solution\nTherefore, the solution to the ODE with the given initial conditions is $x(t) = \\frac{1}{2} e^{at} + \\frac{1}{2} e^{-at}$.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{0.5 * (e^(a*t) + e^(-a*t))}",

  "Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe need to find the smallest positive value of k such that all functions of the form x(t) = A cos(\u03c9t - \u03c6), where \u03c6 is an odd multiple of k, satisfy x(0) = 0.\n\nStep 2: Recall the properties of cosine function\nThe cosine function has a period of 2\u03c0. When t = 0, the cosine function is at its maximum value if the argument is 0, and at its minimum value if the argument is \u03c0. Therefore, for x(0) = 0, the argument (\u03c9t - \u03c6) must be \u03c0/2 or 3\u03c0/2.\n\nStep 3: Express \u03c6 in terms of k\nSince \u03c6 is an odd multiple of k, we can write \u03c6 = k\u03c0 for some integer n. Therefore, \u03c6 = n\u03c0, where n is an odd integer.\n\nStep 4: Substitute \u03c6 into the equation\nSubstituting \u03c6 = n\u03c0 into the equation x(t) = A cos(\u03c9t - \u03c6), we get x(t) = A cos(\u03c9t - n\u03c0).\n\nStep 5: Evaluate x(0)\nTo find x(0), we substitute t = 0 into the equation x(t) = A cos(\u03c9t - n\u03c0). Therefore, x(0) = A cos(-n\u03c0).\n\nStep 6: Determine the condition for x(0) = 0\nFor x(0) = 0, we need A cos(-n\u03c0) = 0. Since A is a constant, we need cos(-n\u03c0) = 0.\n\nStep 7: Recall the cosine function\nThe cosine function is zero at odd multiples of \u03c0/2.

  "Step 1: The given differential equation is $\\ddot{x}+b \\dot{x}+x=0$. To find the characteristic polynomial $p(s)$, we need to convert this differential equation into a polynomial equation in terms of $s$, where $s$ is the variable representing the Laplace transform of $x$.\n\nStep 2: The Laplace transform of the differential equation $\\ddot{x}+b \\dot{x}+x=0$ is given by $\\mathcal{L}(\\ddot{x}+b \\dot{x}+x)=0$. Since the Laplace transform of $\\ddot{x}$ is $s^2X(s) - sx(0) - x'(0)$, the Laplace transform of $\\dot{x}$ is $sX(s) - x(0)$, and the Laplace transform of $x$ is $X(s)$, where $X(s)$ is the Laplace transform of $x$.\n\nStep 3: Substituting these expressions into the Laplace transform of the differential equation, we get:\n\n$s^2X(s) - sx(0) - x'(0) + bsX(s) - bx(0) + X(s) = 0$\n\nStep 4: Rearranging the terms, we have:\n\n$(s^2 + bs + 1)X(s) - (s + b)x(0) - x'(0) = 0$\n\nStep 5: Since the initial conditions $x(0)$ and $x'(0)$ are not specified, we can assume that they are zero for simplicity.

  "Step 1: To rewrite the function $\\operatorname{Re} \\frac{e^{i t}}{2+2 i}$ in the form $A \\cos (\\omega t-\\phi)$, we first need to simplify the expression $\\frac{e^{i t}}{2+2 i}$.\n\nStep 2: The denominator $2+2 i$ can be written in polar form. To do this, we need to find the magnitude and angle of the complex number $2+2 i$. The magnitude is given by $\\sqrt{2^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$. The angle can be found using the arctangent: $\\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{2}{2}\\right) = \\arctan(1) = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$.\n\nStep 3: Therefore, the denominator can be written as $2\\sqrt{2}e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{4}}$. So, the expression becomes $\\frac{e^{i t}}{2\\sqrt{2}e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{4}}}$. We can simplify this by dividing the numerator and denominator by $e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{4}}$.\n\nStep 4: Dividing by $e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{4}}$ is equivalent to multiplying by $e^{-i\\frac{\\pi}{4}}$. So, the expression becomes $\\frac{e^{i t} \\cdot e^{-i\\frac{\\pi}{4}}}{2\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\nStep 5: Using the property of exponents, $e^{i t} \\cdot e^{-i\\frac{\\pi}{4}} = e^{i(t - \\frac{\\pi}{4})}$. Therefore, the expression simplifies to $\\frac{e^{i(t - \\frac{\\pi}{4})}}{2\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\nStep 6: Now, we need to find the real part of this expression. The real part of $e^{i\\theta}$ is $\\cos\\theta$. So, the real part of $\\frac{e^{i(t - \\frac{\\pi}{4})}}{2\\sqrt{2}}$ is $\\frac{\\cos(t - \\frac{\\pi}{4})}{2\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\nStep 7: Therefore, the function $\\operatorname{Re} \\frac{e^{i t}}{2+2 i}$ can be written as $\\frac{\\cos(t - \\frac{\\pi}{4})}{2\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\nStep 8: Comparing this with the form $A \\cos (\\omega t-\\phi)$, we can see that $A = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}}$, $\\omega = 1$, and $\\phi = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$.\n\nStep 9: Therefore, the function can be written as $\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}} \\cos (t - \\frac{\\pi}{4})$.\n\nStep 10: So, the final answer is \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}}}",

  "Step 1: The given differential equation is \\(\\dot{z} + 2z = e^{2it}\\). To solve this, we can use an integrating factor or separate variables. However, since the right-hand side is an exponential function, it might be more convenient to use an integrating factor. Alternatively, we can also use the method of variation of parameters, but for this problem, the integrating factor method seems more straightforward.\n\nStep 2: The differential equation is \\(\\dot{z} + 2z = e^{2it}\\). The standard form of a first-order linear differential equation is \\(\\dot{z} + P(t)z = Q(t)\\), where \\(P(t) = 2\\) and \\(Q(t) = e^{2it}\\). The integrating factor is given by \\(e^{\\int P(t) dt}\\). In this case, \\(P(t) = 2\\), so the integrating factor is \\(e^{\\int 2 dt} = e^{2t}\\).\n\nStep 3: Multiply both sides of the differential equation by the integrating factor \\(e^{2t}\\). This gives us \\(e^{2t}\\dot{z} + 2e^{2t}z = e^{2t}e^{2it}\\). The left-hand side is the derivative of \\(e^{2t}z\\), so we can write this as \\(\\frac{d}{dt}(e^{2t}z) = e^{2t}e^{2it}\\).\n\nStep 4: Now, we can integrate both sides with respect to \\(t\\). The left-hand side is \\(\\int \\frac{d}{dt}(e^{2t}z) dt = e^{2t}z + C\\), where \\(C\\) is a constant. The right-hand side is \\(\\int e^{2t}e^{2it} dt\\). To integrate this, we can use the fact that \\(e^{2t}e^{2it} = e^{2t}(\\cos(2t) + i\\sin(2t))\\). So, the integral is \\(\\int e^{2t}(\\cos(2t) + i\\sin(2t)) dt\\).\n\nStep 5: To integrate \\(e^{2t}(\\cos(2t) + i\\sin(2t))\\), we can use the fact that the integral of \\(e^{at}\\cos(bt)\\) is \\(\\frac{e^{at}}{a^2 + b^2}(a\\cos(bt) - b\\sin(bt))\\), and similarly for the sine term. So, the integral is \\(\\frac{e^{2t}}{4 + 4}(\\cos(2t) + 2i\\sin(2t)) + C\\), which simplifies to \\(\\frac{e^{2t}}{4}(\\cos(2t) + 2i\\sin(2t)) + C\\).\n\nStep 6: Therefore, the general solution is \\(e^{2t}z = \\frac{e^{2t}}{4}(\\cos(2t) + 2i\\sin(2t)) + C\\). To solve for \\(z\\), we divide both sides by \\(e^{2t}\\), which gives us \\(z = \\frac{1}{4}(\\cos(2t) + 2i\\sin(2t)) + \\frac{C}{e^{2t}}\\).\n\nStep 7: Therefore, the general solution is \\(z = \\frac{1}{4}(\\cos(2t) + 2i\\sin(2t)) + \\frac{C}{e^{2t}}\\). Since \\(C\\) can be any complex number, we can write it as \\(C = C_1 + iC_2\\), where \\(C_1\\) and \\(C_2\\) are real constants.

  "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem is to find the settling time \\(t_{s}\\) for the first-order system \\(\\tau \\dot{y} + y = u\\) with a unit step input from zero initial conditions. The settling time is the time it takes for the output \\(y\\) to settle within an error \\(\\pm \\Delta\\) from the final value of 1.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the definition of settling time\nThe settling time \\(t_{s}\\) is the time it takes for the output to settle within a certain percentage of the final value. In this case, the final value is 1, and the error is \\(\\pm \\Delta\\). The settling time is typically defined as the time when the output is within \\(\\pm 2\\%\\) of the final value, but here it is specified as \\(\\pm \\Delta\\).\n\n## Step 3: Solve the system\nTo solve the system, we can use the Laplace transform. The system is given by \\(\\tau \\dot{y} + y = u\\). Taking the Laplace transform of both sides, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\tau sY(s) + Y(s) = U(s)\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(Y(s)\\) is the Laplace transform of \\(y(t)\\) and \\(U(s)\\) is the Laplace transform of \\(u(t)\\).\n\n## Step 4: Specify the input\nThe input is a unit step, so \\(u(t) = 1\\) for \\(t \\geq 0\\). The Laplace transform of a unit step is \\(U(s) = \\frac{1}{s}\\).\n\n## Step 5: Solve for Y(s)\nSubstituting the input into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\tau sY(s) + Y(s) = \\frac{1}{s}\n\\]\n\nRearranging, we get:\n\n\\[\nY(s) = \\frac{1}{s(\\tau s + 1)}\n\\]\n\n## Step 6: Find the inverse Laplace transform\nTo find the inverse Laplace transform, we can use partial fraction decomposition. Let's decompose the expression:\n\n\\[\nY(s) = \\frac{1}{s(\\tau s + 1)} = \\frac{A}{s} + \\frac{B}{\\tau s + 1}\n\\]\n\n## Step 7: Solve for A and B\nMultiplying both sides by \\(s(\\tau s + 1)\\), we get:\n\n\\[\n1 = A(\\tau s + 1) + B s\n\\]\n\nSetting \\(s = 0\\), we get:\n\n\\[\n1 = A\n\\]\n\nSetting \\(s = -\\frac{1}{\\tau}\\), we get:\n\n\\[\n1 = -\\frac{A}{\\tau} + B\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(A = 1\\), we get:\n\n\\[\n1 = -\\frac{1}{\\tau} + B\n\\]\n\nSolving for B, we get:\n\n\\[\nB = 1 + \\frac{1}{\\tau} = \\frac{\\tau + 1}{\\tau}\n\\]\n\n## Step 8: Write the inverse Laplace transform\nTherefore, the inverse Laplace transform is:\n\n\\[\ny(t) = \\frac{1}{\\tau} + \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{\\tau}\\right)e^{-\\frac{t}{\\tau}}\n\\]\n\n## Step 9: Find the final value\nThe final value is the value of \\(y(t)\\) as \\(t \\to \\infty\\). Since the exponential term decays to zero, the final value is:\n\n\\[\ny(\\infty) = \\frac{1}{\\tau}\n\\]\n\n## Step 10: Find the settling time\nThe settling time is the time when the output is within \\(\\pm \\Delta\\) of the final value. Therefore, we need to solve the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\left|\\frac{1}{\\tau} + \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{\\tau}\\right)e^{-\\frac{t}{\\tau}} - \\frac{1}{\\tau}\\right| \\leq \\Delta\n\\]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{\\tau}\\right)e^{-\\frac{t}{\\tau}} \\leq \\Delta\n\\]\n\n## Step 11: Solve for t\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{\\tau}\\right) - \\frac{t}{\\tau} \\leq \\ln(\\Delta)\n\\]\n\nRearranging, we get:\n\n\\[\nt \\geq \\tau \\left(\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{\\tau}\\right) - \\ln(\\Delta)\\right)\n\\]\n\n## Step 12: Simplify the expression\nLet's simplify the expression inside the parentheses:\n\n\\[\n\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{\\tau}\\right) - \\ln(\\Delta) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 + \\frac{1}{\\tau}}{\\Delta}\\right)\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the settling time is:\n\n\\[\nt_{s} = \\tau \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 + \\frac{1}{\\tau}}{\\Delta}\\right)\n\\]\n\n## Step 13: Write the final answer\nTherefore, the settling time is:\n\n\\[\nt_{s} = \\tau \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 + \\frac{1}{\\tau}}{\\Delta}\\right)\n\\]\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{\\tau \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 + \\frac{1}{\\tau}}{\\Delta}\\right)}",

  "To solve this problem, we need to apply the unit step in force separately to a mass \\(m\\), a dashpot \\(c\\), and a spring \\(k\\). We will model each element separately and then combine the results to find the total velocity of the mass.\n\n## Step 1: Model the mass\nThe mass \\(m\\) is subject to a unit step force \\(F(t) = F_0 u_S(t)\\), where \\(F_0\\) is the magnitude of the force and \\(u_S(t)\\) is the unit step function. The equation of motion for the mass is given by Newton's second law:\n\n\\[m \\frac{d^2 x}{d t^2} = F_0 u_S(t)\\]\n\nSince the initial velocity and position are zero, the equation can be written as:\n\n\\[m \\frac{d^2 x}{d t^2} = F_0 u_S(t)\\]\n\nTo solve this differential equation, we can use the Laplace transform. Let's denote the Laplace transform of \\(x(t)\\) as \\(X(s)\\).

  "To formulate the state-determined equation of motion for the velocity \\(v\\) as output and the force \\(f\\) as input, we need to consider the dynamics of the mass \\(m\\) under the influence of the applied force \\(f\\) and the friction force. \n\nFirst, let's recall Newton's second law of motion, which states that the net force acting on an object is equal to its mass times its acceleration. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n\n\\[F_{net} = m \\cdot a\\]\n\nwhere \\(F_{net}\\) is the net force, \\(m\\) is the mass, and \\(a\\) is the acceleration.\n\nIn this problem, the net force is the sum of the applied force \\(f\\) and the friction force. The friction force can be modeled as a linear friction element with coefficient \\(b\\), which means that the friction force is proportional to the velocity of the mass. Therefore, the friction force can be written as:\n\n\\[F_{friction} = -b \\cdot v\\]\n\nwhere the negative sign indicates that the friction force opposes the motion.\n\nSo, the net force is:\n\n\\[F_{net} = f - b \\cdot v\\]\n\nSubstituting this into Newton's second law, we get:\n\n\\[f - b \\cdot v = m \\cdot a\\]\n\nSince acceleration is the derivative of velocity with respect to time, we can write:\n\n\\[a = \\frac{dv}{dt}\\]\n\nTherefore, the equation of motion becomes:\n\n\\[f - b \\cdot v = m \\cdot \\frac{dv}{dt}\\]\n\nRearranging this equation to isolate the derivative of velocity, we get:\n\n\\[\\frac{dv}{dt} = \\frac{1}{m} \\left(f - b \\cdot v\\right)\\]\n\nThis is a first-order linear differential equation in terms of velocity \\(v\\). The input is the force \\(f\\), and the output is the velocity \\(v\\).\n\nTherefore, the state-determined equation of motion for the velocity \\(v\\) as output and the force \\(f\\) as input is:\n\n\\[\\frac{dv}{dt} = \\frac{1}{m} \\left(f - b \\cdot v\\right)\\]\n\nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{\\frac{1}{m} \\left(f - b \\cdot v\\right)}",

  "Step 1:  The problem requires finding the inverse Laplace transform of the given frequency-domain expression $F(s) = -\\frac{(4 s-10)}{s(s+2)(s+5)}$. To solve this, we can use partial fraction decomposition to break down the expression into simpler terms, which can then be transformed back into the time domain using the inverse Laplace transform.\n\nStep 2:  First, let's express the given function as a partial fraction decomposition. The denominator is $s(s+2)(s+5)$, so we can write $F(s)$ as:\n\n$$F(s) = -\\frac{(4 s-10)}{s(s+2)(s+5)} = -\\frac{A}{s} - \\frac{B}{s+2} - \\frac{C}{s+5}$$\n\nwhere $A$, $B$, and $C$ are constants to be determined.\n\nStep 3:  To find these constants, we multiply both sides by the denominator $s(s+2)(s+5)$ to clear the fractions:\n\n$$-(4 s-10) = A(s+2)(s+5) + B s(s+5) + C s(s+2)$$\n\nStep 4:  Now, we can solve for $A$, $B$, and $C$ by choosing suitable values of $s$ that will make some terms disappear. Let's set $s=0$ to solve for $A$:\n\n$$-(4 \\cdot 0 -10) = A(0+2)(0+5) + B \\cdot 0 + C \\cdot 0$$\n\n$$10 = 10A$$\n\nSo, $A = 1$.\n\nStep 5:  Next, let's set $s=-2$ to solve for $B$:\n\n$$-(4(-2)-10) = A(-2+2)(-2+5) + B(-2)(-2+5) + C(-2)(-2+2)$$\n\n$$-(-8-10) = 0 + B(-2)(3) + 0$$\n\n$$18 = -6B$$\n\nSo, $B = -3$.\n\nStep 6:  Finally, let's set $s=-5$ to solve for $C$:\n\n$$-(4(-5)-10) = A(-5+2)(-5+5) + B(-5)(-5+5) + C(-5)(-5+2)$$\n\n$$-( -20 -10) = 0 + 0 + C(-5)(-3)$$\n\n$$30 = 15C$$\n\nSo, $C = 2$.\n\nStep 7:  Therefore, the partial fraction decomposition is:\n\n$$F(s) = -\\frac{1}{s} + \\frac{3}{s+2} + \\frac{2}{s+5}$$\n\nStep 8:  Now, we can find the inverse Laplace transform of each term:\n\n1. $\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left(-\\frac{1}{s}\\right) = -u(t)$\n\n2. $\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left(\\frac{3}{s+2}\\right) = 3e^{-2t}u(t)$\n\n3. $\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left(\\frac{2}{s+5}\\right) = 2e^{-5t}u(t)$\n\nStep 9:  Therefore, the inverse Laplace transform of $F(s)$ is:\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}^{-1}(F(s)) = -u(t) + 3e^{-2t}u(t) + 2e^{-5t}u(t)$$\n\nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{-u(t) + 3e^{-2t}u(t) + 2e^{-5t}u(t)}",

  "Step 1:  The problem requires finding the inverse Laplace transform of the given frequency-domain expression $F(s) = \\frac{4}{s^2(s^2+4)}$. To solve this, we can use partial fraction decomposition to break down the expression into simpler terms that can be easily inverted.\nStep 2:  First, we need to decompose the given expression into partial fractions. The denominator can be factored as $s^2(s^2+4) = s^2(s^2+2^2) = s^2(s+2i)(s-2i)$. Therefore, we can express $F(s)$ as a sum of four terms: $\\frac{A}{s} + \\frac{B}{s^2} + \\frac{C}{s+2i} + \\frac{D}{s-2i}$.\nStep 3:  To find the coefficients $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$, we multiply both sides by the denominator $s^2(s^2+4)$ to clear the fractions. This gives us the equation $4 = A(s^2)(s^2+4) + B(s)(s^2+4) + C(s)(s^2) + D(s)(s^2)$.\nStep 4:  We can then solve for the coefficients by choosing suitable values of $s$ that will make some terms disappear. Setting $s=0$ gives $4 = 4A$, so $A=1$. Setting $s=2i$ gives $4 = 4C$, so $C=1$. Setting $s=-2i$ gives $4 = 4D$, so $D=1$. Finally, setting $s=0$ again gives $4 = 4B$, so $B=1$.\nStep 5:  Therefore, the partial fraction decomposition is $F(s) = \\frac{1}{s} + \\frac{1}{s^2} + \\frac{1}{s+2i} + \\frac{1}{s-2i}$.\nStep 6:  Now, we need to find the inverse Laplace transform of each term. The inverse Laplace transform of $\\frac{1}{s}$ is $1$, the inverse Laplace transform of $\\frac{1}{s^2}$ is $t$, the inverse Laplace transform of $\\frac{1}{s+2i}$ is $e^{-2it}u(t)$, and the inverse Laplace transform of $\\frac{1}{s-2i}$ is $e^{2it}u(t)$.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the inverse Laplace transform of $F(s)$ is $1 + t + e^{-2it}u(t) + e^{2it}u(t)$.\nStep 8:  Since $e^{-2it}u(t)$ and $e^{2it}u(t)$ are complex exponentials, we can express them in terms of sine and cosine functions using Euler's formula: $e^{ix} = \\cos(x) + i\\sin(x)$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, $e^{-2it}u(t) = \\cos(-2t) + i\\sin(-2t)u(t) = \\cos(2t) - i\\sin(2t)u(t)$, and $e^{2it}u(t) = \\cos(2t) + i\\sin(2t)u(t)$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the inverse Laplace transform of $F(s)$ is $1 + t + \\cos(2t)u(t) - i\\sin(2t)u(t) + \\cos(2t)u(t) + i\\sin(2t)u(t)$.\nStep 11:  Combining like terms, we get $1 + t + 2\\cos(2t)u(t)$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the inverse Laplace transform of $F(s)$ is $1 + t + 2\\cos(2t)u(t)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1 + t + 2\\cos(2t)u(t)}",

  "The equation of motion for a pendulum consisting of a mass \\( m \\) attached to a rigid massless rod, suspended from the ceiling and free to rotate in a single vertical plane, can be derived using Newton's second law. Let's denote the angle between the rod and the vertical as \\( \\theta \\). The system input is a horizontal external force \\( f(t) \\), and the system output is the angle \\( \\theta(t) \\).\n\nFirst, we need to resolve the forces acting on the mass \\( m \\). The forces are:\n\n1. Gravity: \\( mg \\) acting downward.\n2. Tension in the rod: \\( T \\) acting along the rod.\n3. External force: \\( f(t) \\) acting horizontally.\n\nSince the rod is massless and rigid, the tension \\( T \\) is the only force acting along the rod. The external force \\( f(t) \\) is applied horizontally, so it does not contribute to the tension in the rod.\n\nTo derive the equation of motion, we need to consider the acceleration of the mass \\( m \\) in the horizontal and vertical directions.\n\nHorizontal direction:\n\nThe horizontal acceleration of the mass is due to the external force \\( f(t) \\) and the component of the tension \\( T \\) in the horizontal direction. Since the rod makes an angle \\( \\theta \\) with the vertical, the horizontal component of the tension is \\( T \\sin \\theta \\). Therefore, the net horizontal force is:\n\n\\[ F_{\\text{horizontal}} = f(t) - T \\sin \\theta \\]\n\nThe horizontal acceleration is:\n\n\\[ a_{\\text{horizontal}} = \\frac{F_{\\text{horizontal}}}{m} = \\frac{f(t) - T \\sin \\theta}{m} \\]\n\nVertical direction:\n\nThe vertical acceleration of the mass is due to the component of the tension \\( T \\) in the vertical direction and the acceleration due to gravity. The vertical component of the tension is \\( T \\cos \\theta \\). Therefore, the net vertical force is:\n\n\\[ F_{\\text{vertical}} = mg - T \\cos \\theta \\]\n\nThe vertical acceleration is:\n\n\\[ a_{\\text{vertical}} = \\frac{F_{\\text{vertical}}}{m} = g - \\frac{T \\cos \\theta}{m} \\]\n\nSince the mass is moving in a single vertical plane, the horizontal and vertical accelerations are related by the equation:\n\n\\[ a_{\\text{horizontal}} = -\\theta' \\theta' \\]\n\nwhere \\( \\theta' \\) is the angular velocity of the pendulum. Therefore, we can write:\n\n\\[ \\frac{f(t) - T \\sin \\theta}{m} = -\\theta' \\theta' \\]\n\nVertical acceleration:\n\n\\[ a_{\\text{vertical}} = \\frac{d^2 \\theta}{dt^2} \\]\n\nTherefore, we can write:\n\n\\[ g - \\frac{T \\cos \\theta}{m} = \\frac{d^2 \\theta}{dt^2} \\]\n\nNow, we need to express \\( T \\) in terms of \\( \\theta \\) and \\( \\theta' \\). Since the rod is massless, the tension \\( T \\) is the only force acting along the rod. Therefore, the net force along the rod is:\n\n\\[ F_{\\text{along rod}} = T - mg \\sin \\theta = 0 \\]\n\nTherefore, \\( T = mg \\sin \\theta \\).\n\nSubstituting this expression for \\( T \\) into the equations above, we get:\n\nHorizontal equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{f(t) - mg \\sin \\theta \\sin \\theta}{m} = -\\theta' \\theta' \\]\n\nVertical equation:\n\n\\[ g - \\frac{mg \\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta}{m} = \\frac{d^2 \\theta}{dt^2} \\]\n\nSimplifying the vertical equation:\n\n\\[ g - g \\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta = \\frac{d^2 \\theta}{dt^2} \\]\n\nTherefore, the equation of motion for the pendulum is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{f(t) - mg \\sin \\theta \\sin \\theta}{m} = -\\theta' \\theta' \\]\n\n\\[ g - g \\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta = \\frac{d^2 \\theta}{dt^2} \\]\n\nThese two equations can be combined into a single second-order differential equation for \\( \\theta(t) \\).\n\nLet's rewrite the horizontal equation as:\n\n\\[ \\frac{f(t)}{m} - g \\sin \\theta \\sin \\theta = -\\theta' \\theta' \\]\n\nSubstituting the expression for \\( T \\) into the vertical equation:\n\n\\[ g - g \\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta = \\frac{d^2 \\theta}{dt^2} \\]\n\nNow, let's rewrite the vertical equation as:\n\n\\[ \\frac{d^2 \\theta}{dt^2} = g - g \\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta \\]\n\nSubstituting this expression into the horizontal equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{f(t)}{m} - g \\sin \\theta \\sin \\theta = -\\theta' \\theta' \\]\n\nTherefore, the equation of motion for the pendulum is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{f(t)}{m} - g \\sin \\theta \\sin \\theta = -\\theta' \\theta' \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{d^2 \\theta}{dt^2} = g - g \\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta \\]\n\nThese two equations can be combined into a single second-order differential equation for \\( \\theta(t) \\).\n\nLet's rewrite the horizontal equation as:\n\n\\[ \\frac{f(t)}{m} = \\theta' \\theta' + g \\sin \\theta \\sin \\theta \\]\n\nSubstituting this expression into the vertical equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{d^2 \\theta}{dt^2} = g - g \\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta \\]\n\nTherefore, the equation of motion for the pendulum is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{d^2 \\theta}{dt^2} = g - g \\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta \\]\n\n\\[ \\theta'' + g \\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta = g \\]\n\nwhere \\( \\theta'' = \\frac{d^2 \\theta}{dt^2} \\).\n\nTherefore, the equation of motion for the pendulum is:\n\n\\[ \\theta'' + g \\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta = g \\]\n\nThis is a nonlinear second-order differential equation for \\( \\theta(t) \\).\n\nSo, the equation of motion for the pendulum is:\n\n\\[ \\theta'' + g \\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta = g \\]\n\nwhere \\( \\theta \\) is the angle between the rod and the vertical, \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \\( f(t) \\) is the external horizontal force.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\\theta'' + g \\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta = g}",

  "Problem: What is the speed of light in meters/second to 1 significant figure? Use the format $a \\times 10^{b}$ where a and b are numbers.\n\nStep 1: Recall the definition of significant figures. Significant figures are the digits in a number that are known to be reliable and certain. The number of significant figures in a measurement or calculation is determined by the least precise measurement or operation involved.\n\nStep 2: The speed of light is a fundamental constant in physics, denoted by c. It is approximately 299,792,458 meters per second. However, the question asks for the speed of light to 1 significant figure.\n\nStep 3: To express a number to 1 significant figure, we round the number to the nearest ten. For example, 123.456 rounded to 1 significant figure is 100, because the first digit (1) is the only significant digit.\n\nStep 4: The speed of light is 299,792,458 meters per second. To round this to 1 significant figure, we need to round to the nearest ten. The first digit is 2, which is less than 5, so we round down to 200,000,000.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, the speed of light in meters/second to 1 significant figure is 200,000,000.\n\nStep 6: Expressing this in the format $a \\times 10^{b}$, where a and b are numbers, we have a = 2 and b = 8.\n\nStep 7: Therefore, the speed of light in meters/second to 1 significant figure is 2 \u00d7 10^8.\n\nStep 8: Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{2 \u00d7 10^8}",
  "Step 1: The problem requires us to give each of the given quantities to the nearest power of 10 and in the units requested. Let's break down each subproblem step by step.\n\nSubproblem 0: Age of our universe when most He nuclei were formed in minutes.\n\nStep 2: The age of the universe when most He nuclei were formed is approximately 3 minutes after the Big Bang. Therefore, we need to convert 3 minutes to the nearest power of 10.\n\nStep 3: Since 3 is less than 10, but greater than 1, the nearest power of 10 is 1. Therefore, 3 minutes is approximately 1 minute.\n\nSubproblem 1: Age of our universe when hydrogen atoms formed in years.\n\nStep 4: The age of the universe when hydrogen atoms formed is approximately 380,000 years after the Big Bang. Therefore, we need to convert 380,000 years to the nearest power of 10.\n\nStep 5: Since 380,000 is between 10^5 and 10^6, the nearest power of 10 is 10^5. Therefore, 380,000 years is approximately 400,000 years.\n\nSubproblem 2: Age of our universe today in Gyr.\n\nStep 6: The age of the universe today is approximately 13.8 billion years. Therefore, we need to convert 13.8 billion years to Gyr.\n\nStep 7: Since 1 billion years is equal to 1 Gyr, 13.8 billion years is equal to 13.8 Gyr. However, the nearest power of 10 is 10 Gyr, which is 10 billion years. Therefore, 13.8 billion years is approximately 10 Gyr.\n\nSubproblem 3: Number of stars in our Galaxy: (Please format your answer as 'xen' representing $x * 10^n$)\n\nStep 8: The number of stars in our Galaxy is approximately 200-400 billion. Therefore, we need to express this number in the format 'xen' where x is the coefficient and n is the exponent.\n\nStep 9: Since 200 billion is between 10^11 and 10^12, and 400 billion is between 10^11 and 10^12, the nearest power of 10 is 10^11. Therefore, 200-400 billion is approximately 2-4 * 10^11.\n\nStep 10: Therefore, the number of stars in our Galaxy is approximately 2-4 * 10^11.\n\nTherefore, the answers are:\n\nSubproblem 0: 1 minute.\n\nSubproblem 1: 400,000 years.\n\nSubproblem 2: 10 Gyr.\n\nSubproblem 3: 2-4 * 10^11.\n\nSo the final answers are:\n\n\\boxed{1} minute.\n\n\\boxed{400000} years.\n\n\\boxed{10} Gyr.\n\n\\boxed{2-4 * 10^11}.\n\nHowever, since the format requires a single number, I will assume that the problem is asking for the answers in the format \"xen\" for subproblem 3. Therefore, the final answer for subproblem 3 is 2-4 * 10^11.\n\nTherefore, the final answers are:\n\n\\boxed{1} minute.\n\n\\boxed{400000} years.\n\n\\boxed{10} Gyr.\n\n\\boxed{2-4 * 10^11}.\n\nHowever, since the format requires a single number, I will assume that the problem is asking for the answers in the format \"xen\" for subproblem 3.

  "## Step 1: Understand the problem context\nThe problem involves Manny Relativirez running towards first base at speed \u03b2, and we need to find how fast he is running in terms of the speed of light, c. The twist is that he sees third base 45\u00b0 to his left, which implies a change in his reference frame.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the key concepts involved\nThe problem involves special relativity, specifically the concept of relative motion and the Lorentz transformation. Since Manny is moving at speed \u03b2 relative to the ground, and we need to find his speed in the ground's reference frame, we'll need to apply the Lorentz transformation for velocity.\n\n## Step 3: Recall the Lorentz transformation for velocity\nThe Lorentz transformation for velocity is given by:\n\nv' = \u03b3(v - u)\n\nwhere v' is the velocity in the new reference frame (ground), v is the velocity in the original reference frame (Manny's), u is the relative velocity between the two frames (Manny's speed), and \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor:\n\n\u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - \u03b2^2)\n\n## Step 4: Determine the relative velocity u\nSince Manny is running towards first base, which is straight ahead, and third base is 45\u00b0 to his left, we need to find the relative velocity u between Manny's frame and the ground. Let's denote Manny's speed as \u03b2. The angle between Manny's direction and third base is 45\u00b0. We can use trigonometry to find the relative velocity u.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the relative velocity u\nLet's denote the speed of light as c. Since Manny is moving at speed \u03b2, and third base is 45\u00b0 to his left, the relative velocity u can be calculated using the velocity addition formula:\n\nu = \u03b2 + v_third\n\nwhere v_third is the velocity of third base in Manny's frame. Since third base is 45\u00b0 to his left, v_third is \u03b2 * sin(45\u00b0) = \u03b2 / sqrt(2).\n\nSo, u = \u03b2 + \u03b2 / sqrt(2) = \u03b2 * (1 + 1 / sqrt(2)).\n\n## Step 6: Substitute u into the Lorentz transformation\nNow we can substitute u into the Lorentz transformation:\n\nv' = \u03b3(v - u)\n\nwhere v = \u03b2, u = \u03b2 * (1 + 1 / sqrt(2)), and \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - \u03b2^2).\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the expression\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\nv' = 1 / sqrt(1 - \u03b2^2) * (\u03b2 - \u03b2 * (1 + 1 / sqrt(2)))\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n\nv' = 1 / sqrt(1 - \u03b2^2) * \u03b2 * (1 - (1 + 1 / sqrt(2)))\n\nv' = 1 / sqrt(1 - \u03b2^2) * \u03b2 * (-1 / sqrt(2))\n\nv' = -\u03b2 / sqrt(2) / sqrt(1 - \u03b2^2)\n\n## Step 8: Rationalize the denominator\nTo rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and denominator by sqrt(1 - \u03b2^2):\n\nv' = (-\u03b2 / sqrt(2)) * sqrt(1 - \u03b2^2) / sqrt(1 - \u03b2^2)\n\nv' = -\u03b2 / sqrt(2) * sqrt(1 - \u03b2^2) / sqrt(1 - \u03b2^2)\n\nv' = -\u03b2 / sqrt(2) * sqrt(1 - \u03b2^2) / sqrt(1 - \u03b2^2)\n\nv' = -\u03b2 / sqrt(2) * sqrt(1 - \u03b2^2)\n\n## Step 9: Simplify the expression\nSince 1 - \u03b2^2 is always positive (since \u03b2 < 1), we can take the square root:\n\nv' = -\u03b2 / sqrt(2) * sqrt(1 - \u03b2^2)\n\nv' = -\u03b2 / sqrt(2) * sqrt(1 - \u03b2^2)\n\n## Step 10: Express the answer in terms of c\nSince \u03b2 is the speed of Manny, which is less than c, we can express the answer in terms of c:\n\nv' = -\u03b2 / sqrt(2) * sqrt(1 - \u03b2^2)\n\nTo express this in terms of c, we can substitute \u03b2 = v / c:\n\nv' = -v / sqrt(2) * sqrt(1 - (v / c)^2)\n\nv' = -v / sqrt(2) * sqrt(1 - v^2 / c^2)\n\nv' = -v / sqrt(2) * sqrt((c^2 - v^2) / c^2)\n\nv' = -v / sqrt(2) * sqrt((c^2 - v^2) / c^2)\n\nv' = -v / sqrt(2) * sqrt(1 - (v^2 / c^2))\n\nv' = -v / sqrt(2) * sqrt(1 - (v^2 / c^2))\n\nv' = -v / sqrt(2) * sqrt(1 - (\u03b2^2))\n\nv' = -v / sqrt(2) * sqrt(1 - \u03b2^2)\n\nv' = -v / sqrt(2) * sqrt(1 - \u03b2^2)\n\n## Step 11: Simplify the expression\nSince \u03b2 is the speed of Manny, which is less than c, we can express the answer in terms of c:\n\nv' = -v / sqrt(2) * sqrt(1 - \u03b2^2)\n\nv' = -v / sqrt(2) * sqrt(1 -

  "Step 1:  The problem involves calculating the energy of the neutrino in the rest frame of the deuteron, given that the two protons have the same energy and impact angle in the lab frame, and the electron is at rest. We need to make the approximations that the deuteron rest mass is \\(2m_{p}\\), and that the electron and neutrino have negligible rest mass compared to the proton rest mass \\(m_{p}\\).\nStep 2:  First, we need to find the energy of the deuteron in the lab frame. Since the two protons have the same energy \\(\\gamma m_{p}\\) and impact angle \\(\\theta\\), we can calculate the total energy of the two protons. The energy of each proton is \\(\\gamma m_{p}\\), so the total energy is \\(2\\gamma m_{p}\\). However, since the protons are moving at an angle \\(\\theta\\), we need to consider the energy in the direction of the deuteron. The energy in the direction of the deuteron is \\(2\\gamma m_{p}\\cos\\theta\\). Therefore, the energy of the deuteron in the lab frame is \\(2\\gamma m_{p}\\cos\\theta\\).\nStep 3:  Next, we need to find the energy of the electron in the lab frame. Since the electron is at rest, its energy is \\(m_{e}\\), which is negligible compared to \\(m_{p}\\). Therefore, the energy of the electron is approximately zero.\nStep 4:  The total energy in the lab frame is the sum of the energies of the two protons and the electron, which is \\(2\\gamma m_{p}\\cos\\theta\\). However, since the electron has negligible energy, the total energy is approximately \\(2\\gamma m_{p}\\cos\\theta\\).\nStep 5:  Now, we need to find the energy of the neutrino in the rest frame of the deuteron. In the rest frame of the deuteron, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the two protons and the electron. Since the electron has negligible energy, the total energy is approximately \\(2\\gamma m_{p}\\cos\\theta\\). However, since the deuteron has rest mass \\(2m_{p}\\), the total energy in the rest frame of the deuteron is \\(2\\gamma m_{p}\\cos\\theta - 2m_{p}\\).\nStep 6:  The energy of the neutrino in the rest frame of the deuteron is the difference between the total energy and the rest mass of the deuteron, which is \\(2\\gamma m_{p}\\cos\\theta - 2m_{p}\\).\nStep 7:  Therefore, the energy of the neutrino in the rest frame of the deuteron is \\(2\\gamma m_{p}\\cos\\theta - 2m_{p}\\).\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{2\u03b3m_{p}cos\u03b8 - 2m_{p}}",

In atomic physics, the number of down quarks in a nucleus can be determined by the number of neutrons, since protons are composed of up quarks.\n\nStep 2: Each neutron is composed of 1 down quark and 2 up quarks. Therefore, the number of down quarks in a neutron is 1.\n\nStep 3: Since a tritium nucleus has 2 neutrons, the total number of down quarks in the neutrons is 2 * 1 = 2.\n\nStep 4: Additionally, the 1 proton in the tritium nucleus is composed of 2 up quarks and 1 down quark. Therefore, the number of down quarks in the proton is 1.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, the total number of down quarks in the tritium nucleus is the sum of the down quarks in the neutrons and the down quark in the proton, which is 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nStep 6: Therefore, the tritium nucleus contains 3 down quarks.\n\nStep 7: Therefore, the final answer is 3.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{3}",
  "Step 1: First, let's recall that a tritium nucleus is composed of 1 proton and 2 neutrons. The atomic number of tritium is 1, which means it has 1 proton. The mass number is 3, which is the sum of protons and neutrons. So, 1 proton + 2 neutrons = 3.\n\nStep 2: The question asks for the number of up quarks in the tritium nucleus. Quarks are the building blocks of protons and neutrons. Protons are composed of 2 up quarks and 1 down quark, while neutrons are composed of 2 down quarks and 1 up quark.\n\nStep 3: Since the tritium nucleus has 1 proton, we need to determine the number of up quarks in that proton. A proton has 2 up quarks and 1 down quark. Therefore, the proton in the tritium nucleus contains 2 up quarks.\n\nStep 4: Additionally, the tritium nucleus has 2 neutrons. Each neutron has 1 up quark and 2 down quarks. Therefore, the 2 neutrons in the tritium nucleus contain 2 * 1 = 2 up quarks.\n\nStep 5: To find the total number of up quarks in the tritium nucleus, we add the up quarks from the proton and the neutrons.

  "## Step 1: Determine the age of the universe when most He nuclei were formed.\nThe age of the universe when most He nuclei were formed is approximately 3 minutes after the Big Bang. This is because during the first few minutes after the Big Bang, the universe was hot and dense, allowing for the formation of light elements, including helium, through nuclear reactions. This period is known as Big Bang nucleosynthesis.\n\n## Step 2: Convert 3 minutes to the nearest power of 10.\nTo convert 3 minutes to the nearest power of 10, we need to determine the nearest power of 10 that is greater than or equal to 3. Since 10^0 = 1, 10^1 = 10, 10^2 = 100, 10^3 = 1000, and 10^4 = 10000, the nearest power of 10 to 3 is 10^1, which is 10.\n\n## Step 3: Express the age in the requested units.\nThe problem asks for the age in minutes, but since we are converting to the nearest power of 10, we can express it as 10 minutes.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{10}",

Therefore, the answer is 3 minutes, which is 3. Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{3}",
  "The age of the universe when most He nuclei were formed is approximately 3 minutes. Therefore, the age of the universe when hydrogen atoms formed is approximately 3 minutes before that, which is 3 - 3 = 0 minutes. However, since the age of the universe is typically measured in years, we need to convert 0 minutes to years. There are 60 minutes in an hour, 24 hours in a day, 365.25 days in a year, so there are 60 * 24 * 365.25 = 525,600 minutes in a year. Therefore, 0 minutes is 0 / 525,600 = 0 years. However, since the problem asks for the age in years, we need to round to the nearest power of 10. The nearest power of 10 to 0 is 10^0 = 1. Therefore, the age of the universe when hydrogen atoms formed is approximately 1 year.\n\nAlternatively, since the age of the universe is approximately 13.8 billion years, and the formation of hydrogen atoms occurred about 3 minutes after the Big Bang, which is an incredibly small fraction of the total age. Therefore, the age of the universe when hydrogen atoms formed is approximately 0 years, which is 10^0 = 1 year when rounded to the nearest power of 10.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{1} year.",
  "Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem is asking for the longest wavelength of light that has enough energy to eject electrons from a potassium photodiode surface. The energy required to remove one mole of electrons is given as $2.15 \\times 10^{5} J$. We need to find the wavelength of light with energy equal to or greater than this value.\n\nStep 2: Convert the energy from joules to electronvolts (eV)\nTo compare the energy of light with the energy required to remove electrons, it's more convenient to express the energy in electronvolts (eV). Since 1 eV is the energy gained by an electron when it moves through a potential difference of 1 volt, we can convert joules to eV using the conversion factor: 1 eV = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} J.\n\nTherefore, the energy required to remove one mole of electrons is:\n\\[2.15 \\times 10^{5} J \\times \\frac{1 eV}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19} J} = \\frac{2.15 \\times 10^{5}}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19}} eV\\]\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\\[ \\frac{2.15 \\times 10^{5}}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19}} = 1.344 \\times 10^{24} eV\\]\n\nHowever, since we are dealing with one mole of electrons, which is \\(6.02 \\times 10^{23}\\) electrons, the energy per electron is:\n\\[ \\frac{1.344 \\times 10^{24} eV}{6.02 \\times 10^{23}} = 2.24 eV\\]\n\nSo, the energy required to remove one electron is 2.24 eV.\n\nStep 3: Find the wavelength corresponding to this energy\nThe energy of a photon is given by the equation:\n\\[E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}\\]\n\nwhere \\(E\\) is the energy, \\(h\\) is Planck's constant (\\(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} J s\\)), \\(c\\) is the speed of light (\\(3.00 \\times 10^{8} m/s\\)), and \\(\\lambda\\) is the wavelength.\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for \\(\\lambda\\):\n\\[\\lambda = \\frac{hc}{E}\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[E = 2.24 eV = 2.24 \\times 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} J = 3.58 \\times 10^{-19} J\\]\n\n\\[h = 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} J s\\]\n\\[c = 3.00 \\times 10^{8} m/s\\]\n\nTherefore:\n\\[\\lambda = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} J s) \\times (3.00 \\times 10^{8} m/s)}{3.58 \\times 10^{-19} J}\\]\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\\[ \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34}) \\times (3.00 \\times 10^{8})}{3.58 \\times 10^{-19}} = \\frac{19.878 \\times 10^{-26}}{3.58 \\times 10^{-19}} = 5.56 \\times 10^{-7} m\\]\n\nTo convert meters to nanometers (nm), we multiply by \\(10^{9}\\):\n\\[5.56 \\times 10^{-7} m \\times 10^{9} nm/m = 556 nm\\]\n\nTherefore, the longest wavelength of light with quanta of sufficient energy to eject electrons from a potassium photodiode surface is 556 nm.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{556}",

  "To solve this problem, we need to determine the net charge of arginine at a pH of 1.0. \n\nFirst, let's recall that arginine is a basic amino acid with a pKa of approximately 12.1 for its side chain. However, at a pH of 1.0, the solution is strongly acidic, so we need to consider the ionization of the amino group (-NH2) and the carboxyl group (-COOH) of the amino acid.\n\nAt pH 1.0, the solution is acidic, so the amino group (-NH2) will be protonated to form a positively charged ammonium group (-NH3+). The carboxyl group (-COOH) will be protonated to form a carboxylate group (-COO-), which is negatively charged.\n\nTherefore, at pH 1.0, arginine will have a net positive charge due to the protonation of the amino group and the carboxyl group.\n\nSince the pKa of the amino group is around 9.0 (not 1.0), but at pH 1.0, the amino group is protonated, so it's +1. The carboxyl group is also protonated, so it's -1. Therefore, the net charge is +1 - 1 = 0. However, considering the pKa of the amino group is around 9.0, at pH 1.0, the amino group is fully protonated, so it's +1. The carboxyl group is also protonated, so it's -1.

However, since electrons have negligible mass compared to protons and neutrons, the atomic weight of \\({He}^{++}\\) will be very close to the mass number (A) of the atom, which is the sum of the number of protons and neutrons.\n\nThe atomic number (Z) of helium is 2, which means it has 2 protons. The mass number (A) of \\({He}^{++}\\) is 4, which is the sum of the number of protons (2) and neutrons (2). Therefore, the atomic weight of \\({He}^{++}\\) is approximately equal to its mass number, which is 4 amu.\n\nHowever, to be precise, we need to consider the masses of the individual protons and neutrons. The mass of a proton is approximately 1.007276 amu, and the mass of a neutron is approximately 1.008665 amu. Therefore, the atomic weight of \\({He}^{++}\\) can be calculated as follows:\n\nAtomic weight = (2 protons \u00d7 1.007276 amu/proton) + (2 neutrons \u00d7 1.008665 amu/neutron)\n\nAtomic weight = (2 \u00d7 1.007276) + (2 \u00d7 1.008665)\n\nAtomic weight = 2.014552 + 2.017330\n\nAtomic weight = 4.031882 amu\n\nRounded to 5 decimal places, the atomic weight of \\({He}^{++}\\) is 4.03188 amu.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{4.03188}",

  "Problem: Determine the wavelength of radiation emitted by hydrogen atoms in angstroms upon electron transitions from n=6 to n=2.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to use the Rydberg formula, which relates the energy levels of the hydrogen atom to the wavelength of the emitted radiation. The Rydberg formula is given by:\n\n1/\u03bb = R \\* (1/n\u00b2 - 1/m\u00b2)\n\nwhere \u03bb is the wavelength of the radiation, R is the Rydberg constant (approximately 1.097 \u00d7 10^7 m^-1), n is the final energy level, and m is the initial energy level.\n\nIn this case, the electron transitions from n=6 to n=2, so we need to calculate the wavelength of the radiation emitted when the electron jumps from n=6 to n=2.\n\nFirst, let's plug in the values into the Rydberg formula:\n\n1/\u03bb = R \\* (1/2\u00b2 - 1/6\u00b2)\n\nFirst, calculate the denominators:\n\n2\u00b2 = 4\n6\u00b2 = 36\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n1/\u03bb = R \\* (1/4 - 1/36)\n\nTo subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 36. So, convert 1/4 to 9/36:\n\n1/4 = 9/36\n\nNow, subtract:\n\n1/\u03bb = R \\* (9/36 - 1/36)\n\nCombine the fractions:\n\n1/\u03bb = R \\* (8/36)\n\nNow, simplify the fraction:\n\n8/36 = 2/9\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n1/\u03bb = R \\* (2/9)\n\nNow, multiply both sides by \u03bb to get rid of the fraction:\n\n1 = R \\* (2/9) \\* \u03bb\n\nNow, multiply both sides by 9/2 to isolate \u03bb:\n\n\u03bb = (9/2) / (R \\* 2/9)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n\u03bb = (9/2) / (2/9) = (9/2) \u00d7 (9/2) = 81/4\n\nSo, \u03bb = 81/4 meters.\n\nTo convert meters to angstroms, we need to multiply by 10^10 (since 1 angstrom = 10^-10 meters):\n\n\u03bb (angstroms) = (81/4) \u00d7 10^10\n\nFirst, calculate 81/4:\n\n81/4 = 20.25\n\nSo, \u03bb (angstroms) = 20.25 \u00d7 10^10\n\nMultiply:\n\n20.25 \u00d7 10^10 = 2.025 \u00d7 10^11\n\nSo, \u03bb (angstroms) = 2.025 \u00d7 10^11 angstroms.\n\nHowever, the answer should be a single number, not an expression. Therefore, we need to round the answer to a reasonable number of significant figures. Since the Rydberg constant is given to 3 significant figures (1.097 \u00d7 10^7), we can round the answer to 3 significant figures.\n\nTherefore, \u03bb (angstroms) \u2248 2.03 \u00d7 10^11 \u2248

  "Step 1: First, we need to recall the formula that relates the wavelength of light to its frequency. The formula is given by the speed of light equation: c = \u03bbv, where c is the speed of light, \u03bb is the wavelength, and v is the frequency.\n\nStep 2: The speed of light in vacuum is approximately 3.00 \u00d7 10^8 meters per second. However, the wavelength is given in centimeters, so we need to convert the wavelength from centimeters to meters. Since 1 cm = 0.01 m, we can convert 6.7102 \u00d7 10^-5 cm to meters by multiplying by 0.01.\n\nStep 3: Perform the conversion: 6.7102 \u00d7 10^-5 cm * 0.01 = 6.7102 \u00d7 10^-7 m.\n\nStep 4: Now, we can use the formula c = \u03bbv to solve for v. Rearranging the formula to solve for v gives v = c / \u03bb.\n\nStep 5: Plug in the values: c = 3.00 \u00d7 10^8 m/s, \u03bb = 6.7102 \u00d7 10^-7 m. Calculate v = (3.00 \u00d7 10^8) / (6.7102 \u00d7 10^-7).\n\nStep 6: Perform the division: (3.00 \u00d7 10^8) / (6.7102 \u00d7 10^-7) = (3.00 / 6.7102) \u00d7 10^(8 - (-7)) = (3.00 / 6.7102) \u00d7 10^(8 + 7) = (3.00 / 6.7102) \u00d7 10^15.\n\nStep 7: Calculate the quotient: 3.00 / 6.7102 \u2248 0.4467.\n\nStep 8: Multiply by 10^15: 0.4467 \u00d7 10^15 \u2248 4.467 \u00d7 10^14.\n\nStep 9: Round the result to 4 decimal places: 4.467 \u00d7 10^14 \u2248 4.4670 \u00d7 10^14.\n\nStep 10: Therefore, the frequency v is approximately 4.4670 \u00d7 10^14 Hz.\n\nStep 11: Write the final answer in the required format: \\boxed{4.4670 \u00d7 10^14}",

The energy of a photon is given by the formula E = hf, where h is Planck's constant (approximately 6.626 \u00d7 10^-34 J s) and f is the frequency of the radiation. In this case, the frequency is given as 3.091 \u00d7 10^14 Hz.\n\nStep 2: We need to convert the band gap energy from electronvolts (eV) to joules (J). The conversion factor is 1 eV = 1.602 \u00d7 10^-19 J. So, the band gap energy in joules is 0.7 eV * 1.602 \u00d7 10^-19 J/eV = 1.1214 \u00d7 10^-19 J.\n\nStep 3: The energy of the photon is E = hf = (6.626 \u00d7 10^-34 J s) * (3.091 \u00d7 10^14 Hz) = 2.048 \u00d7 10^-19 J.\n\nStep 4: The energy of the photon must be greater than or equal to the band gap energy for photoemission to occur. Since the energy of the photon (2.048 \u00d7 10^-19 J) is greater than the band gap energy (1.1214 \u00d7 10^-19 J), photoemission is possible.\n\nStep 5: The wavelength of the photon can be calculated using the formula \u03bb = hc / E, where \u03bb is the wavelength, h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light (approximately 3 \u00d7 10^8 m/s), and E is the energy of the photon.\n\nStep 6: Plugging in the values, \u03bb = (6.626 \u00d7 10^-34 J s) * (3 \u00d7 10^8 m/s) / (2.048 \u00d7 10^-19 J) = 9.73 \u00d7 10^-7 m.\n\nStep 7: To express the answer in the required format, n \u00d7 10^x where n is to 2 decimal places, we have 9.73 \u00d7 10^-7 m. Therefore, n = 9.73 and x = -7.\n\nStep 8: Therefore, the wavelength of photoemission is 9.73 \u00d7 10^-7 m.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{9.73 \u00d7 10^-7}",

  "Step 1: Determine the type of material based on its color in transmitted light.\nThe material appears red in transmitted light. This indicates that it is absorbing light in the blue and violet parts of the visible spectrum, which corresponds to energies above the band gap. Therefore, the material is likely a semiconductor.\n\nStep 2: Recall the typical band gap values for semiconductors.\nSemiconductors have band gaps that are typically between 0.5 eV and 3.5 eV.

The energy of the state with n=5 is E_5 = -13.6 / 5^2 = -13.6 / 25 = -0.544 eV.\n\nStep 2: The electron in the ground state has an energy of -13.6 eV.

The light transfers all its energy to the orbiting electron, and we need to find the velocity of this electron after the interaction.\n\nStep 2: To solve this, we need to calculate the energy of the photon (light) first. The energy of a photon is given by E = hc / \u03bb, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and \u03bb is the wavelength of the photon.\n\nStep 3: Let's calculate the energy of the photon. Planck's constant (h) is 6.626 \u00d7 10^(-34) J s, the speed of light (c) is 3 \u00d7 10^8 m/s, and the wavelength (\u03bb) is 4.28 \u00d7 10^(-7) m.

  "Step 1: To find the frequency of radiation that can generate free electrons with a velocity of \\(1.3 \\times 10^{6} {~ms}^{-1}\\) in atomic hydrogen, we need to use the concept of the photoelectric effect. The energy of the photon must be equal to or greater than the work function of the atom plus the kinetic energy of the electron.\n\nStep 2: The work function of atomic hydrogen is approximately 13.6 eV. The kinetic energy of the electron can be calculated using the formula \\(KE = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2\\), where \\(m\\) is the mass of the electron (\\(9.11 \\times 10^{-31} kg\\)) and \\(v\\) is the velocity of the electron (\\(1.3 \\times 10^{6} {~ms}^{-1}\\)).\n\nStep 3: First, let's calculate the kinetic energy of the electron.

  "Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem states that the Soviet Union and the United States together exploded about ten hydrogen devices underground per year. Each explosion converted about 10 g of matter into an equivalent amount of energy. We need to calculate how many kJ of energy were released per device.\n\nStep 2: Recall Einstein's mass-energy equivalence formula\nEinstein's mass-energy equivalence formula is E = mc^2, where E is the energy released, m is the mass converted, and c is the speed of light (approximately 3 \u00d7 10^8 m/s).\n\nStep 3: Convert mass from grams to kilograms\nFirst, we need to convert the mass from grams to kilograms. Since 1 kg = 1000 g, 10 g is equal to 0.01 kg.\n\nStep 4: Calculate energy released per device\nUsing the mass-energy equivalence formula, we can calculate the energy released per device. Plugging in the values, E = 0.01 kg * (3 \u00d7 10^8 m/s)^2.\n\nStep 5: Perform the calculation\nE = 0.01 kg * (3 \u00d7 10^8 m/s)^2 = 0.01 kg * 9 \u00d7 10^16 m^2/s^2 = 9 \u00d7 10^14 J.\n\nStep 6: Convert joules to kilojoules\nSince 1 kJ = 1000 J, we can convert 9 \u00d7 10^14 J to kJ by dividing by 1000. So, 9 \u00d7 10^14 J / 1000 = 9 \u00d7 10^11 kJ.\n\nStep 7: Format the answer as n \u00d7 10^x\nThe problem asks to format the answer as n \u00d7 10^x. In this case, n is 9 and x is 11. Therefore, the answer is 9 \u00d7 10^11 kJ.\n\nStep 8: Write the final answer\nThe final answer is \\boxed{9 \u00d7 10^11}",

  "Step 1: First, let's recall the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between CO and O2 to form CO2. The balanced equation is 2CO + O2 \u2192 2CO2.\n\nStep 2: From the balanced equation, we can see that 2 moles of CO react with 1 mole of O2 to produce 2 moles of CO2. Therefore, the coefficient of CO is 2.\n\nStep 3: To find the coefficient of O2, we can see from the balanced equation that 1 mole of O2 is required to react with 2 moles of CO. So, the coefficient of O2 is 1.\n\nStep 4: Similarly, the coefficient of CO2 is 2.\n\nStep 5: Now, let's solve the problem. We are given that 32.0 g of oxygen react with CO to form CO2. We need to find how much CO was consumed in this reaction.\n\nStep 6: First, let's calculate the number of moles of oxygen. The molar mass of O2 is 32.0 g/mol. So, the number of moles of oxygen is 32.0 g / 32.0 g/mol = 1 mol.\n\nStep 7: From the balanced equation, 1 mole of O2 reacts with 2 moles of CO. Therefore, 1 mole of O2 will consume 2 moles of CO.\n\nStep 8: Since 1 mole of O2 is 32.0 g, 1 mole of CO is 28.0 g (molar mass of CO is 28.0 g/mol). Therefore, 2 moles of CO will be 2 * 28.0 g = 56.0 g.\n\nStep 9: Therefore, the amount of CO consumed in this reaction is 56.0 g.\n\nStep 10: Rounding to 1 decimal place, the amount of CO consumed is 56.0 g.\n\nStep 11: Therefore, the final answer is 56.0 g.\n\nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{56.0}",

  "Problem: For a proton which has been subjected to an accelerating potential (V) of 15 Volts, determine its deBroglie wavelength in m. Please format your answer as $n \\times 10^x$, where $n$ is to 1 decimal place.\n\nStep 1: First, we need to recall the formula for the deBroglie wavelength of a particle. The deBroglie wavelength \u03bb is given by \u03bb = h / p, where h is Planck's constant and p is the momentum of the particle.\n\nStep 2: Since the proton has been accelerated by a potential V, we can use the relativistic energy equation to find its momentum. The relativistic energy of the proton is given by E = \u03b3mc^2, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor, m is the rest mass of the proton, and c is the speed of light. The kinetic energy of the proton is given by K = E - mc^2 = \u03b3mc^2 - mc^2 = (\u03b3 - 1)mc^2. Since the proton has been accelerated by a potential V, the kinetic energy is equal to eV, where e is the charge of the proton. Therefore, (\u03b3 - 1)mc^2 = eV.\n\nStep 3: We can solve for \u03b3: \u03b3 = 1 + eV / (mc^2). Then, the momentum p can be found using the relativistic energy-momentum relation: E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2. Substituting E = \u03b3mc^2, we get (\u03b3mc^2)^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2. Therefore, p = sqrt((\u03b3^2 - 1)mc^2 / c^2).\n\nStep 4: Since \u03b3 = 1 + eV / (mc^2), we can substitute this into the expression for p: p = sqrt(((1 + eV / (mc^2))^2 - 1)mc^2 / c^2) = sqrt((2eV / (mc^2))mc^2 / c^2) = sqrt(2eV / c^2).\n\nStep 5: Now, we can substitute the values of the constants: e = 1.602e-19 C, m = 1.673e-27 kg, c = 3e8 m/s, V = 15 V. Plugging these into the expression for p: p = sqrt(2 * 1.602e-19 * 15 / (3e8)^2) = sqrt(2 * 1.602e-19 * 15 / 9e16) = sqrt(2 * 1.602e-19 * 1.67e-15) = sqrt(3.36e-34) = 1.83e-17 kg m/s.\n\nStep 6: Now, we can find the deBroglie wavelength \u03bb = h / p. The Planck constant h = 6.626e-34 J s. Therefore, \u03bb = 6.626e-34 / 1.83e-17 = 3.61e-17 m.\n\nStep 7: The problem asks for the answer in the format n \u00d7 10^x, where n is to 1 decimal place. Therefore, we can write the answer as 3.6 \u00d7 10^(-17).\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{3.6 \u00d7 10^(-17)}",

Then we can solve for f.\n\nFirst, convert 408 nm to meters:\n\n\\[ 408 \\text{ nm} = 408 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m} \\]\n\nNow, plug this into the formula:\n\n\\[ 408 \\times 10^{-9} = \\frac{3.00 \\times 10^8}{f} \\]\n\nTo solve for f, rearrange the formula:\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{3.00 \\times 10^8}{408 \\times 10^{-9}} \\]\n\nFirst, compute the numerator:\n\n\\[ 3.00 \\times 10^8 \\]\n\nThen, compute the denominator:\n\n\\[ 408 \\times 10^{-9} \\]\n\nThen divide:\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{3.00 \\times 10^8}{408 \\times 10^{-9}} \\]\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{3.00}{408} \\times 10^{8-(-9)} \\]\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{3.00}{408} \\times 10^{8+9} \\]\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{3.00}{408} \\times 10^{17} \\]\n\nCompute the fraction:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3.00}{408} \\approx 0.00735 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ f \\approx 0.00735 \\times 10^{17} \\]\n\n\\[ f \\approx 7.35 \\times 10^{14} \\]\n\nTherefore, the frequency is approximately 7.35 \u00d7 10^14 s^-1.\n\nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{7.35 \u00d7 10^14}",
  "Step 1: First, we need to recall the formula that relates the energy of a photon to its wavelength. The energy of a photon is given by the formula E = hc / \u03bb, where E is the energy, h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and \u03bb is the wavelength of the photon.\n\nStep 2: We are given the wavelength \u03bb = 800 nm. We need to convert this wavelength from nanometers to meters because the speed of light c is typically given in meters per second. 1 nm = 10^-9 m, so 800 nm = 800 * 10^-9 m = 8 * 10^-7 m.\n\nStep 3: Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 * 10^-34 J s. The speed of light c is approximately 3 * 10^8 m/s.\n\nStep 4: Now we can plug these values into the formula E = hc / \u03bb. First, calculate the numerator: h * c = (6.626 * 10^-34 J s) * (3 * 10^8 m/s) = 19.878 * 10^-26 J m.\n\nStep 5: Then divide this by the wavelength \u03bb = 8 * 10^-7 m. So E = (19.878 * 10^-26 J m) / (8 * 10^-7 m) = 2.485 * 10^-19 J.\n\nStep 6: To convert joules to electronvolts (eV), we use the conversion factor 1 eV = 1.602 * 10^-19 J. So, E in eV = (2.485 * 10^-19 J) / (1.602 * 10^-19 J/eV) = 1.55 eV.\n\nStep 7: Rounding to two decimal places, the energy of the photon is 1.55 eV.\n\nStep 8: Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{1.55}",

In a BCC lattice, there is one atom at the center of the cube and one atom at each of the eight corners. Each corner atom is shared by eight adjacent cubes, so each corner atom contributes \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) to the total number of atoms in the unit cell.

The Arrhenius equation is given by:\n\nD = D\u2080 exp(-Ea / (RT))\n\nwhere D is the diffusivity, D\u2080 is a pre-exponential factor, Ea is the activation energy, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nStep 3: Since we have two data points, we can set up two equations using the Arrhenius equation:\n\nAt 1100\u00b0C (1373 K): D\u2081 = D\u2080 exp(-Ea / (8.314 * 1373))\n\nAt 695\u00b0C (968 K): D\u2082 = D\u2080 exp(-Ea / (8.314 * 968))\n\nStep 4: We can write these equations as:\n\nD\u2081 = D\u2080 exp(-Ea / (8.314 * 1373))\n\nD\u2082 = D\u2080 exp(-Ea / (8.314 * 968))\n\nStep 5: Divide the first equation by the second to eliminate D\u2080:\n\nD\u2081 / D\u2082 = exp(-Ea / (8.314 * 1373)) / exp(-Ea / (8.314 * 968))\n\nStep 6: Simplify the right-hand side using the properties of exponents:\n\nD\u2081 / D\u2082 = exp(-Ea / (8.314 * 1373) + Ea / (8.314 * 968))\n\nStep 7: Let's denote the ratio D\u2081 / D\u2082 as r:\n\nr = D\u2081 / D\u2082 = exp(-Ea / (8.314 * 1373) + Ea / (8.314 * 968))\n\nStep 8: We can solve for Ea by taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(r) = -Ea / (8.314 * 1373) + Ea / (8.314 * 968)\n\nStep 9: Rearrange the equation to isolate Ea:\n\nEa = (8.314 * 1373) * ln(r) / (1373 - 968)\n\nStep 10: Compute the value of Ea:\n\nEa = (8.314 * 1373) * ln(r) / 405\n\nStep 11: Now that we have Ea, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find D\u2080. Let's use the first equation:\n\nD\u2081 = D\u2080 exp(-Ea / (8.314 * 1373))\n\nStep 12: Substitute the expression for Ea from step 10:\n\nD\u2081 = D\u2080 exp(-((8.314 * 1373) * ln(r) / 405) / (8.314 * 1373))\n\nStep 13: Simplify the exponent:\n\nD\u2081 = D\u2080 exp(-ln(r) / 405)\n\nStep 14: Since exp(-ln(r)) = 1/r, we have:\n\nD\u2081 = D\u2080 / r\n\nStep 15: Therefore, D\u2080 = D\u2081 * r\n\nStep 16: Now that we have D\u2080, we can find D at 1200\u00b0C (1473 K) using the Arrhenius equation:\n\nD = D\u2080 exp(-Ea / (8.314 * 1473))\n\nStep 17: Substitute the expressions for D\u2080 and Ea:\n\nD = (D\u2081 * r) exp(-((8.314 * 1373) * ln(r) / 405) / (8.314 * 1473))\n\nStep 18: Simplify the exponent:\n\nD = (D\u2081 * r) exp(-ln(r) / (405 * 1473 / 1373))\n\nStep 19: Since 405 * 1473 / 1373 \u2248 405, we have:\n\nD = (D\u2081 * r) exp(-ln(r) / 405)\n\nStep 20: Since exp(-ln(r) / 405) = 1 / (r^(1/405)), we have:\n\nD = (D\u2081 * r) / (r^(1/405))\n\nStep 21: Therefore, D = D\u2081 * r^(1 - 1/405)\n\nStep 22: Since r = D\u2081 / D\u2082, we can substitute this expression:\n\nD = D\u2081 * (D\u2081 / D\u2082)^(1 - 1/405)\n\nStep 23: Simplify the exponent:\n\n1 - 1/405 \u2248 0.9975\n\nStep 24: Therefore, D \u2248 D\u2081 * (D\u2081 / D\u2082)^0.9975\n\nStep 25: Since D\u2081 = 10^(-5) cm\u00b2/s and D\u2082 = 10^(-6) cm\u00b2/s, we have:\n\nr = D\u2081 / D\u2082 = 10^(-5) / 10^(-6) = 10\n\nStep 26: Therefore, D \u2248 10^(-5) * 10^0.9975\n\nStep 27: Compute the exponent:\n\n10^0.9975 \u2248 10^1 * 10^(-0.0025) \u2248 10 * 0.999 \u2248 9.99\n\nStep 28: Therefore, D \u2248 10^(-5) * 9.99 \u2248 9.99 * 10^(-6) cm\u00b2/s\n\nStep 29: Therefore, D \u2248 9.99 * 10^(-6) cm\u00b2/s\n\nStep 30: Round the coefficient to 2 decimal places:\n\nD \u2248 9.99 * 10^(-6) cm\u00b2/s \u2248 9.99 * 10^(-6) cm\u00b2/s\n\nStep 31: Therefore, the final answer is 9.99 * 10^(-6) cm\u00b2/s.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{9.99e-6}",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of diffusion and the formation of a p-n junction in a semiconductor material.\nStep 2:  First, let's recall that when antimony (Sb) diffuses into p-type germanium (Ge), it acts as a donor, converting the p-type material into n-type. The resulting p-n junction is formed at a depth where the concentration of Sb equals the acceptor concentration in the p-type Ge.\nStep 3:  The problem states that the p-n junction is formed at a depth of $3 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{~cm}$ below the surface. We need to find the donor concentration in the bulk germanium.\nStep 4:  The surface concentration of antimony is given as $8 \\times 10^{18}$ $\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, and the diffusion coefficient at $790^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ is $4.8 \\times 10^{-11} \\mathrm{~cm}^{2} / \\mathrm{s}$.\nStep 5:  We can use the equation for the concentration profile of the diffused layer, which is given by the complementary error function (erfc). The concentration at depth x is given by:\n\\[ N(x) = N_{0} \\text{erfc} \\left( \\frac{x}{2 \\sqrt{Dt}} \\right) \\]\nwhere \\( N(x) \\) is the concentration at depth x, \\( N_{0} \\) is the surface concentration, x is the depth, D is the diffusion coefficient, and t is the time.\nStep 6:  We are given that the junction is formed at a depth of \\(3 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{~cm}\\), so we can set up the equation:\n\\[ N(3 \\times 10^{-3}) = N_{0} \\text{erfc} \\left( \\frac{3 \\times 10^{-3}}{2 \\sqrt{4.8 \\times 10^{-11} \\times 3 \\times 3600}} \\right) = N_{0} \\text{erfc} \\left( \\frac{3 \\times 10^{-3}}{2 \\sqrt{4.32 \\times 10^{-10}}} \\right) \\]\nStep 7:  We need to solve for \\( N_{0} \\) using the given values and then find the donor concentration in the bulk germanium.\nStep 8:  First, let's calculate the argument of the erfc function:\n\\[ \\frac{3 \\times 10^{-3}}{2 \\sqrt{4.32 \\times 10^{-10}}} = \\frac{3 \\times 10^{-3}}{2 \\times 6.6 \\times 10^{-5}} = \\frac{3 \\times 10^{-3}}{1.32 \\times 10^{-4}} = 22.73 \\]\nStep 9:  Then, we can look up the erfc value for this argument. Using a calculator or table, we find that erfc(22.73) \u2248 0.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the concentration at the junction depth is:\n\\[ N(3 \\times 10^{-3}) = N_{0} \\times 0 = 0 \\]\nStep 11:  However, this result doesn't make sense because the concentration at the junction depth cannot be zero. Let's re-examine the problem.\nStep 12:  The problem states that the p-n junction is formed at a depth of \\(3 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{~cm}\\), which means that at this depth, the concentration of Sb equals the acceptor concentration in the p-type Ge. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\\[ N(3 \\times 10^{-3}) = N_{0} \\text{erfc} \\left( \\frac{3 \\times 10^{-3}}{2 \\sqrt{4.8 \\times 10^{-11} \\times 3 \\times 3600}} \\right) = N_{0} \\text{erfc} \\left( \\frac{3 \\times 10^{-3}}{2 \\sqrt{4.32 \\times 10^{-10}}} \\right) = N_{0} \\text{erfc} (22.73) \\]\nStep 13:  Since erfc(22.73) \u2248 0, the concentration at the junction depth is approximately zero. However, this is not possible because the concentration at the junction depth should be equal to the acceptor concentration in the p-type Ge. Therefore, the problem might be incorrect, or there might be a misunderstanding.\nStep 14:  Alternatively, we can use the fact that the concentration at the junction depth is equal to the acceptor concentration in the p-type Ge. Let's denote the acceptor concentration as \\( N_{A} \\). Then, at the junction depth, the concentration of Sb is equal to \\( N_{A} \\).

  "Step 1: First, let's recall that the energy of a photon is given by the formula E = hc / \u03bb, where E is the energy, h is Planck's constant (6.626 \u00d7 10^-34 J s), c is the speed of light (3 \u00d7 10^8 m/s), and \u03bb is the wavelength of the light.\n\nStep 2: We are given that one mole of photons has an energy of 171 kJ/mole. To find the energy of one photon, we need to divide this by Avogadro's number (6.022 \u00d7 10^23 photons/mole). So, the energy of one photon is 171 kJ/mole / (6.022 \u00d7 10^23 photons/mole) = 171,000 J / (6.022 \u00d7 10^23) = 2.84 \u00d7 10^-19 J.\n\nStep 3: Now, we can use the formula E = hc / \u03bb to solve for \u03bb. Rearranging the formula to solve for \u03bb gives \u03bb = hc / E. Plugging in the values, we get \u03bb = (6.626 \u00d7 10^-34 J s) \u00d7 (3 \u00d7 10^8 m/s) / (2.84 \u00d7 10^-19 J).\n\nStep 4: Performing the calculation, we get \u03bb = (6.626 \u00d7 10^-34) \u00d7 (3 \u00d7 10^8) / (2.84 \u00d7 10^-19) = (19.878 \u00d7 10^-26) / (2.84 \u00d7 10^-19) = 7.00 \u00d7 10^-7 m.\n\nStep 5: To convert meters to nanometers, we multiply by 10^9 (since 1 m = 10^9 nm). So, 7.00 \u00d7 10^-7 m \u00d7 10^9 nm/m = 700 nm.\n\nTherefore, the wavelength of the light is 700 nm.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{700}",
  "Step 1: First, we need to recall the formula to calculate the energy of a photon. The energy of a photon is given by the formula E = hc / \u03bb, where E is the energy, h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and \u03bb is the wavelength of the radiation.\n\nStep 2: We are given the wavelength of the laser radiation as 9.5 \u03bcm. We need to convert this wavelength from micrometers to meters because the units of Planck's constant and the speed of light are in meters. 1 \u03bcm = 10^-6 m, so 9.5 \u03bcm = 9.5 * 10^-6 m.\n\nStep 3: Planck's constant (h) is approximately 6.626 * 10^-34 J s. The speed of light (c) is approximately 3.00 * 10^8 m/s.\n\nStep 4: Now, we can plug in the values into the formula E = hc / \u03bb. First, calculate the numerator: h * c = (6.626 * 10^-34 J s) * (3.00 * 10^8 m/s) = 1.988 * 10^-25 J m.\n\nStep 5: Then, divide the numerator by the wavelength (\u03bb = 9.5 * 10^-6 m). So, E = (1.988 * 10^-25 J m) / (9.5 * 10^-6 m) = 2.094 * 10^-19 J.\n\nStep 6: To convert the energy from joules (J) to electronvolts (eV), we use the conversion factor: 1 eV = 1.602 * 10^-19 J. So, divide the energy in joules by this conversion factor: (2.094 * 10^-19 J) / (1.602 * 10^-19 J/eV) = 1.308 eV.\n\nStep 7: The problem asks for the energy to two decimal places, so round 1.308 to 1.31 eV.\n\nStep 8: Therefore, the photon energy of the laser generating radiation of 9.5 \u03bcm is 1.31 eV.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{1.31}",
  "Step 1:  To find the density of copper at 100\u00b0C, we need to use the lattice constant and the atomic mass of copper. The lattice constant is given as 3.655 \u00c5, and we need to convert it to cm. Additionally, we need to use the atomic mass of copper, which is 63.55 g/mol.\nStep 2:  First, let's convert the lattice constant from \u00c5 to cm. We know that 1 \u00c5 = 10^-8 cm. So, the lattice constant in cm is 3.655 \u00c5 * (10^-8 cm/\u00c5) = 3.655 * 10^-8 cm.\nStep 3:  Next, we need to calculate the volume of the unit cell. The lattice constant is the edge length of the unit cell. Therefore, the volume of the unit cell is (3.655 * 10^-8 cm)^3 = 5.419 * 10^-23 cm^3.\nStep 4:  The number of atoms in the unit cell of copper is 4 (face-centered cubic lattice). So, the total number of atoms in the unit cell is 4.\nStep 5:  The mass of the unit cell is the number of atoms in the unit cell multiplied by the atomic mass of copper. So, the mass of the unit cell is 4 * 63.55 g/mol = 254.2 g/mol.\nStep 6:  However, we need to convert this mass from g/mol to g/cm^3. To do this, we divide the mass of the unit cell by the volume of the unit cell. So, the density is (254.2 g/mol) / (5.419 * 10^-23 cm^3) = 4.69 * 10^23 g/cm^3.\nStep 7:  However, this is the density in g/cm^3. But we need to convert it to g/cm^3. Since 1 mol = 6.022 * 10^23 atoms, the number of atoms in 1 cm^3 is 6.022 * 10^23 / (5.419 * 10^-23) = 1113.6 atoms/cm^3. Therefore, the mass of 1 cm^3 is 1113.6 * 63.55 g = 70651.3 g/cm^3. But this is the mass of 1 cm^3 of atoms. To find the density of the solid, we need to divide this by the number of atoms in the unit cell, which is 4.

  "The AM band is typically defined as frequencies between 535 and 1605 kHz. The minimum wavelength is the wavelength corresponding to the highest frequency in this range. We can use the formula \u03bb = c / f, where \u03bb is the wavelength, c is the speed of light (approximately 3 \u00d7 10^8 m/s), and f is the frequency.\n\nFirst, we need to find the highest frequency in the AM band, which is 1605 kHz. Convert this to Hz: 1605 kHz = 1605 \u00d7 10^3 Hz = 1,605,000 Hz.\n\nNow, calculate the wavelength using the formula \u03bb = c / f:\n\n\u03bb = (3 \u00d7 10^8 m/s) / (1,605,000 Hz)\n\nFirst, compute the numerator: 3 \u00d7 10^8 = 3,000,000,000 m/s\n\nThen, divide by the denominator: 3,000,000,000 m/s / 1,605,000 Hz = 1,870 m\n\nSo, the minimum wavelength for broadcasts on the AM band is approximately 1,870 m.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{1870}",
  "Step 1: To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the Miller indices of a plane and the directions within that plane in a cubic crystal structure.\n\nStep 2: The (111) plane in an FCC (Face-Centered Cubic) structure is a specific plane with Miller indices (h, k, l) = (1, 1, 1). The Miller indices represent the reciprocals of the intercepts of the plane with the x, y, and z axes. For the (111) plane, the intercepts are 1, 1, and 1, respectively.\n\nStep 3: Directions in a cubic crystal structure are represented by Miller indices [hkl]. The [110] direction is a specific direction with Miller indices [1, 1, 0]. To determine how many different [110]-type directions lie in the (111) plane, we need to find all directions [hkl] that are parallel to [110] and also lie in the (111) plane.\n\nStep 4: A direction [hkl] is parallel to [110] if the ratio of their components is the same. Therefore, we need to find all [hkl] such that h/k = 1/1 = 1 and l = 0, and also h, k, l are integers. However, since the (111) plane has intercepts 1, 1, 1, the direction [hkl] must satisfy the equation h + k + l = 1 (since the intercepts are 1, 1, 1). Therefore, we need to find all [hkl] such that h + k + l = 1, h/k = 1, and l = 0.\n\nStep 5: Since l = 0, the equation h + k + 0 = 1 simplifies to h + k = 1. Since h/k = 1, we can let h = k. Therefore, h + h = 1, so 2h = 1, which implies h = 1/2. However, since h and k are integers, this is not possible. Therefore, the only possibility is h = 1, k = 0, l = 0, which is the [100] direction. Similarly, h = 0, k = 1, l = 0, which is the [010] direction. Therefore, there are two different [110]-type directions in the (111) plane: [100] and [010].\n\nStep 6: Therefore, the number of different [110]-type directions in the (111) plane is 2.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{2}",
  "To find the velocity of an electron subjected to an accelerating potential of 150 Volt, we can use the equation for kinetic energy. The energy imparted to an electron by an accelerating potential of one Volt is \\(1.6 \\times 10^{-19}\\) Joules. Therefore, for a potential of 150 Volt, the energy imparted is \\(150 \\times 1.6 \\times 10^{-19}\\) Joules.\n\nThe kinetic energy of an electron is given by \\(\\frac{1}{2}mv^2\\), where \\(m\\) is the mass of the electron and \\(v\\) is its velocity. Setting the energy imparted by the potential equal to the kinetic energy, we have:\n\n\\[150 \\times 1.6 \\times 10^{-19} = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2\\]\n\nThe mass of an electron is approximately \\(9.11 \\times 10^{-31}\\) kg. Substituting this value into the equation:\n\n\\[150 \\times 1.6 \\times 10^{-19} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 9.11 \\times 10^{-31} \\times v^2\\]\n\nSolving for \\(v\\):\n\n\\[150 \\times 1.6 \\times 10^{-19} = 4.555 \\times 10^{-31} \\times v^2\\]\n\nDivide both sides by \\(4.555 \\times 10^{-31}\\):\n\n\\[v^2 = \\frac{150 \\times 1.6 \\times 10^{-19}}{4.555 \\times 10^{-31}}\\]\n\n\\[v^2 = \\frac{240 \\times 10^{-19}}{4.555 \\times 10^{-31}}\\]\n\n\\[v^2 = 52.73 \\times 10^{11}\\]\n\nTaking the square root:\n\n\\[v = \\sqrt{52.73 \\times 10^{11}}\\]\n\n\\[v = 7.25 \\times 10^5\\]\n\nTherefore, the velocity of the electron is approximately \\(7.25 \\times 10^5\\) m/s.\n\nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{7.25e5}",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to use Bragg's Law, which relates the wavelength of the radiation, the spacing between the atomic planes in the specimen, and the angle of diffraction. The formula is given by \\(2d \\sin \\theta = n\\lambda\\), where \\(d\\) is the spacing between the atomic planes, \\(\\theta\\) is the angle of diffraction, \\(n\\) is the order of the reflection, and \\(\\lambda\\) is the wavelength of the radiation.\nStep 2:  First, we need to determine the wavelength of the tungsten (W) \\(L_{\\alpha}\\) radiation. The wavelength of \\(L_{\\alpha}\\) radiation from tungsten is approximately 0.071 nm.\nStep 3:  Next, we need to find the spacing between the atomic planes in thorium (Th). The atomic radius of thorium is about 0.185 nm. The spacing between the atomic planes can be calculated using the formula \\(d = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2}}\\), where \\(a\\) is the lattice parameter, and \\(h\\), \\(k\\), \\(l\\) are the Miller indices of the plane. For the 4th reflection, the Miller indices are (4, 0, 0), so the spacing is \\(d = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{4^2 + 0^2 + 0^2}} = \\frac{a}{4}\\).\nStep 4:  However, the lattice parameter \\(a\\) is not given. But we can use the fact that the spacing between the atomic planes is related to the atomic radius. For a cubic lattice, the spacing between the atomic planes is approximately equal to the atomic radius. Therefore, we can assume that \\(d \\approx 0.185\\) nm.\nStep 5:  Now, we can use Bragg's Law to solve for \\(\\theta\\). Plugging in the values, we have \\(2 \\times 0.185 \\sin \\theta = 4 \\times 0.071\\). Solving for \\(\\sin \\theta\\), we get \\(\\sin \\theta = \\frac{4 \\times 0.071}{2 \\times 0.185} = \\frac{0.284}{0.37} \\approx 0.768\\).\nStep 6:  Therefore, \\(\\theta = \\sin^{-1}(0.768)\\). Using a calculator, we find that \\(\\theta \\approx 49.17^{\\circ}\\). Rounding to 2 decimal places, the angle is approximately 49.17 degrees.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{49.17}",
  "Step 1:  First, we need to understand the problem and the information given. The metal has a Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) structure, a lattice constant of 3.31 \u00c5, and a density of 16.6 g/cm\u00b3. We are asked to find the atomic weight of this element in g/mole, rounded to 1 decimal place.\n\nStep 2:  To solve this problem, we can use the relationship between the lattice constant, density, and atomic weight for a BCC structure. The lattice constant (a) is related to the atomic radius (r) by the equation a = 4r / \u221a3. The density (\u03c1) is given by \u03c1 = (n \\* M) / (N_A \\* a\u00b3), where n is the number of atoms per unit cell, M is the atomic weight, N_A is Avogadro's number, and a is the lattice constant.\n\nStep 3:  Since the metal has a BCC structure, the number of atoms per unit cell is 2 (one at the center and eight at the corners, but each corner atom is shared by eight cells, so n = 2).\n\nStep 4:  We can rearrange the density equation to solve for M: M = (\u03c1 \\* N_A \\* a\u00b3) / 2.\n\nStep 5:  First, we need to convert the lattice constant from \u00c5 to cm. 1 \u00c5 = 10^-8 cm, so a = 3.31 \u00c5 = 3.31 \\* 10^-8 cm.\n\nStep 6:  Next, we need to calculate the volume of the unit cell, which is a\u00b3. So, a\u00b3 = (3.31 \\* 10^-8 cm)\u00b3 = 3.31\u00b3 \\* 10^-24 cm\u00b3.\n\nStep 7:  Then, we can plug in the values for \u03c1, N_A, and a\u00b3 into the equation for M.\n\nStep 8:  The density \u03c1 is given as 16.6 g/cm\u00b3, N_A is approximately 6.022 \\* 10\u00b2\u00b3 mol\u207b\u00b9.\n\nStep 9:  Substituting these values into the equation, we get M = (16.6 g/cm\u00b3 \\* 6.022 \\* 10\u00b2\u00b3 mol\u207b\u00b9 \\* (3.31 \\* 10^-8 cm)\u00b3) / 2.\n\nStep 10:  Calculating the volume a\u00b3 first: (3.31 \\* 10^-8 cm)\u00b3 = 3.31\u00b3 \\* 10^-24 cm\u00b3 \u2248 3.51 \\* 10^-23 cm\u00b3.\n\nStep 11:  Then, multiplying the density by N_A and a\u00b3: 16.6 g/cm\u00b3 \\* 6.022 \\* 10\u00b2\u00b3 mol\u207b\u00b9 \\* 3.51 \\* 10^-23 cm\u00b3 \u2248 16.6 \\* 6.022 \\* 3.51 \\* 10 g/mol \u2248 346.5 g/mol.\n\nStep 12:  Finally, dividing by 2: M = 346.5 g/mol / 2 = 173.25 g/mol.\n\nStep 13:  Therefore, the atomic weight of this element is approximately 173.3 g/mol when rounded to 1 decimal place.\n\nStep 14:  So, the final answer is \\boxed{173.3}",
  "Step 1:  To find the radius of an iron atom in a BCC (Body-Centered Cubic) unit cell, we need to use the relationship between the lattice parameter (a) and the radius of the atom.\nStep 2:  The lattice parameter (a) is the length of the edge of the unit cell. In a BCC unit cell, the atoms are located at the corners and the center of the cube. The radius of the atom is related to the lattice parameter by the formula: \\(r = \\frac{a \\sqrt{3}}{4}\\).\nStep 3:  However, we are given the density of iron (\\(\\rho = 7.86 \\mathrm{~g/cm^3}\\)) and the mass of the unit cell. The mass of the unit cell can be calculated using the formula: \\(m = \\rho \\times V\\), where \\(V\\) is the volume of the unit cell.\nStep 4:  The volume of a BCC unit cell is given by \\(V = a^3\\). Therefore, the mass of the unit cell is \\(m = \\rho \\times a^3\\).\nStep 5:  The mass of the unit cell is also equal to the mass of the atoms in the unit cell. In a BCC unit cell, there are 2 atoms: one at the center and eight at the corners. However, since each corner atom is shared by eight cells, the effective number of corner atoms per unit cell is 8/8 = 1. Therefore, the total number of atoms in a BCC unit cell is 2.\nStep 6:  The mass of one iron atom is \\(m_{atom} = \\frac{m_{unit cell}}{2}\\).\nStep 7:  The mass of one iron atom can also be calculated using the atomic mass of iron (approximately 55.85 g/mol). Therefore, the mass of one iron atom is \\(m_{atom} = \\frac{55.85 \\mathrm{~g/mol}}{6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\mathrm{atoms/mol}}\\).\nStep 8:  Equating the two expressions for the mass of one iron atom, we can solve for the lattice parameter (a).\nStep 9:  Once we have the lattice parameter (a), we can substitute it into the formula for the radius: \\(r = \\frac{a \\sqrt{3}}{4}\\) to find the radius of the iron atom.\nStep 10:  Let's proceed with the calculations.\n\nStep 11:  First, calculate the mass of the unit cell:\n\\[m_{unit cell} = \\rho \\times V = 7.86 \\mathrm{~g/cm^3} \\times a^3\\]\n\nStep 12:  The mass of one iron atom is:\n\\[m_{atom} = \\frac{m_{unit cell}}{2} = \\frac{7.86 \\mathrm{~g/cm^3} \\times a^3}{2}\\]\n\nStep 13:  Equating this to the atomic mass:\n\\[m_{atom} = \\frac{55.85 \\mathrm{~g/mol}}{6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\mathrm{atoms/mol}}\\]\n\nStep 14:  Setting the two expressions equal:\n\\[\\frac{7.86 \\mathrm{~g/cm^3} \\times a^3}{2} = \\frac{55.85 \\mathrm{~g/mol}}{6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\mathrm{atoms/mol}}\\]\n\nStep 15:  Solving for a:\n\\[7.86 \\mathrm{~g/cm^3} \\times a^3 = \\frac{2 \\times 55.85 \\mathrm{~g/mol}}{6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\mathrm{atoms/mol}}\\]\n\nStep 16:  Convert the right-hand side to g/cm^3:\n\\[\\frac{2 \\times 55.85 \\mathrm{~g/mol}}{6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\mathrm{atoms/mol}} = \\frac{111.7 \\mathrm{~g/mol}}{6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\mathrm{atoms/mol}}\\]\n\nStep 17:  Convert to g/cm^3:\n\\[\\frac{111.7 \\mathrm{~g/mol}}{6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\mathrm{atoms/mol}} \\times \\frac{1 \\mathrm{mol}}{6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\mathrm{atoms}} = \\frac{111.7}{(6.022)^2} \\mathrm{~g/cm^3}\\]\n\nStep 18:  Calculate the value:\n\\[\\frac{111.7}{(6.022)^2} \\mathrm{~g/cm^3} = \\frac{111.7}{36.32} \\mathrm{~g/cm^3} \\approx 3.076 \\mathrm{~g/cm^3}\\]\n\nStep 19:  Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\\[7.86 \\mathrm{~g/cm^3} \\times a^3 = 3.076 \\mathrm{~g/cm^3}\\]\n\nStep 20:  Solving for a:\n\\[a^3 = \\frac{3.076}{7.86} = 0.392\\]\n\nStep 21:  Taking the cube root:\n\\[a = \\sqrt[3]{0.392} \\approx 0.65 \\mathrm{~cm}\\]\n\nStep 22:  Now, calculate the radius:\n\\[r = \\frac{a \\sqrt{3}}{4} = \\frac{0.65 \\mathrm{~cm} \\times \\sqrt{3}}{4} = \\frac{0.65 \\times 1.732}{4} = 0.282 \\mathrm{~cm}\\]\n\nStep 23:  Therefore, the radius of the iron atom is approximately 0.282 cm.\n\nStep 24:  To express this in the required format \\(n \\times 10^x\\), where n is to 2 decimal places, we have:\n\\[0.282 \\mathrm{~cm} = 0.28 \\times 10^0 \\mathrm{~cm} = 0.28 \\mathrm{~cm}\\]\n\nStep 25:  Therefore, the radius of the iron atom is 0.28 cm.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{0.28}",

  "Step 1: To determine the wavelength of the K\u03b1 line for molybdenum (Mo), we need to use the Moseley's law, which relates the frequency of the emitted X-ray to the atomic number (Z) of the element. The K\u03b1 line is emitted when an electron transitions from the L shell to the K shell.\n\nStep 2: The Moseley's law is given by the equation: \u03bd = (3.28 \u00d7 10^8 Z^2) / (h) - (3.28 \u00d7 10^8 Z^2) / (h) + (3.28 \u00d7 10^8 Z^2) / (h) where \u03bd is the frequency of the X-ray, Z is the atomic number, and h is Planck's constant.\n\nStep 3: However, the Moseley's law is typically expressed as: \u03bd = (3.28 \u00d7 10^8 Z^2) / (h) - (3.28 \u00d7 10^8 Z^2) / (h) + (3.28 \u00d7 10^8 Z^2) / (h) where the first term corresponds to the L1 to K transition, the second term to L2 to K, and the third term to L3 to K. The K\u03b1 line is the sum of the L1 to K and L2 to K transitions.\n\nStep 4: Therefore, the frequency of the K\u03b1 line is given by: \u03bd_K\u03b1 = (3.28 \u00d7 10^8 Z^2) / (h) - (3.28 \u00d7 10^8 Z^2) / (h) + (3.28 \u00d7 10^8 Z^2) / (h) = (3.28 \u00d7 10^8 Z^2) / (h) -

  "Step 1: First, we need to determine the lattice parameter (a) of nickel (Ni) at 100\u00b0C. The lattice parameter can be calculated using the density formula: density = (number of atoms per unit cell) * (mass of one atom) / (volume of unit cell). For a cubic unit cell, the volume is a^3. The number of atoms per unit cell for Ni is 4 (face-centered cubic lattice). The mass of one Ni atom is approximately 58.6934 g/mol divided by Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10^23 atoms/mol). Therefore, the mass of one Ni atom is 9.746 x 10^-23 g. The density is given as 8.83 g/cm^3. So, we can set up the equation: 8.83 = 4 * (9.746 x 10^-23) / (a^3). Solving for a: a^3 = (4 * 9.746 x 10^-23) / 8.83. Therefore, a = (4 * 9.746 x 10^-23 / 8.83)^(1/3). Calculating this gives a \u2248 3.52 pm. Step 2: Next, we need to find the second-nearest neighbor distance. In a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice, the first-nearest neighbors are the atoms at the corners of the cube, which are 4 atoms away. The second-nearest neighbors are the atoms at the face centers, which are 6 atoms away. Therefore, the second-nearest neighbor distance is 6 * a. So, the second-nearest neighbor distance is 6 * 3.52 pm = 21.12 pm. Step 3: The problem asks for the second-nearest neighbor distance in pm, which is 21.12 pm. However, the answer needs to be in the format n x 10^x where n is to 2 decimal places. Therefore, 21.12 pm is 21.12 x 10^0 pm. Since 21.12 is already less than 100, the exponent is 0. Therefore, the final answer is 21.12 x 10^0 = 21.12 pm. So, the final answer is \\boxed{21.12}",
  "Silica glass, also known as fused silica or quartz glass, is a type of glass that is made from silicon dioxide (SiO2). It is known for its high melting point and thermal stability. The working temperature for silica glass is typically around 1000\u00b0C to 1200\u00b0C (1832\u00b0F to 2192\u00b0F). However, the exact temperature range can vary depending on the specific application and the desired properties of the glass. For example, in some cases, the working temperature may be as high as 1400\u00b0C (2552\u00b0F) or more. But generally, 1000\u00b0C to 1200\u00b0C is a commonly cited range for silica glass. Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{1000}",
  "To solve this problem, we need to use the Bragg's law for electron diffraction, which is given by:\n\n\\[2d \\sin \\theta = n \\lambda\\]\n\nwhere \\(d\\) is the interplanar spacing, \\(\\theta\\) is the angle of diffraction, \\(n\\) is the order of diffraction, and \\(\\lambda\\) is the wavelength of the electrons.\n\nFirst, we need to find the interplanar spacing \\(d\\) for the \\(\\{220\\}\\) planes of gold. The interplanar spacing can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[d_{hkl} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2}}\\]\n\nwhere \\(a\\) is the lattice parameter of gold, and \\(h\\), \\(k\\), \\(l\\) are the Miller indices of the plane.\n\nFor gold, the lattice parameter \\(a\\) is approximately 4.078 \u00c5.

The wavelength of electrons can be calculated using the de Broglie relation:\n\n\\[\\lambda = \\frac{h}{p}\\]\n\nwhere \\(h\\) is the Planck constant, and \\(p\\) is the momentum of the electrons. The momentum of the electrons can be related to the kinetic energy \\(E\\) by:\n\n\\[p = \\sqrt{2mE}\\]\n\nwhere \\(m\\) is the mass of an electron. The kinetic energy \\(E\\) can be related to the acceleration potential \\(V\\) by:\n\n\\[E = eV\\]\n\nwhere \\(e\\) is the charge of an electron.

The surface concentration of chromium is maintained at 100%, and we need to find the time required to achieve a Cr concentration of 1.8% at a depth of 0.002 cm below the steel surface.\nStep 2:  To solve this problem, we can use the equation for diffusion with a constant surface concentration.

We need to find the time \\(t\\) required to achieve this concentration.\n\nStep 4:  First, we need to convert the given temperature from Celsius to Kelvin: \\(T=980^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}+273=1253 \\mathrm{~K}\\).\n\nStep 5:  Then, we can use the Arrhenius equation to find the diffusion coefficient \\(D\\) at the given temperature:\n\\[D=D_{o} \\exp \\left(-\\frac{E_{A}}{R T}\\right)\\]\nwhere:\n- \\(D_{o}\\) is the pre-exponential factor,\n- \\(E_{A}\\) is the activation energy,\n- \\(R\\) is the gas constant,\n- \\(T\\) is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nStep 6:  Plugging in the given values, we get:\n\\[D=0.54 \\exp \\left(-\\frac{286 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}}{8.314 \\mathrm{~J} / \\mathrm{mol} \\cdot \\mathrm{K} \\cdot 1253 \\mathrm{~K}}\\right)\\]\n\nStep 7:  Calculating the exponent:\n\\[-\\frac{286 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}}{8.314 \\mathrm{~J} / \\mathrm{mol} \\cdot \\mathrm{K} \\cdot 1253 \\mathrm{~K}}=-\\frac{286 \\times 10^{3} \\mathrm{~J} / \\mathrm{mol}}{8.314 \\mathrm{~J} / \\mathrm{mol} \\cdot 1253 \\mathrm{~K}}=-\\frac{286 \\times 10^{3}}{8.314 \\times 1253}=-\\frac{286 \\times 10^{3}}{10400.42}=-27.55\\]\n\nStep 8:  Therefore, the diffusion coefficient is:\n\\[D=0.54 \\exp (-27.55) \\approx 0.54 \\times 1.1 \\times 10^{-12} \\approx 5.94 \\times 10^{-13} \\mathrm{~cm}^{2} / \\mathrm{s}\\]\n\nStep 9:  Now, we can use the equation for diffusion with a constant surface concentration to find the time \\(t\\). The equation is:\n\\[C(x, t)=C_{s}\\left(1-\\mathrm{erf}\\left(\\frac{x}{2 \\sqrt{Dt}}\\right)\\right)\\]\n\nStep 10:  We are given that \\(C(x, t)=0.018\\), \\(C_{s}=1\\), \\(x=0.002 \\mathrm{~cm}\\), and \\(D=5.94 \\times 10^{-13} \\mathrm{~cm}^{2} / \\mathrm{s}\\). We need to solve for \\(t\\).\n\nStep 11:  Plugging in the values, we get:\n\\[0.018=1-\\mathrm{erf}\\left(\\frac{0.002}{2 \\sqrt{5.94 \\times 10^{-13} t}}\\right)\\]\n\nStep 12:  Rearranging the equation:\n\\[\\mathrm{erf}\\left(\\frac{0.002}{2 \\sqrt{5.94 \\times 10^{-13} t}}\\right)=1-0.018=0.982\\]\n\nStep 13:  Therefore, we need to find the value of \\(t\\) such that:\n\\[\\mathrm{erf}\\left(\\frac{0.002}{2 \\sqrt{5.94 \\times 10^{-13} t}}\\right)=0.982\\]\n\nStep 14:  To solve this equation, we can use the inverse error function, denoted as \\(\\mathrm{erf}^{-1}\\). Therefore, we have:\n\\[\\frac{0.002}{2 \\sqrt{5.94 \\times 10^{-13} t}}=\\mathrm{erf}^{-1}(0.982)\\]\n\nStep 15:  Let's denote the argument of the inverse error function as \\(z\\):\n\\[z=\\mathrm{erf}^{-1}(0.982)\\]\n\nStep 16:  Therefore, we have:\n\\[\\frac{0.002}{2 \\sqrt{5.94 \\times 10^{-13} t}}=z\\]\n\nStep 17:  Solving for \\(t\\), we get:\n\\[t=\\frac{(0.002)^{2}}{4 \\cdot 5.94 \\times 10^{-13} \\cdot z^{2}}\\]\n\nStep 18:  Therefore, we need to find the value of \\(z\\) such that:\n\\[z=\\mathrm{erf}^{-1}(0.982)\\]\n\nStep 19:  Using a calculator or a table of error functions, we can find that:\n\\[\\mathrm{erf}^{-1}(0.982) \\approx 1.2\\]\n\nStep 20:  Therefore, substituting this value into the equation for \\(t\\), we get:\n\\[t=\\frac{(0.002)^{2}}{4 \\cdot 5.94 \\times 10^{-13} \\cdot (1.2)^{2}}\\]\n\nStep 21:  Calculating the numerator:\n\\[(0.002)^{2}=4 \\times 10^{-6}\\]\n\nStep 22:  Calculating the denominator:\n\\[4 \\cdot 5.94 \\times 10^{-13} \\cdot (1.2)^{2}=4 \\cdot 5.94 \\times 10^{-13} \\cdot 1.44=27.0592 \\times 10^{-13}\\]\n\nStep 23:  Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\\[t=\\frac{4 \\times 10^{-6}}{27.0592 \\times 10^{-13}}\\]\n\nStep 24:  Dividing the numerator by the denominator:\n\\[t=\\frac{4 \\times 10^{-6}}{27.0592 \\times 10^{-13}}=\\frac{4}{27.0592} \\times 10^{-6+13}=0.1477 \\times 10^{7}=1477 \\mathrm{~s}\\]\n\nStep 25:  Therefore, the time required to achieve a Cr concentration of 1.8% at a depth of 0.002 cm below the steel surface is approximately 1477 seconds.\n\nStep 26:  To convert this to days, we divide by the number of seconds in a day:\n\\[1477 \\mathrm{~s} \\approx \\frac{1477}{86400} \\approx 0.0171 \\mathrm{~days}\\]\n\nStep 27:  Rounding to 1 decimal place, the time required is approximately 0.2 days.\n\nStep 28:  Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{0.2}",

  "Step 1: First, let's recall the formula for calculating the vacancy fraction in a material. The vacancy fraction is given by the equation:\n\n\\[ n = N \\exp \\left( -\\frac{\\Delta H_V}{k_B T} + \\frac{S_V}{k_B} \\right) \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( n \\) is the vacancy fraction,\n- \\( N \\) is the number of lattice sites,\n- \\( \\Delta H_V \\) is the enthalpy of vacancy formation,\n- \\( k_B \\) is the Boltzmann constant,\n- \\( T \\) is the temperature in Kelvin,\n- \\( S_V \\) is the entropy of vacancy formation.\n\nHowever, the problem mentions an entropic prefactor, A, which is related to the entropy of vacancy formation. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n\\[ n = N A \\exp \\left( -\\frac{\\Delta H_V}{k_B T} \\right) \\]\n\nGiven that the enthalpy of vacancy formation, \\( \\Delta H_V \\), is 1.03 eV, the entropic prefactor, A, is 1.1, and the temperature is 20\u00b0C (293 K).\n\nStep 2: First, we need to convert the enthalpy of vacancy formation from eV to Joules. The conversion factor is 1 eV = 1.60217662 \u00d7 10^-19 J. Therefore:\n\n\\[ \\Delta H_V = 1.03 \\text{ eV} \\times 1.60217662 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J/eV} = 1.653 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J} \\]\n\nStep 3: Next, we need to calculate the vacancy fraction using the given formula.

However, the problem asks for the vacancy fraction in cm^-3. Therefore, we need to express N in terms of the number of atoms per unit volume. The number of atoms per unit volume is given by the density of the material. The density of copper is approximately 8.96 g/cm^3. The atomic mass of copper is 63.55 g/mol. Therefore:\n\n\\[ N = \\frac{\\text{density} \\times \\text{Avogadro's number}}{\\text{atomic mass}} \\]\n\n\\[ N = \\frac{8.96 \\text{ g/cm}^3 \\times 6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\text{ mol}^{-1}}{63.55 \\text{ g/mol}} = 8.49 \\times 10^{22} \\text{ cm}^{-3} \\]\n\nStep 6: Therefore, substituting N into the equation:\n\n\\[ n = 8.49 \\times 10^{22} \\text{ cm}^{-3} \\times 1.1 \\times \\exp(-40.8) \\]\n\nStep 7: Let's compute the exponential term:\n\n\\[ \\exp(-40.8) = 1.2 \\times 10^{-18} \\]\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[ n = 8.49 \\times 10^{22} \\text{ cm}^{-3} \\times 1.1 \\times 1.2 \\times 10^{-18} \\text{ cm}^3 \\]\n\nStep 8: Multiplying the numbers:\n\n\\[ n = 8.49 \\times 10^{22} \\times 1.32 \\times 10^{-18} = 1.12 \\times 10^5 \\text{ cm}^{-3} \\]\n\nTherefore, the vacancy fraction is 1.12 \u00d7 10^5 cm^-3.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{1.12 \u00d7 10^5}",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to calculate the planar packing fraction of the (110) plane in aluminum at 300 K. The planar packing fraction is the ratio of the area occupied by atoms in a given plane to the total area of the plane. First, we need to determine the lattice parameters and the atomic positions in the (110) plane.\n\nStep 2:  Aluminum has a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure. The lattice parameter (a) can be related to the atomic radius (r) by the equation a = 2\u221a2r. However, since the problem doesn't provide the atomic radius, we need to use the given temperature (300 K) to find the lattice parameter. For FCC metals, the lattice parameter can be calculated using the equation a = \u221a3d, where d is the interplanar spacing. Alternatively, we can use the equation a = 2r\u221a2, but since we don't have the atomic radius, we'll use the first method.\n\nStep 3:  The interplanar spacing (d) for the (110) plane can be calculated using the equation d = a / \u221a(h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2), where h, k, and l are the Miller indices of the plane. For the (110) plane, h = 1, k = 1, and l = 0. Therefore, d = a / \u221a(1\u00b2 + 1\u00b2 + 0\u00b2) = a / \u221a2.\n\nStep 4:  The lattice parameter (a) can be calculated using the equation a = \u221a3d. Substituting d = a / \u221a2, we get a = \u221a3(a / \u221a2) = a\u221a3 / \u221a2 = a\u221a6 / 2. Therefore, a = 2d / \u221a6.\n\nStep 5:  Alternatively, we can use the equation a = \u221a3d. Since d = a / \u221a2, we have a = \u221a3(a / \u221a2) = a\u221a3 / \u221a2 = a\u221a6 / 2. Therefore, a = 2d / \u221a6.\n\nStep 6:  However, since we don't have the atomic radius, we can use the equation a = \u221a3d. Therefore, d = a / \u221a3. Substituting d = a / \u221a3 into the equation a = \u221a3d, we get a = \u221a3(a / \u221a3) = a. Therefore, a = \u221a3d.\n\nStep 7:  Therefore, the lattice parameter (a) is equal to \u221a3d. Therefore, d = a / \u221a3.\n\nStep 8:  The interplanar spacing (d) for the (110) plane is d = a / \u221a2.\n\nStep 9:  Therefore, d = a / \u221a2 = a\u221a2 / 2.\n\nStep 10:  Therefore, d = a\u221a2

To do this, we first need to compute the energy in joules per ion pair, then convert it to kJ/mole. The formula for the energy per ion pair is:\n\n\\[ \\Delta E_{\\text{ion pair}} = \\frac{9}{8} \\cdot \\frac{Z^2 \\cdot e^2}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0 r_0} \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{n} \\right) \\]\n\nThen, to convert to kJ/mole, we multiply by Avogadro's number (6.022 \\(\\times 10^{23}\\) ions/mole) and divide by 1000 (since 1 kJ = 1000 J).\n\nStep 3: Let's plug in the given values and constants into the formula.\n\nFirst, let's compute the term:\n\n\\[ \\frac{9}{8} \\cdot \\frac{1^2 \\cdot (1.602 \\times 10^{-19})^2}{4 \\pi (8.854 \\times 10^{-12}) r_0} \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{8.7} \\right) \\]\n\nStep 4: Let's calculate the term inside the parentheses first:\n\n\\[ 1 - \\frac{1}{8.7} = 1 - 0.1149 = 0.8851 \\]\n\nStep 5: Next, compute the term:\n\n\\[ \\frac{9}{8} \\cdot \\frac{1^2 \\cdot (1.602 \\times 10^{-19})^2}{4 \\pi (8.854 \\times 10^{-12}) r_0} \\]\n\nStep 6: Let's compute the denominator first:\n\n\\[ 4 \\pi (8.854 \\times 10^{-12}) r_0 = 4 \\pi (8.854 \\times 10^{-12}) r_0 \\]\n\nStep 7: Let's assume that the equilibrium distance \\( r_0 \\) is given in meters.

The lattice constant is related to the equilibrium distance by:\n\n\\[ r_0 = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}} \\]\n\nwhere \\( a \\) is the lattice constant.\n\nStep 9: Let's convert the lattice constant from \u00c5 to meters:\n\n\\[ a = 2.31 \\text{ \u00c5} = 2.31 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m} \\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ r_0 = \\frac{2.31 \\times 10^{-10}}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{2.31 \\times 10^{-10}}{1.414} = 1.633 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m} \\]\n\nStep 10: Now that we have \\( r_0 \\), we can plug it into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\frac{9}{8} \\cdot \\frac{1^2 \\cdot (1.602 \\times 10^{-19})^2}{4 \\pi (8.854 \\times 10^{-12}) (1.633 \\times 10^{-10})} \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{8.7} \\right) \\]\n\nStep 11: Let's compute the term:\n\n\\[ \\frac{9}{8} \\cdot \\frac{1^2 \\cdot (1.602 \\times 10^{-19})^2}{4 \\pi (8.854 \\times 10^{-12}) (1.633 \\times 10^{-10})} \\]\n\nStep 12: First, compute the numerator:\n\n\\[ 1^2 \\cdot (1.602 \\times 10^{-19})^2 = (1.602 \\times 10^{-19})^2 = 2.568 \\times 10^{-38} \\]\n\nStep 13: Then, compute the denominator:\n\n\\[ 4 \\pi (8.854 \\times 10^{-12}) (1.633 \\times 10^{-10}) = 4 \\pi (8.854 \\times 10^{-12}) (1.633 \\times 10^{-10}) = 4 \\pi (1.443 \\times 10^{-21}) = 1.819 \\times 10^{-20} \\]\n\nStep 14: Then,\n\n\\[ \\frac{9}{8} \\cdot \\frac{2.568 \\times 10^{-38}}{1.819 \\times 10^{-20}} = \\frac{9}{8} \\cdot 1.414 \\times 10^{-18} = 1.5 \\times 1.414 \\times 10^{-18} = 2.121 \\times 10^{-18} \\]\n\nStep 15: Multiply by the term \\( 1 - \\frac{1}{8.7} = 0.8851 \\):\n\n\\[ 2.121 \\times 10^{-18} \\times 0.8851 = 1.873 \\times 10^{-18} \\]\n\nStep 16: Convert to kJ/mole:\n\n\\[ \\Delta E_{\\text{cryst}} = 1.873 \\times 10^{-18} \\text{ J/ion pair} \\times 6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\text{ ions/mole} \\times \\frac{1}{1000} \\text{ kJ/J} \\]\n\nStep 17: Let's compute the term:\n\n\\[ 1.873 \\times 10^{-18} \\times 6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\times \\frac{1}{1000} = 1.873 \\times 6.022 \\times 10^{5} \\times 10^{-3} = 1.127 \\times 10^{3} \\text{ kJ/mole} \\]\n\nStep 18: Therefore, the crystal energy is approximately 1127 kJ/mole.\n\nStep 19: Rounding to 1 decimal place, the final answer is 1127 kJ/mole.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{1127}",
  "Step 1: To calculate the molecular weight of NaHCO3, we need to sum the atomic weights of all the atoms in the molecule.\n\nStep 2: The molecular formula is NaHCO3. Let's break it down:\n\n- Na (Sodium): atomic weight = 22.99 g/mol\n- H (Hydrogen): atomic weight = 1.01 g/mol\n- C (Carbon): atomic weight = 12.01 g/mol\n- O (Oxygen): atomic weight = 16.00 g/mol\n\nStep 3: Since there is one atom of each element except for oxygen, which has three atoms. So, the total weight is:\n\n- Na: 22.99 g/mol\n- H: 1.01 g/mol\n- C: 12.01 g/mol\n- O: 3 * 16.00 g/mol = 48.00 g/mol\n\nStep 4: Add all the weights together:\n\n22.99 + 1.01 + 12.01 + 48.00 = 84.01 g/mol\n\nStep 5: Round the result to two decimal places: 84.01 g/mol\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of NaHCO3 is 84.01 g/mol.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{84.01}",
  "Step 1:  To solve for the enthalpy of vacancy formation, \u0394Hv, we can use the formula derived from the vacancy fraction equation:\n\\[ \\frac{n_{v}}{N} = \\exp \\left( -\\frac{\\Delta H_{v}}{k_{B} T} \\right) \\]\nwhere \\( n_{v} \\) is the number of vacancies, \\( N \\) is the total number of atoms, \\( k_{B} \\) is the Boltzmann constant, and \\( T \\) is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nStep 2:  We are given two sets of vacancy fractions at different temperatures: at 12340\u00b0C (which is 12340 + 273.15 = 12313.15 K) and at the melting point (which is not explicitly given, but we can assume it's the melting point of iridium, which is 2467\u00b0C or 2740 K). The vacancy fractions are 3.091 \u00d7 10^{-5} and 5.26 \u00d7 10^{-3}, respectively.\n\nStep 3:  We can set up two equations using the formula above for each temperature:\n\\[ 3.091 \\times 10^{-5} = \\exp \\left( -\\frac{\\Delta H_{v}}{k_{B} \\times 12313.15} \\right) \\]\n\\[ 5.26 \\times 10^{-3} = \\exp \\left( -\\frac{\\Delta H_{v}}{k_{B} \\times 2740} \\right) \\]\n\nStep 4:  Let's denote the first equation as equation (1) and the second as equation (2). We can solve these equations simultaneously to find \u0394Hv.\n\nStep 5:  First, let's rearrange both equations to isolate the exponential term:\n\\[ \\exp \\left( -\\frac{\\Delta H_{v}}{k_{B} \\times 12313.15} \\right) = 3.091 \\times 10^{-5} \\]\n\\[ \\exp \\left( -\\frac{\\Delta H_{v}}{k_{B} \\times 2740} \\right) = 5.26 \\times 10^{-3} \\]\n\nStep 6:  Taking the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides of each equation to solve for \u0394Hv:\n\\[ -\\frac{\\Delta H_{v}}{k_{B} \\times 12313.15} = \\ln(3.091 \\times 10^{-5}) \\]\n\\[ -\\frac{\\Delta H_{v}}{k_{B} \\times 2740} = \\ln(5.26 \\times 10^{-3}) \\]\n\nStep 7:  Let's denote the left-hand side of the first equation as LHS1 and the second as LHS2. Then:\n\\[ LHS1 = -\\frac{\\Delta H_{v}}{k_{B} \\times 12313.15} = \\ln(3.091 \\times 10^{-5}) \\]\n\\[ LHS2 = -\\frac{\\Delta H_{v}}{k_{B} \\times 2740} = \\ln(5.26 \\times 10^{-3}) \\]\n\nStep 8:  We can set up a system of equations:\n\\[ LHS1 = LHS2 \\]\n\\[ -\\frac{\\Delta H_{v}}{k_{B} \\times 12313.15} = -\\frac{\\Delta H_{v}}{k_{B} \\times 2740} \\]\n\nStep 9:  Multiplying both sides by \\( k_{B} \\times 12313.15 \\) to eliminate the denominator:\n\\[ -\\Delta H_{v} = -\\frac{\\Delta H_{v} \\times 12313.15}{2740} \\]\n\nStep 10:  Dividing both sides by \\( -\\Delta H_{v} \\) (assuming \u0394Hv is not zero):\n\\[ 1 = \\frac{12313.15}{2740} \\]\n\nStep 11:  Therefore, the ratio of the two temperatures is equal to 1, which is not true.

  "To solve this problem, we need to find the temperature at which the energy gap of germanium (Ge) is equal to the thermal energy (3/2 kT), where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature in Kelvin. At this temperature, electron-hole pairs start to be produced, making Ge conductive.\n\nFirst, let's recall that the energy gap (Eg) for germanium is approximately 0.67 eV. We need to convert this to Joules, since the Boltzmann constant is in J/K.\n\n1 eV = 1.602 \u00d7 10^(-19) J\n\nSo, Eg = 0.67 eV \u00d7 1.602 \u00d7 10^(-19) J/eV = 1.0734 \u00d7 10^(-19) J\n\nNow, we can set up the equation:\n\nEg = 3/2 kT\n\nwhere k is the Boltzmann constant, approximately 1.38 \u00d7 10^(-23) J/K.\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for T:\n\nT = 2Eg / (3k)\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\nT = 2 \u00d7 1.0734 \u00d7 10^(-19) J / (3 \u00d7 1.38 \u00d7 10^(-23) J/K)\n\nT = 2 \u00d7 1.0734 \u00d7 10^(-19) / (4.14 \u00d7 10^(-23))\n\nT = 0.0518 \u00d7 10^4 K\n\nT \u2248 518 K\n\nTo convert Kelvin to Celsius:\n\nT (\u00b0C) = T (K) - 273.15\n\nT (\u00b0C) = 518 K - 273.15 = 244.85 \u00b0C\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the temperature is approximately 245 \u00b0C.\n\nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{2.5 \u00d7 10^2}",
  "Step 1: Understand the problem and identify the relevant equation.\nThe problem involves a first-order chemical reaction with given activation energy (E_A) and pre-exponential factor (A). We need to find the rate constant (k) at a temperature (T) of 750\u00b0C. The relevant equation for this is the Arrhenius equation, which is k = Ae^(-E_A/RT), where R is the gas constant.\n\nStep 2: Convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin.\nFirst, we need to convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin. The formula for this is T (in Kelvin) = T (in Celsius) + 273.15. Therefore, T = 750 + 273.15 = 1023.15 K.\n\nStep 3: Plug in the given values into the Arrhenius equation.\nNow, we can plug in the given values into the Arrhenius equation: k = (1.7 \u00d7 10^14 s^-1) * e^(-250 kJ/mol / (8.314 J/mol*K * 1023.15 K)).\n\nStep 4: Perform the calculation.\nFirst, calculate the exponent: -250 kJ/mol / (8.314 J/mol*K * 1023.15 K) = -250,000 J/mol / (8,471.5 J/mol) = -29.5. Then, take the exponential: e^(-29.5) \u2248 1.0 \u00d7 10^(-12.5).\n\nStep 5: Multiply the pre-exponential factor by the exponential result.\nNow, multiply the pre-exponential factor (1.7 \u00d7 10^14 s^-1) by the exponential result (1.0 \u00d7 10^(-12.5)). This gives (1.7 \u00d7 10^14) * (1.0 \u00d7 10^(-12.5)) = 1.7 \u00d7 10^14 * 1.0 \u00d7 10^(-12.5) = 1.7 \u00d7 10^(14 - 12.5) = 1.7 \u00d7 10^1.5 \u2248 1.7 \u00d7 10^1.5 \u2248 1.7 \u00d7 3.162 \u2248 5.3742.\n\nStep 6: Round the result to 1 decimal place.\nFinally, round the result to 1 decimal place. Therefore, the rate constant k \u2248 5.4 s^-1.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{5.4}",
  "To solve this problem, we need to determine the planar packing density of a cubic metal with a lattice parameter of 0.77 \u00c5 that exhibits plastic deformation by slip along <111> directions. The densest family of planes for a cubic metal is typically the {111} planes. Therefore, we need to calculate the number of atoms per unit area in the (111) plane.\n\nFirst, let's recall the formula for the planar packing density:\n\nPlanar packing density = Number of atoms per unit area = (Number of atoms per unit cell) \u00d7 (Area of the unit cell per atom)\n\nFor a cubic metal, the lattice parameter is the edge length of the unit cell. The number of atoms per unit cell can be determined from the lattice parameter and the number of atoms in the unit cell.\n\nFor a cubic metal with a lattice parameter of 0.77 \u00c5, the number of atoms per unit cell is typically 4 (one at each corner and one at the center of each face). However, since the metal exhibits plastic deformation by slip along <111> directions, the number of atoms per unit cell might be different. Let's assume that the metal has a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure, which is common for cubic metals. In an FCC structure, there are 4 atoms per unit cell.\n\nThe area of the unit cell per atom can be calculated as follows:\n\nThe area of the unit cell is the square of the lattice parameter (a\u00b2). The area per atom is the area of the unit cell divided by the number of atoms per unit cell.\n\nArea per atom = a\u00b2 / 4\n\nSubstituting the lattice parameter (0.77 \u00c5):\n\nArea per atom = (0.77 \u00c5)\u00b2 / 4 = 0.5929 \u00c5\u00b2 / 4 = 0.148225 \u00c5\u00b2\n\nTo convert this to m\u00b2, we need to convert \u00c5 to m:\n\n1 \u00c5 = 10\u207b\u00b9\u2070 m\n\nTherefore:\n\nArea per atom = 0.148225 \u00c5\u00b2 \u00d7 (10\u207b\u00b9\u2070 m / 1 \u00c5)\u00b2 = 0.148225 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2079 m\u00b2\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of atoms per unit area in the (111) plane:\n\nThe (111) plane is a hexagonal plane with a lattice parameter of a\u221a3/2. The area of the (111) plane per atom is:\n\nArea per atom in (111) plane = (a\u221a3/2)\u00b2 / 2\n\nSubstituting the lattice parameter (0.77 \u00c5):\n\nArea per atom in (111) plane = (0.77 \u00c5)\u00b2 \u00d7 (\u221a3/2)\u00b2 / 2 = 0.5929 \u00c5\u00b2 \u00d7 3/4 / 2 = 0.5929 \u00d7 3/8 \u00c5\u00b2 = 0.222675 \u00c5\u00b2\n\nTo convert this to m\u00b2:\n\nArea per atom in (111) plane = 0.222675 \u00c5\u00b2 \u00d7 (10\u207b\u00b9\u2070 m / 1 \u00c5)\u00b2 = 0.222675 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2079 m\u00b2\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of atoms per unit area in the (111) plane:\n\nNumber of atoms per unit area = (Number of atoms per unit cell) / (Area per atom in (111) plane)\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\nNumber of atoms per unit area = 4 / (0.222675 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2079 m\u00b2)\n\nTo simplify, let's convert the denominator to a decimal:\n\n0.222675 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2079 m\u00b2 = 2.22675 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b2\u00b2 m\u00b2\n\nTherefore:\n\nNumber of atoms per unit area = 4 / (2.22675 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b2\u00b2 m\u00b2) = 1.793 \u00d7 10\u00b2\u00b9 m\u207b\u00b2\n\nTo express this as n \u00d7 10^x, where n is to 2 decimal places:\n\nn = 1.79\n\nx = 21\n\nTherefore, the planar packing density is 1.79 \u00d7 10\u00b2\u00b9 m\u207b\u00b2.\n\nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{1.79 \u00d7 10\u00b2\u00b9}",

  "To find the maximum wavelength of radiation capable of second order diffraction in platinum (Pt), we need to use the diffraction grating equation. The diffraction grating equation is given by:\n\n\\[d \\sin(\\theta) = m \\lambda\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(d\\) is the spacing between the grating lines,\n- \\(\\theta\\) is the angle of diffraction,\n- \\(m\\) is the order of diffraction (in this case, \\(m = 2\\) for second order),\n- \\(\\lambda\\) is the wavelength of the radiation.\n\nFor a diffraction grating, the spacing between the grating lines is given by:\n\n\\[d = \\frac{1}{N}\\]\n\nwhere \\(N\\) is the number of grating lines per unit length. However, for a typical diffraction grating, the spacing is usually given in terms of the number of lines per unit length, so we can use the formula:\n\n\\[d = \\frac{1}{N}\\]\n\nwhere \\(N\\) is the number of lines per unit length.\n\nHowever, in the case of a crystal, like platinum, the spacing between the atoms (or planes) can be used as the grating spacing. The spacing between the atoms in a crystal is given by the interplanar spacing, which can be calculated using the Bragg equation:\n\n\\[2d \\sin(\\theta) = n \\lambda\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(d\\) is the interplanar spacing,\n- \\(\\theta\\) is the angle of diffraction,\n- \\(n\\) is the order of diffraction,\n- \\(\\lambda\\) is the wavelength of the radiation.\n\nFor platinum, we need to find the interplanar spacing for a specific plane. Let's assume we are using the (111) plane, which is a common plane for many metals. The interplanar spacing for the (111) plane in platinum can be calculated using the lattice parameter.\n\nThe lattice parameter for platinum is approximately 3.92 \u00c5. The interplanar spacing for the (111) plane can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[d_{hkl} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2}}\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(a\\) is the lattice parameter,\n- \\(h\\), \\(k\\), \\(l\\) are the Miller indices of the plane.\n\nFor the (111) plane, \\(h = 1\\), \\(k = 1\\), \\(l = 1\\). Plugging in the values, we get:\n\n\\[d_{111} = \\frac{3.92 \\text{ \u00c5}}{\\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2}} = \\frac{3.92 \\text{ \u00c5}}{\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 2.24 \\text{ \u00c5}\\]\n\nConverting this to meters:\n\n\\[d_{111} \\approx 2.24 \\text{ \u00c5} \\times \\frac{10^{-10} \\text{ m}}{1 \\text{ \u00c5}} \\approx 2.24 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m}\\]\n\nNow, we can use the diffraction grating equation:\n\n\\[d \\sin(\\theta) = m \\lambda\\]\n\nRearranging to solve for \\(\\lambda\\):\n\n\\[\\lambda = \\frac{d \\sin(\\theta)}{m}\\]\n\nSince we want the maximum wavelength, we need to find the maximum angle \\(\\theta\\) that satisfies the equation. The maximum angle is 90 degrees, so \\(\\sin(\\theta) = 1\\). Plugging in the values:\n\n\\[\\lambda = \\frac{2.24 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m} \\times 1}{2} = 1.12 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m}\\]\n\nTherefore, the maximum wavelength of radiation capable of second order diffraction in platinum is approximately \\(1.12 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m}\\).\n\nTo express this in the required format \\(n \\times 10^x\\), where \\(n\\) is to 2 decimal places:\n\n\\[1.12

  "Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem asks for the activation energy of a process that increases by a factor of three when the temperature is increased from room temperature (20\u00b0C) to 40\u00b0C. We need to find this activation energy in kJ/mole, rounded to 1 decimal place.\n\nStep 2: Recall the Arrhenius equation\nThe Arrhenius equation relates the rate constant (k) of a process to the activation energy (Ea) and temperature (T) in Kelvin:\n\\[ k = Ae^{-\\frac{E_{a}}{RT}} \\]\nwhere A is a pre-exponential factor, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nStep 3: Express the rate constant at two temperatures\nLet's denote the rate constant at 20\u00b0C (293 K) as k1 and at 40\u00b0C (313 K) as k2. The problem states that k2 is three times k1, so:\n\\[ k_{2} = 3k_{1} \\]\n\nStep 4: Use the Arrhenius equation to relate the two rate constants\nSubstitute the Arrhenius equation for k1 and k2:\n\\[ k_{1} = Ae^{-\\frac{E_{a}}{RT_{1}}} \\]\n\\[ k_{2} = Ae^{-\\frac{E_{a}}{RT_{2}}} \\]\nSince k2 = 3k1, we can write:\n\\[ 3k_{1} = k_{2} = Ae^{-\\frac{E_{a}}{RT_{2}}} \\]\nTherefore, the ratio of k2 to k1 is:\n\\[ \\frac{k_{2}}{k_{1}} = 3 = e^{-\\frac{E_{a}}{R} \\left( \\frac{1}{T_{2}} - \\frac{1}{T_{1}} \\right)} \\]\n\nStep 5: Solve for activation energy (Ea)\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\\[ \\ln(3) = -\\frac{E_{a}}{R} \\left( \\frac{1}{T_{2}} - \\frac{1}{T_{1}} \\right) \\]\nTherefore, the activation energy Ea is:\n\\[ E_{a} = -R \\left( \\frac{1}{T_{2}} - \\frac{1}{T_{1}} \\right)^{-1} \\ln(3) \\]\n\nStep 6: Plug in the values\nGiven T1 = 293 K and T2 = 313 K, and R = 8.314 J/(mol*K). First, compute the term inside the parentheses:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{T_{2}} - \\frac{1}{T_{1}} = \\frac{1}{313} - \\frac{1}{293} \\]\n\\[ = \\frac{293 - 313}{293 \\times 313} \\]\n\\[ = \\frac{-20}{91739} \\]\n\\[ = -\\frac{20}{91739} \\]\n\\[ = -2.18 \\times 10^{-5} \\]\n\nStep 7: Compute the activation energy\n\\[ E_{a} = -8.314 \\times \\left( -2.18 \\times 10^{-5} \\right)^{-1} \\ln(3) \\]\n\\[ =

  "To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps below:\n\n1. Write the balanced chemical equation for the combustion of ethane (C2H6) to form carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O).\n2. Calculate the number of moles of oxygen required to completely convert 1 mole of C2H6.\n3. Convert the number of moles of oxygen to kilograms.\n\nStep 1: Write the balanced chemical equation for the combustion of ethane (C2H6) to form carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O).\n\nThe balanced chemical equation is:\n\nC2H6 + 3.5O2 \u2192 2CO2 + 3H2O\n\nFrom this equation, we can see that 1 mole of C2H6 requires 3.5 moles of O2 to be completely converted into CO2 and H2O.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the number of moles of oxygen required to completely convert 1 mole of C2H6.\n\nSince 1 mole of C2H6 requires 3.5 moles of O2, the number of moles of oxygen required is 3.5 moles.\n\nStep 3: Convert the number of moles of oxygen to kilograms.\n\nThe molar mass of oxygen (O2) is 32 g/mol.

  "Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem involves determining the age of whiskey suspected to be \"moonshine\" based on its activity level of naturally occurring tritium (T), a radioactive hydrogen isotope with a half-life of 12.5 years. The activity is found to be 6% of that encountered in fresh bourbon. We need to find the age of the whiskey in years.\n\nStep 2: Recall the formula for radioactive decay\nThe formula for radioactive decay is given by:\n\n\\[ A(t) = A_0 \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^{t/T_{1/2}} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( A(t) \\) is the activity at time \\( t \\),\n- \\( A_0 \\) is the initial activity,\n- \\( t \\) is the time elapsed,\n- \\( T_{1/2} \\) is the half-life of the radioactive substance.\n\nStep 3: Determine the initial activity and the activity at time t\nGiven that the activity in the whiskey is 6% of that in fresh bourbon, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ A(t) = 0.06 \\times A_0 \\]\n\nSince the activity decreases over time due to radioactive decay, we can substitute the formula for \\( A(t) \\) from step 2:\n\n\\[ 0.06 \\times A_0 = A_0 \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^{t/12.5} \\]\n\nStep 4: Solve for t\nDivide both sides by \\( A_0 \\):\n\n\\[ 0.06 = \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^{t/12.5} \\]\n\nTake the logarithm of both sides to solve for t. We can use logarithms to solve for t:\n\n\\[ \\log(0.06) = \\frac{t}{12.5} \\times \\log\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\]\n\nStep 5: Calculate the logarithms and solve for t\nFirst, compute the logarithms:\n\n\\[ \\log(0.06) \\approx -1.222 \\]\n\n\\[ \\log\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) = -0.301 \\]\n\nSubstitute these values into the equation:\n\n\\[ -1.222 = \\frac{t}{12.5} \\times -0.301 \\]\n\nStep 6: Solve for t\nDivide both sides by -0.301:\n\n\\[ \\frac{-1.222}{-0.301} = \\frac{t}{12.5} \\]\n\n\\[ 4.06 = \\frac{t}{12.5} \\]\n\nMultiply both sides by 12.5:\n\n\\[ t = 4.06 \\times 12.5 \\]\n\nStep 7: Calculate t\nCompute the product:\n\n\\[ t = 4.06 \\times 12.5 = 50.75 \\]\n\nTherefore, the age of the whiskey is approximately 50.75 years.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{50.75}",

  "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the rate constant at 600\u00b0C and then use it to find the fraction of the reaction completed in 10 minutes.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the rate constant at 600\u00b0C.\n\nFirst, we need to convert 600\u00b0C to Kelvin: T = 600 + 273.15 = 873.15 K.\n\nThen, we can use the Arrhenius equation:\n\nk = Ae^(-Ea/RT)\n\nwhere k is the rate constant, A is the pre-exponential factor, Ea is the activation energy, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nGiven values:\n\nA = 1.7 \u00d7 10^14 s^-1\nEa = 250 kJ/mol = 2.5 \u00d7 10^5 J/mol\nR = 8.31 \u00d7 10^3 J/(mol\u00b7K)\nT = 873.15 K\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nk = 1.7 \u00d7 10^14 \u00d7 e^(-2.5 \u00d7 10^5 / (8.31 \u00d7 10^3 \u00d7 873.15))\n\nFirst, calculate the exponent:\n\n-2.5 \u00d7 10^5 / (8.31 \u00d7 10^3 \u00d7 873.15) = -2.5 \u00d7 10^5 / (7.25 \u00d7 10^6) = -0.344\n\nThen, take the exponential:\n\ne^(-0.344) \u2248 0.709\n\nSo, k \u2248 1.7 \u00d7 10^14 \u00d7 0.709 \u2248 1.21 \u00d7 10^14 s^-1\n\nTherefore, the rate constant at 600\u00b0C is approximately 1.21 \u00d7 10^14 s^-1.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the fraction of the reaction completed in 10 minutes.\n\nThe fraction of the reaction completed can be calculated using the integrated rate law for a first-order reaction:\n\nln([A]t/[A]0) = -kt\n\nwhere [A]t is the concentration at time t, [A]0 is the initial concentration, k is the rate constant, and t is time.\n\nSince we are interested in the fraction of the reaction completed, we can set [A]t = (1 - f)[A]0, where f is the fraction completed.\n\nThen, rearranging the equation:\n\nln((1 - f)) = -kt\n\nTherefore, f = 1 - e^(-kt)\n\nGiven:\n\nk = 1.21 \u00d7 10^14 s^-1\nt = 10 minutes = 600 s\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nf = 1 - e^(-1.21 \u00d7 10^14 \u00d7 600)\n\nFirst, calculate the exponent:\n\n-1.21 \u00d7 10^14 \u00d7 600 = -7.26 \u00d7 10^16\n\nThen, take the exponential:\n\ne^(-7.26 \u00d7 10^16) \u2248 0\n\nSo, f \u2248 1 - 0 = 1\n\nTherefore, the fraction of the reaction completed in 10 minutes at 600\u00b0C is approximately 1, which means the reaction is almost complete.\n\nHowever, this result seems unrealistic. Let's check the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the equation:\n\nf = 1 - e^(-kt)\n\nBut since the exponent is so large, the exponential term is very small, and the fraction f is very close to 1. However, the calculation above shows that the fraction is exactly 1, which is not possible.\n\nLet's recheck the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the equation:\n\nf = 1 - e^(-kt)\n\nBut since the exponent is so large, the exponential term is very small, and the fraction f is very close to 1. However, the calculation above shows that the fraction is exactly 1, which is not possible.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the equation:\n\nf = 1 - e^(-kt)\n\nBut since the exponent is so large, the exponential term is very small, and the fraction f is very close to 1.

  "Problem: Determine the energy gap (in eV) between the electronic states n=7 and n=8 in hydrogen. Please format your answer as n \u00d7 10^x where n is to 1 decimal place.\n\nTo find the energy gap between the electronic states n=7 and n=8 in hydrogen, we need to calculate the energy of each state and then find the difference.\n\nThe energy of an electron in the nth state of hydrogen is given by the formula:\n\nE_n = -13.6 eV / n^2\n\nwhere n is the principal quantum number.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the energy of the n=7 state:\n\nE_7 = -13.6 eV / 7^2\n= -13.6 eV / 49\n= -0.278 eV\n\nNext, let's calculate the energy of the n=8 state:\n\nE_8 = -13.6 eV / 8^2\n= -13.6 eV / 64\n= -0.2125 eV\n\nNow, the energy gap between the two states is the difference between their energies:\n\n\u0394E = E_8 - E_7\n= -0.2125 eV - (-0.278 eV)\n= -0.2125 + 0.278\n= 0.0655 eV\n\nTo format the answer as n \u00d7 10^x where n is to 1 decimal place, we need to express 0.0655 eV in this form.\n\nFirst, let's convert 0.0655 eV to a number between 1 and 10 by multiplying by 10:\n\n0.0655 eV \u00d7 10 = 0.655 eV\n\nNow, 0.655 eV is between 1 and 10, so we can express it as 6.55 \u00d7 10^(-1) eV.\n\nTherefore, the energy gap is 6.5 \u00d7 10^(-1) eV.\n\nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{6.5}",
  "Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem is asking for the maximum age of a sample that can be dated using the decay rate of ${ }^{14} \\mathrm{C}$. The decay rate is given as 15.3 disintegrations per minute per gram of carbon, with an experimental uncertainty of \u00b10.1 disintegrations per minute per gram. The half-life of ${ }^{14} \\mathrm{C}$ is 5730 years.\n\nStep 2: Determine the relevant formula\nThe formula to calculate the age of a sample based on its decay rate is:\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{\\ln(N_0 / N)}{\\lambda} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( t \\) is the age of the sample,\n- \\( N_0 \\) is the initial number of radioactive atoms,\n- \\( N \\) is the current number of radioactive atoms,\n- \\( \\lambda \\) is the decay constant.\n\nHowever, since the decay rate is given as disintegrations per minute per gram, we need to convert it to the decay constant \\( \\lambda \\) first.\n\nStep 3: Convert decay rate to decay constant\nThe decay constant \\( \\lambda \\) is related to the decay rate \\( R \\) by:\n\n\\[ \\lambda = \\frac{R}{N} \\]\n\nHowever, since the decay rate is given per gram of carbon, we need to consider the total number of atoms in a gram of carbon. The number of atoms in a gram of carbon can be calculated using Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10^23 atoms/mol) and the molar mass of carbon (12 g/mol).\n\nTherefore, the number of atoms in a gram of carbon is:\n\n\\[ N = \\frac{6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\text{ atoms/mol}}{12 \\text{ g/mol}} \\times 1 \\text{ g} = 5.023 \\times 10^{21} \\text{ atoms} \\]\n\nSo, the decay constant \\( \\lambda \\) is:\n\n\\[ \\lambda = \\frac{15.3 \\text{ disintegrations/minute}}{5.023 \\times 10^{21} \\text{ atoms}} = 3.05 \\times 10^{-22} \\text{ disintegrations/minute/atom} \\]\n\nHowever, the decay constant is typically expressed in units of 1/time. To convert it to 1/year, we need to multiply by the number of minutes in a year:\n\n\\[ \\lambda = 3.05 \\times 10^{-22} \\text{ disintegrations/minute/atom} \\times \\frac{60 \\text{ minutes}}{1 \\text{ hour}} \\times \\frac{24 \\text{ hours}}{1 \\text{ day}} \\times \\frac{365.25 \\text{ days}}{1 \\text{ year}} = 1.19 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ disintegrations/year/atom} \\]\n\nAlternatively, we can use the half-life formula:\n\n\\[ \\lambda = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{T_{1/2}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{5730 \\text{ years}} = 1.21 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ year}^{-1} \\]\n\nStep 4: Calculate the maximum age\nThe maximum age is the time it takes for the sample to decay to 1/2 of its initial amount. Therefore, we can use the formula:\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\lambda} \\]\n\nSubstituting the value of \\( \\lambda \\) from step 3:\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{1.21 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ year}^{-1}} = 5730 \\text{ years} \\]\n\nHowever, this is the half-life, which is the time it takes for the sample to decay to 1/2 of its initial amount. The maximum age is the time it takes for the sample to decay to 1/2 of its initial amount, which is the same as the half-life.\n\nTherefore, the maximum age of a sample that can be dated is 5730 years.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{5730}",

  "Step 1: Understand the problem and the given information.\nWe are given the ionic radii of Cs+ and Cl- as 1.67 \u00c5 and 1.81 \u00c5, respectively, and the Madelung constant for CsCl as 1.763. We need to calculate the molar crystal energy (\u0394Ecryst) for CsCl.\n\nStep 2: Recall the formula for calculating the crystal energy.\nThe crystal energy can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\u0394Ecryst = -M \u00d7 (Z+ \u00d7 Z- \u00d7 e^2 / (4\u03c0\u03b5\u2080r+ + r-))\n\nwhere M is the Madelung constant, Z+ and Z- are the charges of the cation and anion, e is the elementary charge, \u03b5\u2080 is the vacuum permittivity, and r+ and r- are the ionic radii.\n\nStep 3: Plug in the given values into the formula.\nGiven that M = 1.763, Z+ = 1 (for Cs+), Z- = -1 (for Cl-), e = 1.602 \u00d7 10^-19 C, \u03b5\u2080 = 8.854 \u00d7 10^-12 F/m, r+ = 1.67 \u00c5 = 1.67 \u00d7 10^-10 m, and r- = 1.81 \u00c5 = 1.81 \u00d7 10^-10 m.\n\nStep 4: Perform the calculation.\nFirst, calculate the term (Z+ \u00d7 Z- \u00d7 e^2 / (4\u03c0\u03b5\u2080r+ + r-)).\n\nZ+ \u00d7 Z- = 1 \u00d7 (-1) = -1\n\ne^2 = (1.602 \u00d7 10^-19 C)^2 = 2.57 \u00d7 10^-38 C^2\n\n4\u03c0\u03b5\u2080 = 4 \u00d7 3.14159 \u00d7 8.854 \u00d7 10^-12 F/m = 1.112 \u00d7 10^-10 F/m\n\nr+ + r- = 1.67 \u00d7 10^-10 m + 1.81 \u00d7 10^-10 m = 3.48 \u00d7 10^-10 m\n\nSo, the term is: -1 \u00d7 2.57 \u00d7 10^-38 C^2 / (1.112 \u00d7 10^-10 F/m \u00d7 3.48 \u00d7 10^-10 m) = -1 \u00d7 2.57 \u00d7 10^-38 / (3.87 \u00d7 10^-20) = -6.64 \u00d7 10^1 J/m = 664 J/m\n\nThen, multiply by the Madelung constant: -1.763 \u00d7 664 J/m = -1165.55 J/m\n\nHowever, the question asks for the molar crystal energy, so we need to convert from J/m to J/mole.\n\nStep 5: Convert from J/m to J/mole.\nThe volume of a unit cell in a cubic crystal is (r+ + r-)^3. So, the volume is (3.48 \u00d7 10^-10 m)^3 = 4.13 \u00d7 10^-29 m^3.\n\nThe number of unit cells in a mole is Avogadro's number (6.022 \u00d7 10^23) divided by the volume of a unit cell (4.13 \u00d7 10^-29 m^3) = 1.46 \u00d7 10^52 unit cells/mole.\n\nTherefore, the molar crystal energy is: -1165.55 J/m \u00d7 1.46 \u00d7 10^52 unit cells/mole = -1.70 \u00d7 10^50 J/mole.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the answer in the format n \u00d7 10^x, where n is to 2 decimal places. Therefore, we can write the answer as -1.70 \u00d7 10^50 J/mole.\n\nStep 6: Write the final answer in the required format.\nThe final answer is \\boxed{-1.70 \u00d7 10^50}",
  "Step 1: First, let's understand the problem. We need to find the amount of boron (B) that, when substituted into 1 kg of germanium (Ge), will result in a charge carrier density of 3.091 x 10^17 / cm^3.\n\nStep 2: To solve this, we need to recall the relationship between the concentration of dopants and the charge carrier density in semiconductors. In a semiconductor, the charge carrier density is determined by the concentration of dopants. For a p-type semiconductor, the charge carrier density is equal to the concentration of holes (p-type dopants). Therefore, we can equate the charge carrier density to the concentration of boron atoms per unit volume.\n\nStep 3: The charge carrier density is given as 3.091 x 10^17 / cm^3. We need to convert this to atoms per cubic centimeter. Since 1 mole of atoms has a volume of 22.4 liters (or 22.4 x 10^6 cm^3), the number of atoms per cubic centimeter can be calculated as follows:\n\nNumber of atoms per cubic centimeter = (3.091 x 10^17

  "Problem: Determine the highest linear density of atoms (atoms/m) encountered in vanadium (V). Please format your answer as \\( n \\times 10^x \\) where \\( n \\) is to 2 decimal places.\n\nStep 1: First, we need to understand what linear density of atoms means. Linear density is the number of atoms per unit length along a specific direction. In this case, we're looking for the highest linear density of atoms in vanadium (V).\n\nStep 2: To find the highest linear density, we need to consider the crystal structure of vanadium. Vanadium is a metal with a body-centered cubic (BCC) crystal structure. In a BCC lattice, each atom is located at the center of a cube, with eight nearest neighbors at the corners of the cube.\n\nStep 3: The BCC lattice has a lattice parameter (a) which is the distance between the centers of two adjacent atoms. The lattice parameter can be related to the density of the material. However, to find the linear density of atoms, we need to consider the arrangement of atoms along a specific direction.\n\nStep 4: In a BCC lattice, the atoms are arranged in a way that along the body diagonal of the cube, the atoms are closest to each other. The body diagonal of a cube is given by \\( d = a \\sqrt{3} \\). Therefore, the distance between two adjacent atoms along the body diagonal is \\( a \\sqrt{3} \\).\n\nStep 5: The linear density of atoms along the body diagonal can be calculated by dividing the number of atoms per unit length by the distance between them. Since there is one atom per unit cell in a BCC lattice, the number of atoms per unit length along the body diagonal is \\( \\frac{1}{a \\sqrt{3}} \\).\n\nStep 6: To find the highest linear density, we need to express this in terms of the lattice parameter (a). However, the lattice parameter (a) is related to the density of the material. The density of vanadium is approximately 6.11 g/cm\u00b3. The lattice parameter can be calculated from the density using the formula: \\( \\rho = \\frac{Z \\times M}{N_A \\times a^3} \\), where Z is the number of atoms per unit cell (1 for BCC), M is the molar mass of vanadium (50.94 g/mol), N_A is Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10\u00b2\u00b3 mol\u207b\u00b9), and a is the lattice parameter.\n\nStep 7: Rearranging the formula to solve for a: \\( a = \\left( \\frac{Z \\times M}{N_A \\times \\rho} \\right)^{1/3} \\). Plugging in the values: \\( a = \\left( \\frac{1 \\times 50.94 \\text{ g/mol}}{6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\text{ mol}^{-1} \\times 6.11 \\text{ g/cm}^3} \\right)^{1/3} \\).\n\nStep 8: Calculating the lattice parameter: \\( a = \\left( \\frac{50.94}{6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\times 6.11} \\right)^{1/3} \\) = \\( \\left( \\frac{50.94}{3.67 \\times 10^{25}} \\right)^{1/3} \\) = \\( \\left( 1.39 \\times 10^{-25} \\right)^{1/3} \\) = \\( 2.67 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m} \\).\n\nStep 9: Now, we can calculate the linear density of atoms along the body diagonal: \\( \\frac{1}{a \\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{1}{2.67 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m} \\times \\sqrt{3}} \\) = \\( \\frac{1}{2.67 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m} \\times 1.732} \\) = \\( \\frac{1}{4.63 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m}} \\) = \\( 2.16 \\times 10^{8} \\text{ m}^{-1} \\).\n\nStep 10: Therefore, the highest linear density of atoms in vanadium is \\( 2.16 \\times 10^{8} \\text{ m}^{-1} \\). To express this in the required format \\( n \\times 10^x \\), where n is to 2 decimal places, we can write it as \\( 2.16 \\times 10^{8} \\text{ m}^{-1} \\). Since n is 2.16, which is already to 2 decimal places, x is 8. Therefore, the final answer is \\( 2.16 \\times 10^{8} \\text{ m}^{-1} \\), which can be written as \\( \\boxed{2.16 \\times 10^{8}} \\)",
  "Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem asks us to calculate the solubility of strontium fluoride (SrF2) in water, given its Ksp value as 2.45 \u00d7 10^(-9) at room temperature. We need to express the solubility in units of molarity.\n\nStep 2: Recall the formula for Ksp\nThe solubility product constant (Ksp) is defined as the product of the concentrations of the ions in a saturated solution. For SrF2, which dissociates into Sr2+ and F- ions, the Ksp expression is:\n\nKsp = [Sr2+][F-]^2\n\nStep 3: Set up the equation\nLet x be the molar solubility of SrF2. When x moles of SrF2 dissolve, it produces x moles of Sr2+ and 2x moles of F-.\n\nTherefore, the concentrations of Sr2+ and F- in the saturated solution are x and 2x, respectively.\n\nSo, the Ksp equation becomes:\n\n2.45 \u00d7 10^(-9) = x(2x)^2\n\nStep 4: Solve for x\nSubstitute the Ksp value and the concentrations into the equation:\n\n2.45 \u00d7 10^(-9) = x(4x^2)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n2.45 \u00d7 10^(-9) = 4x^3\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n6.125 \u00d7 10^(-10) = x^3\n\nTake the cube root of both sides:\n\nx = \u221b(6.125 \u00d7 10^(-10))\n\nStep 5: Calculate the cube root\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\nx \u2248 \u221b(6.125 \u00d7 10^(-10)) \u2248 1.58 \u00d7 10^(-3)\n\nSo, the molar solubility of SrF2 is approximately 1.58 \u00d7 10^(-3) M.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{1.58 \u00d7 10^(-3)}",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of diffusion and the equation for the concentration of a diffusing species as a function of time and position.\nStep 2:  The problem states that we want to dope a single crystal of silicon with boron to achieve a concentration of $5 \\times 10^{16}$ boron atoms per cubic centimeter at a depth of 25 micrometers from the surface within 90 minutes. We need to find the effective concentration of boron in units of atoms per cubic centimeter.\nStep 3:  The diffusion coefficient of boron in silicon is given as $7.23 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{~cm}^{2} / \\mathrm{s}$ at the processing temperature.\nStep 4:  The equation for the concentration of a diffusing species as a function of time and position is given by the solution to Fick's second law of diffusion, which is:\n\\[ C(x,t) = \\frac{Q}{2 \\sqrt{\\pi D t}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{4 D t}\\right) \\]\nwhere:\n- \\( C(x,t) \\) is the concentration at position \\( x \\) and time \\( t \\),\n- \\( Q \\) is the total amount of diffusing species,\n- \\( D \\) is the diffusion coefficient,\n- \\( t \\) is the time,\n- \\( x \\) is the position from the surface.\n\nStep 5:  In this case, we are given that the concentration at \\( x = 25 \\mu \\mathrm{m} \\) (which is \\( 2.5 \\times 10^{-4} \\mathrm{~cm} \\)) at time \\( t = 90 \\) minutes (which is \\( 5400 \\) seconds) should be \\( 5 \\times 10^{16} \\) atoms per cubic centimeter. We need to find the total amount \\( Q \\) that needs to be diffused.\n\nStep 6:  The equation can be rearranged to solve for \\( Q \\):\n\\[ Q = 2 \\sqrt{\\pi D t} \\cdot C(x,t) \\]\n\nStep 7:  Plugging in the given values:\n\\[ Q = 2 \\sqrt{\\pi \\cdot 7.23 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{~cm}^{2} / \\mathrm{s} \\cdot 5400 \\mathrm{~s}} \\cdot 5 \\times 10^{16} \\mathrm{~atoms/cm}^{3} \\]\n\nStep 8:  Calculating the square root:\n\\[ \\sqrt{\\pi \\cdot 7.23 \\times 10^{-9} \\cdot 5400} = \\sqrt{\\pi \\cdot 3.9042 \\times 10^{-6}} \\approx \\sqrt{1.224 \\times 10^{-5}} \\approx 1.107 \\times 10^{-3} \\]\n\nStep 9:  Then, multiplying by \\( 2 \\) and the concentration:\n\\[ Q = 2 \\cdot 1.107 \\times 10^{-3} \\cdot 5 \\times 10^{16} \\approx 2.107 \\times 10^{14} \\]\n\nStep 10:  Therefore, the total amount of boron that needs to be diffused is approximately \\( 2.107 \\times 10^{14} \\) atoms.\n\nStep 11:  To find the effective concentration, we need to divide this total amount by the volume of the crystal that is being doped. However, the problem does not specify the volume of the crystal. Therefore, we assume that the effective concentration is the concentration at the specified depth and time, which is given as \\( 5 \\times 10^{16} \\) atoms per cubic centimeter.\n\nStep 12:  Therefore, the effective concentration is \\( 5 \\times 10^{16} \\) atoms per cubic centimeter.\n\nStep 13:  However, the problem asks us to round the answer to 4 decimal places. Therefore, the final answer is \\( 5.0000 \\times 10^{16} \\) atoms per cubic centimeter.\n\nStep 14:  Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{5.0000e16}",
  "Step 1:  First, we need to understand the problem. An electron beam strikes a crystal of cadmium sulfide (CdS), and the electrons scattered by the crystal move at a velocity of $4.4 \\times 10^{5} \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$. We are asked to calculate the energy of the incident beam. The band gap of CdS is given as $2.45$ eV.\nStep 2:  To solve this problem, we can use the concept of the Compton scattering formula, which relates the energy of the incident photon to the energy of the scattered photon. However, in this case, the electrons are scattered by the crystal, so we need to consider the energy transfer from the incident electrons to the crystal lattice.\nStep 3:  The energy of the incident electrons can be calculated using the equation for the kinetic energy of an electron: $E = \\frac{1}{2} m v^2$, where $m$ is the mass of the electron and $v$ is its velocity.\nStep 4:  The mass of an electron is $9.11 \\times 10^{-31} \\mathrm{~kg}$, and the velocity is given as $4.4 \\times 10^{5} \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$.\nStep 5:  Plugging these values into the equation, we get: $E = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 9.11 \\times 10^{-31} \\mathrm{~kg} \\times (4.4 \\times 10^{5} \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s})^2$.\nStep 6:  Calculating this, we get: $E = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 9.11 \\times 10^{-31} \\mathrm{~kg} \\times 1.936 \\times 10^{11} \\mathrm{~m^2} / \\mathrm{s^2}$.\nStep 7:  Simplifying, we get: $E = 4.5 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{~J}$.\nStep 8:  To convert this energy from joules to electronvolts (eV), we use the conversion factor: $1 \\mathrm{~eV} = 1.6 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{~J}$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the energy in eV is: $E = \\frac{4.5 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{~J}}{1.6 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{~J/eV}}$.\nStep 10:  Calculating this, we get: $E = 2.8125 \\mathrm{~eV}$.\nStep 11:  Since the problem asks for the energy as an integer, we need to round this value to the nearest integer.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the energy of the incident beam is approximately 3 eV.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$",

It is defined as the ratio of the marginal utility of one good to the marginal utility of the other good.\n\nStep 3: Compute the marginal utilities\nTo find the MRS, we need to compute the marginal utilities of x and y. The marginal utility of x is the partial derivative of u(x, y) with respect to x, denoted as \u2202u/\u2202x. Similarly, the marginal utility of y is the partial derivative of u(x, y) with respect to y, denoted as \u2202u/\u2202y.\n\nStep 4: Compute \u2202u/\u2202x\nTo compute \u2202u/\u2202x, we differentiate u(x, y) = x^(1/2) + y with respect to x. Using the power rule for differentiation, we get:\n\n\u2202u/\u2202x = (1/2)x^(-1/2)\n\nStep 5: Compute \u2202u/\u2202y\nTo compute \u2202u/\u2202y, we differentiate u(x, y) = x^(1/2) + y with respect to y. Since y is a variable, the derivative is simply 1.\n\n\u2202u/\u2202y = 1\n\nStep 6: Compute the marginal rate of substitution (MRS)\nThe MRS is the ratio of the marginal utility of x to the marginal utility of y. Therefore, the MRS is:\n\nMRS = (\u2202u/\u2202x) / (\u2202u/\u2202y) = (1/2)x^(-1/2) / 1 = (1/2)x^(-1/2)\n\nStep 7: Simplify the MRS expression\nThe MRS can be simplified as:\n\nMRS = (1/2)x^(-1/2) = (1/2) / x^(1/2) = 1 / (2x^(1/2))\n\nTherefore, the marginal rate of substitution (MRS) at an arbitrary point (X, Y) is 1 / (2X^(1/2)).\n\nStep 8: Write the final answer\nThe final answer is \\boxed{1 / (2X^(1/2))}",

The production function is given by \\(Y = f(L, K)\\). The cost function is given by \\(C = wL + rK\\), where \\(w\\) is the wage rate and \\(r\\) is the rental rate of capital. The profit function is given by \\(\\pi = Y - C = f(L, K) - wL - rK\\).\n\nThe firm maximizes its profits subject to the production function constraint. In the short-term, the firm's capital is fixed, so \\(K\\) is a constant. The labor \\(L\\) is variable. The firm chooses the optimal labor \\(L\\) to maximize profits.\n\nThe first-order condition for profit maximization is:\n\n\\(\\frac{\\partial \\pi}{\\partial L} = 0\\)\n\nSince \\(Y = f(L, K)\\) and \\(C = wL + rK\\), we have:\n\n\\(\\pi = f(L, K) - wL - rK\\)\n\nSo, \\(\\frac{\\partial \\pi}{\\partial L} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial L} - w\\)\n\nSetting this equal to zero:\n\n\\(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial L} - w = 0\\)\n\nTherefore, the algebraic condition for a firm to be at an output level that maximizes its profits, given its capital in the short-term, is:\n\n\\(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial L} = w\\)\n\nwhere \\(f\\) is the production function, \\(w\\) is the wage rate, and \\(L\\) is the labor.\n\nAlternatively, we can express this condition in terms of the marginal product of labor (MPL) and the wage rate:\n\nMPL = \\(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial L}\\)\n\nTherefore, the condition is:\n\nMPL = w\n\nThis means that the marginal product of labor is equal to the wage rate. If the firm is at an output level that maximizes its profits, then the marginal product of labor is equal to the wage rate.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{MPL = w}",

  "The problem is not explicitly stated, but based on the preamble, it seems that we are dealing with a firm's long-term cost minimization problem. In such a problem, the firm's capital level is chosen to minimize its long-run average cost (LRAC). The SRAC (short-run average cost) is not directly relevant to the long-run cost minimization problem. However, the SRAC is related to the LRAC through the concept of the minimum of the SRAC curve.\n\nIn the long-run, the firm can adjust its capital stock to minimize its costs. The LRAC is the minimum of the SRAC curve, which is the average cost of producing a given output level in the short run. The SRAC curve is typically U-shaped, with the minimum point representing the optimal capital stock level.\n\nTherefore, the condition that involves the SRAC is that the firm chooses a capital stock level such that the SRAC is minimized. This is equivalent to saying that the firm chooses a capital stock level where the SRAC curve is tangent to the LRAC curve. Alternatively, the firm chooses a capital stock level where the SRAC curve is at its minimum point.\n\nSo, the condition that involves the SRAC is that the firm chooses a capital stock level such that the SRAC is minimized. This can be expressed mathematically as:\n\nSRAC'(K) = 0\n\nwhere K is the capital stock level, and SRAC'(K) is the derivative of the SRAC function with respect to K.\n\nTherefore, the condition that involves the SRAC is that the derivative of the SRAC function with respect to the capital stock level is equal to zero.\n\nAlternatively, the condition can be expressed as:\n\nSRAC(K) = LRAC\n\nwhere LRAC is the long-run average cost. This is because the LRAC is the minimum of the SRAC curve, so the firm chooses a capital stock level where the SRAC is equal to the LRAC.\n\nSo, the condition that involves the SRAC is that the SRAC is equal to the LRAC, or that the SRAC is minimized.\n\nTherefore, the condition that involves the SRAC is:\n\nSRAC(K) = LRAC\n\nor\n\nSRAC'(K) = 0\n\nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{SRAC'(K) = 0 or SRAC(K) = LRAC}",

  "Step 1: Understand the problem context\nThe problem involves a short-run industry supply function for widgets, where the output is supplied by 100 identical competitive firms. Each firm has a cost function given by \\( c_{s}(y) = \\frac{1}{3} y^{3} + 2 \\), and the demand for widgets is given by \\( y^{d}(p) = 6400 / p^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\). We need to derive the short-run industry supply function.\n\nStep 2: Recall the concept of short-run industry supply\nIn the short run, firms can adjust their output but not their scale of production. The industry supply function is the total output supplied by all firms in the industry as a function of the market price. Since all firms are identical and competitive, they will produce the same quantity at the same price.\n\nStep 3: Determine the profit-maximizing output for each firm\nTo find the industry supply function, we need to determine the profit-maximizing output for each firm. The profit function for each firm is given by:\n\n\\[ \\pi(y) = p \\cdot y - c_{s}(y) \\]\n\nwhere \\( p \\) is the market price, \\( y \\) is the output, and \\( c_{s}(y) \\) is the cost function.\n\nStep 4: Substitute the demand function into the profit function\nSince the demand function is given by \\( y^{d}(p) = 6400 / p^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\), we can substitute this into the profit function:\n\n\\[ \\pi(y) = p \\cdot y - \\left( \\frac{1}{3} y^{3} + 2 \\right) \\]\n\nBut since \\( y^{d}(p) = y \\), we can substitute \\( y = 6400 / p^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\) into the profit function:\n\n\\[ \\pi(y) = p \\cdot \\left( \\frac{6400}{p^{\\frac{1}{2}}} \\right) - \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\left( \\frac{6400}{p^{\\frac{1}{2}}} \\right)^{3} + 2 \\right) \\]\n\nStep 5: Simplify the profit function\nLet's simplify the profit function:\n\n\\[ \\pi(y) = \\frac{6400p}{p^{\\frac{1}{2}}} - \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\left( \\frac{6400}{p^{\\frac{1}{2}}} \\right)^{3} + 2 \\right) \\]\n\n\\[ \\pi(y) = 6400p^{\\frac{1}{2}} - \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\left( \\frac{6400^{3}}{p^{3/2}} \\right) + 2 \\right) \\]\n\n\\[ \\pi(y) = 6400p^{\\frac{1}{2}} - \\left( \\frac{6400^{3}}{3p^{3/2}} + 2 \\right) \\]\n\n\\[ \\pi(y) = 6400p^{\\frac{1}{2}} - \\frac{6400^{3}}{3p^{3/2}} - 2 \\]\n\nStep 6: Find the first-order condition for profit maximization\nTo find the profit-maximizing output, we need to take the derivative of the profit function with respect to output and set it equal to zero:\n\n\\[ \\frac{d\\pi}{dy} = 0 \\]\n\nBut since the profit function is in terms of price, we need to use the inverse demand function to express the derivative in terms of output. However, since the problem asks for the industry supply function, which is the total output supplied as a function of price, we can proceed by finding the inverse supply function.\n\nStep 7: Find the inverse supply function\nThe inverse supply function is the output supplied as a function of price. To find this, we need to solve the profit-maximizing condition for each firm. Since all firms are identical, they will produce the same quantity at the same price.\n\nLet's denote the profit-maximizing output for each firm as \\( y^{*} \\). Then, the inverse supply function is:\n\n\\[ y^{*} = f(p) \\]\n\nwhere \\( f(p) \\) is the inverse supply function.\n\nStep 8: Solve the profit-maximizing condition\nTo find the profit-maximizing output, we need to solve the first-order condition:\n\n\\[ \\frac{d\\pi}{dy} = 0 \\]\n\nBut since the profit function is in terms of price, we need to use the inverse demand function to express the derivative in terms of output. However, since the problem asks for the industry supply function, which is the total output supplied as a function of price, we can proceed by finding the inverse supply function.\n\nLet's denote the inverse demand function as:\n\n\\[ p = g(y) \\]\n\nwhere \\( g(y) \\) is the inverse demand function.\n\nThen, the profit function can be written as:\n\n\\[ \\pi(y) = g(y) \\cdot y - c_{s}(y) \\]\n\nThe first-order condition is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{d\\pi}{dy} = g(y) + y \\cdot g'(y) - c_{s}'(y) = 0 \\]\n\nBut since the inverse demand function is given by:\n\n\\[ p = g(y) = \\frac{6400}{y^{\\frac{1}{2}}} \\]\n\nThen, the derivative of the inverse demand function is:\n\n\\[ g'(y) = -\\frac{6400}{2y^{\\frac{3}{2}}} = -\\frac{3200}{y^{\\frac{3}{2}}} \\]\n\nSo, the first-order condition becomes:\n\n\\[ \\frac{6400}{y^{\\frac{1}{2}}} + y \\cdot \\left( -\\frac{3200}{y^{\\frac{3}{2}}} \\right) - c_{s}'(y) = 0 \\]\n\nSubstituting the cost function:\n\n\\[ c_{s}'(y) = y^{2} \\]\n\nSo, the first-order condition becomes:\n\n\\[ \\frac{6400}{y^{\\frac{1}{2}}} - \\frac{3200}{y^{\\frac{1}{2}}} + y^{2} = 0 \\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[ 3200y^{-\\frac{1}{2}} + y^{2} = 0

  "Let's solve the problem step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem is about a consumer with utility function u(x, y) = x^(1/2) + y, where x and y are the quantities of the first and second goods, respectively. The price of the second good (y) is 1, and the price of the first good (x) is p > 0. The consumer's income is m > 1/(4p). We need to find the optimal quantity of the first good (x) in terms of m and p.\n\n## Step 2: Write down the budget constraint\nThe budget constraint is given by the income m, the price of the first good p, and the price of the second good 1. So, the budget constraint is:\n\np * x + 1 * y = m\n\n## Step 3: Express y in terms of x and m\nFrom the budget constraint, we can express y as:\n\ny = m - p * x\n\n## Step 4: Substitute y into the utility function\nSubstitute y = m - p * x into the utility function u(x, y) = x^(1/2) + y:\n\nu(x, y) = x^(1/2) + (m - p * x)\n\n## Step 5: Find the first-order condition for maximization\nTo maximize the utility function subject to the budget constraint, we need to find the first-order condition. Let's differentiate the utility function with respect to x:\n\n\u2202u/\u2202x = (1/2)x^(-1/2) - p\n\n## Step 6: Set the first-order condition equal to zero\nSet \u2202u/\u2202x = 0:\n\n(1/2)x^(-1/2) - p = 0\n\n## Step 7: Solve for x\nSolve for x:\n\n(1/2)x^(-1/2) = p\n\nx^(-1/2) = 2p\n\nx = (2p)^(-2)\n\nx = (4p^2)^(-1)\n\nx = 1/(4p^2)\n\n## Step 8: Check the second-order condition\nTo ensure that this is a maximum, we need to check the second-order condition. Let's compute the second derivative:\n\n\u2202\u00b2u/\u2202x\u00b2 = (-1/2)x^(-3/2)\n\nAt x = 1/(4p^2), the second derivative is:\n\n\u2202\u00b2u/\u2202x\u00b2 = (-1/2)[1/(4p^2)]^(-3/2)\n\n= (-1/2)(4p^2)^3/2\n\n= (-1/2)(8p^3)\n\n= -4p^3\n\nSince the second derivative is negative, the point x = 1/(4p^2) is a maximum.\n\n## Step 9: Write the final answer\nTherefore, the optimal quantity of the first good (x) is:\n\nx = 1/(4p^2)\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{1/(4p^2)}",
  "Step 1: Understand the problem and the given information.\nThe problem is about finding the equilibrium price in the apple juice market. The supply curve is given by \\(Q_{S} = 10P_{J} - 5P_{A}\\), where \\(P_{J}\\) is the price of apple juice and \\(P_{A}\\) is the price of apples, which is fixed at $1. The demand curve is given by \\(Q_{D} = 100 - 15P_{J} + 10P_{T}\\), where \\(P_{T}\\) is the price of tea, which is given as $5. We need to find the equilibrium price of apple juice.\n\nStep 2: Write down the supply and demand equations.\nSupply equation: \\(Q_{S} = 10P_{J} - 5P_{A}\\)\nDemand equation: \\(Q_{D} = 100 - 15P_{J} + 10P_{T}\\)\n\nGiven that \\(P_{A} = 1\\) and \\(P_{T} = 5\\), substitute these values into both equations.\n\nSupply equation: \\(Q_{S} = 10P_{J} - 5(1) = 10P_{J} - 5\\)\n\nDemand equation: \\(Q_{D} = 100 - 15P_{J} + 10(5) = 100 - 15P_{J} + 50 = 150 - 15P_{J}\\)\n\nStep 3: Set the supply and demand equations equal to each other to find the equilibrium quantity.\nSince at equilibrium, the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded, we set \\(Q_{S} = Q_{D}\\).\n\nTherefore, \\(10P_{J} - 5 = 150 - 15P_{J}\\)\n\nStep 4: Solve the equation for \\(P_{J}\\).\nFirst, add 5 to both sides: \\(10P_{J} = 155 - 15P_{J}\\)\n\nThen, add \\(15P_{J}\\) to both sides: \\(25P_{J} = 155\\)\n\nDivide both sides by 25: \\(P_{J} = \\frac{155}{25}\\)\n\nStep 5: Calculate the value of \\(P_{J}\\).\n\\(P_{J} = \\frac{155}{25} = 6.2\\)\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium price of apple juice is $6.20.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{6.2}",
  "Step 1: Understand the problem context\nThe city of Cambridge needs to set the price of apples within its borders. There are two sources of apples: a local orchard that can produce up to 50 apples per day at a marginal cost of 25 cents per apple, and a store that ships apples from out of state at a marginal cost of 75 cents per apple. The demand for apples is 150 apples per day when the price is 75 cents per apple.\n\nStep 2: Determine the demand function\nSince the demand is 150 apples when the price is 75 cents, we can express the demand function as Q = 150 when P = 75. However, the problem doesn't provide a general demand function. We need to find the price that maximizes the city's revenue, given the supply from the orchard and the store.\n\nStep 3: Formulate the supply functions\nThe local orchard can supply up to 50 apples per day at a marginal cost of 25 cents. The store can supply any remaining apples demanded, at a marginal cost of 75 cents per unit. Let's denote the quantity supplied by the orchard as Q_orchard and the quantity supplied by the store as Q_store.\n\nSince the orchard can supply up to 50 apples, Q_orchard \u2264 50. The store supplies the remaining demand, so Q_store = 150 - Q_orchard.\n\nStep 4: Determine the total supply\nThe total supply is the sum of the quantities supplied by the orchard and the store: Q_total = Q_orchard + Q_store = Q_orchard + (150 - Q_orchard) = 150.\n\nStep 5: Formulate the revenue function\nThe revenue is the product of the price and the quantity sold. Let's denote the price as P. Then, the revenue is R = P * Q_total = P * 150.\n\nStep 6: Find the optimal price\nTo maximize revenue, we need to find the price that maximizes R = 150P. Since the quantity sold is fixed at 150, the revenue is directly proportional to the price. Therefore, the optimal price is the highest price that the market can bear, which is the price at which the demand equals the total supply.\n\nStep 7: Find the optimal price\nSince the demand is 150 apples when the price is 75 cents, and the total supply is also 150 apples, the optimal price is 75 cents.\n\nTherefore, the city should set the price at 75 cents to maximize revenue.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{75}",
  "Step 1: Understand the problem context\nThe problem is about a factory that produces cans of peanut butter. The factory is facing a lawsuit due to food poisoning, and Judge Judy is considering two equivalent options to punish the company: either pay a lump sum equal to the profits or impose a tax on each can equal to the profit per can. We need to find the tax amount in dollars per can.\n\nStep 2: Identify the given information\n- Market price per can: $10\n- Marginal cost (MC) at output level 5: $10\n- Average total cost (ATC) at output level 5: $6\n- Marginal cost (MC) at output level 4: $4\n- Average total cost (ATC) at output level 4: $4\n\nStep 3: Determine the profit-maximizing output\nTo find the profit-maximizing output, we need to equate marginal cost (MC) with market price (P). Since the market price is $10, we need to find the output level where MC equals $10.\n\nFrom the given information, we see that at output level 5, MC is $10, which matches the market price. Therefore, the profit-maximizing output is 5 cans.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the profit per can\nThe profit per can is the difference between the market price and the average total cost at the profit-maximizing output. Since the profit-maximizing output is 5 cans, we need to find the ATC at output level 5.\n\nGiven that ATC(5) = 6, the profit per can is P - ATC(5) = 10 - 6 = $4.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the tax amount\nThe tax amount is the profit per can, which is $4.\n\nTherefore, the tax amount is $4 per can.\n\nStep 6: Write the final answer\nThe final answer is \\boxed{4}",
  "Step 1: Understand the problem and the given information. We are dealing with two consumers, Albie and Bubbie, who demand strawberries. Their demand functions are given by \\(q_{a}(p) = p^{\\alpha} f_{a}(I_{a})\\) and \\(q_{b}(p) = p^{\\beta} f_{b}(I_{b})\\), where \\(I_{a}\\) and \\(I_{b}\\) are their incomes, and \\(f_{a}(\\cdot)\\) and \\(f_{b}(\\cdot)\\) are unknown functions. We need to find Albie's own-price elasticity of demand, \\(\\epsilon_{q_{a}, p}\\), using the formula \\(\\epsilon_{y, x} = \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x} \\frac{x}{y}\\).\n\nStep 2: Identify the variables and parameters involved. Here, \\(q_{a}\\) is Albie's demand, \\(p\\) is the price, \\(I_{a}\\) is Albie's income, \\(\\alpha\\) is a parameter, and \\(f_{a}(I_{a})\\) is an unknown function. We need to find \\(\\frac{\\partial q_{a}}{\\partial p}\\) and then compute \\(\\epsilon_{q_{a}, p}\\).\n\nStep 3: Compute \\(\\frac{\\partial q_{a}}{\\partial p}\\). Since \\(q_{a}(p) = p^{\\alpha} f_{a}(I_{a})\\), using the product rule, we have:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial q_{a}}{\\partial p} = \\alpha p^{\\alpha - 1} f_{a}(I_{a}) + p^{\\alpha} \\frac{\\partial f_{a}(I_{a})}{\\partial p}\n\\]\nHowever, since \\(I_{a}\\) is a constant (Albie's income does not depend on the price), \\(\\frac{\\partial f_{a}(I_{a})}{\\partial p} = 0\\). Therefore, the derivative simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial q_{a}}{\\partial p} = \\alpha p^{\\alpha - 1} f_{a}(I_{a})\n\\]\n\nStep 4: Compute \\(\\epsilon_{q_{a}, p}\\) using the formula \\(\\epsilon_{y, x} = \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x} \\frac{x}{y}\\). Here, \\(y = q_{a}\\) and \\(x = p\\), so:\n\\[\n\\epsilon_{q_{a}, p} = \\frac{\\partial q_{a}}{\\partial p} \\frac{p}{q_{a}}\n\\]\nSubstituting the expressions for \\(\\frac{\\partial q_{a}}{\\partial p}\\) and \\(q_{a}\\), we get:\n\\[\n\\epsilon_{q_{a}, p} = \\left(\\alpha p^{\\alpha - 1} f_{a}(I_{a})\\right) \\frac{p}{p^{\\alpha} f_{a}(I_{a})}\n\\]\nSimplifying, we have:\n\\[\n\\epsilon_{q_{a}, p} = \\alpha \\frac{p}{p^{\\alpha}} = \\alpha \\frac{1}{p^{\\alpha - 1}}\n\\]\nTherefore, Albie's own-price elasticity of demand is \\(\\alpha \\frac{1}{p^{\\alpha - 1}}\\).\n\nStep 5: Since the problem does not specify the value of \\(\\alpha\\) or \\(p\\), we cannot compute a numerical answer. However, the elasticity is a function of \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(p\\). If we were given specific values for \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(p\\), we could substitute them in to find the numerical value of the elasticity.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{\\alpha \\frac{1}{p^{\\alpha - 1}}}",
  "To solve for the equations of demand in this market, we need to use the given information about the own price elasticities of demand and supply, the price last year, and the quantity sold last year.\n\nFirst, let's recall that the own price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in quantity demanded in response to a 1% change in price. Mathematically, it is defined as:\n\n\\[ \\eta_d = \\frac{\\partial X_d}{\\partial P} \\cdot \\frac{P}{X_d} \\]\n\nwhere \\( \\eta_d \\) is the own price elasticity of demand, \\( X_d \\) is the quantity demanded, and \\( P \\) is the price.\n\nSimilarly, the own price elasticity of supply is:\n\n\\[ \\eta_s = \\frac{\\partial X_s}{\\partial P} \\cdot \\frac{P}{X_s} \\]\n\nwhere \\( X_s \\) is the quantity supplied.\n\nGiven that the own price elasticity of demand is -0.25 and the own price elasticity of supply is 0.5, we can write:\n\n\\[ \\eta_d = -0.25 = \\frac{\\partial X_d}{\\partial P} \\cdot \\frac{P}{X_d} \\]\n\n\\[ \\eta_s = 0.5 = \\frac{\\partial X_s}{\\partial P} \\cdot \\frac{P}{X_s} \\]\n\nSince the market is competitive, the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied, so \\( X_d = X_s = X \\). Therefore, we can set the two elasticities equal to each other:\n\n\\[ -0.25 = 0.5 \\]\n\nThis is a contradiction, which means that the given elasticities cannot both be true in a competitive market. However, this is a common issue in economics problems where the elasticities are given as point estimates rather than interval estimates. In such cases, we can assume that the elasticities are valid over a specific range of prices, and the problem is asking us to find the demand equation within that range.\n\nAlternatively, if we assume that the elasticities are valid at the given price and quantity, we can proceed as follows.\n\nGiven that the own price elasticity of demand is -0.25, we can write:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\partial X_d}{\\partial P} = -0.25 \\cdot \\frac{X_d}{P} \\]\n\nSimilarly, for supply:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\partial X_s}{\\partial P} = 0.5 \\cdot \\frac{X_s}{P} \\]\n\nSince \\( X_d = X_s = X \\), we can set the two derivatives equal to each other:\n\n\\[ -0.25 \\cdot \\frac{X}{P} = 0.5 \\cdot \\frac{X}{P} \\]\n\nThis equation is inconsistent, as shown above. However, if we assume that the elasticities are valid at the given price and quantity, we can proceed as follows.\n\nGiven that the price last year was $20 per ton, and 100 million tons were sold, we can write:\n\n\\[ X_d = X_s = 100 \\]\n\nSubstituting this into the demand equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\partial X_d}{\\partial P} = -0.25 \\cdot \\frac{100}{P} \\]\n\nIntegrating both sides with respect to P:\n\n\\[ X_d = -0.25 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\ln(P) + C \\]\n\nwhere C is the constant of integration.\n\nSince at P = 20, X_d = 100:\n\n\\[ 100 = -0.25 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\ln(20) + C \\]\n\nSolving for C:\n\n\\[ C = 100 + 0.25 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\ln(20) \\]\n\nTherefore, the demand equation is:\n\n\\[ X_d = -0.25 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\ln(P) + 100 + 0.25 \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\ln(20) \\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[ X_d = -25 \\ln(P) + 100 + 25 \\ln(20) \\]\n\n\\[ X_d = -25 \\ln(P) + 100 + 25 \\ln(20) \\]\n\n\\[ X_d = -25 \\ln(P) + 100 + 25 \\ln(20) \\]\n\n\\[ X_d = -25 \\ln(P) + 100 +

  "The problem is to find the energy levels of a harmonic oscillator subjected to a perturbation by a constant electric field. The unperturbed potential is given by \\(V(x) = \\frac{1}{2} k x^2\\), and the energy levels are those of a harmonic oscillator with \\(\\omega = \\sqrt{k/m_e}\\), \\(E_v = \\hbar \\omega (v + 1/2)\\), and eigenstates \\(\\psi_v(x) = (v!)^{-1/2} (\\hat{a}^\\dagger)^v \\psi_{v=0}(x)\\). When a constant electric field \\(E_0\\) is applied, the potential becomes \\(V(x) = \\frac{1}{2} k x^2 + E_0 e x\\). We need to find the energy levels \\(E_v\\) as a function of the strength of the electric field.\n\n## Step 1: Identify the perturbation\nThe unperturbed Hamiltonian is \\(H_0 = \\frac{1}{2} m_e \\omega^2 x^2\\), where \\(\\omega = \\sqrt{k/m_e}\\). The perturbation is the electric field term, \\(V_p(x) = E_0 e x\\).\n\n## Step 2: Determine the perturbation parameter\nThe perturbation parameter is the strength of the electric field, \\(E_0\\). Since the electric field is constant, the perturbation is linear in \\(x\\).\n\n## Step 3: Recall the formula for energy levels in perturbation theory\nIn perturbation theory, the energy levels are given by the unperturbed energy levels plus corrections due to the perturbation. The correction to the energy level \\(E_v\\) is given by the expectation value of the perturbation in the unperturbed state \\(\\psi_v(x)\\), i.e., \\(\\Delta E_v = \\langle \\psi_v | V_p | \\psi_v \\rangle\\).\n\n## Step 4: Compute the expectation value of the perturbation\nThe perturbation is \\(V_p(x) = E_0 e x\\). The expectation value of this perturbation in the state \\(\\psi_v(x)\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\langle \\psi_v | V_p | \\psi_v \\rangle = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\psi_v^*(x) E_0 e x \\psi_v(x) dx\n\\]\n\n## Step 5: Evaluate the integral\nTo evaluate the integral, we need to know the explicit form of \\(\\psi_v(x)\\). For a harmonic oscillator, the eigenstates are given by:\n\n\\[\n\\psi_v(x) = (v!)^{-1/2} (\\hat{a}^\\dagger)^v \\psi_{v=0}(x)\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\psi_{v=0}(x)\\) is the ground state wave function, which is a Gaussian:\n\n\\[\n\\psi_{v=0}(x) = \\left(\\frac{m_e \\omega}{\\pi \\hbar}\\right)^{1/4} e^{-m_e \\omega x^2 / 2 \\hbar}\n\\]\n\n## Step 6: Compute the expectation value\nSubstituting the expression for \\(\\psi_v(x)\\) into the integral, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\langle \\psi_v | V_p | \\psi_v \\rangle = E_0 e \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\psi_v^*(x) x \\psi_v(x) dx\n\\]\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the integral\nSince \\(\\psi_v(x)\\) is a Gaussian, the integral can be evaluated using the properties of Gaussian integrals. Specifically, the integral of \\(x \\psi_v(x)\\) is proportional to the derivative of \\(\\psi_v(x)\\).\n\n## Step 8: Compute the derivative of \\(\\psi_v(x)\\)\nThe derivative of \\(\\psi_v(x)\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dx} \\psi_v(x) = (v!)^{-1/2} (\\hat{a}^\\dagger)^v \\frac{d}{dx} \\psi_{v=0}(x)\n\\]\n\n## Step 9: Evaluate the derivative of \\(\\psi_{v=0}(x)\\)\nThe derivative of \\(\\psi_{v=0}(x)\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dx} \\psi_{v=0}(x) = -\\frac{m_e \\omega}{\\hbar} x \\psi_{v=0}(x)\n\\]\n\n## Step 10: Substitute the derivative into the integral\nSubstituting the derivative into the integral, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\langle \\psi_v | V_p | \\psi_v \\rangle = E_0 e \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\psi_v^*(x) x \\left(-\\frac{m_e \\omega}{\\hbar} x \\psi_{v=0}(x)\\right) dx\n\\]\n\n## Step 11: Simplify the integral\nThe integral can be simplified by canceling the \\(x\\) terms:\n\n\\[\n\\langle \\psi_v | V_p | \\psi_v \\rangle = -\\frac{E_0 e m_e \\omega}{\\hbar} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\psi_v^*(x) x^2 \\psi_{v=0}(x) dx\n\\]\n\n## Step 12: Evaluate the integral\nThe integral is proportional to the expectation value of \\(x^2\\) in the state \\(\\psi_v(x)\\). For a harmonic oscillator, the expectation value of \\(x^2\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\langle x^2 \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 m_e \\omega} (2 v + 1)\n\\]\n\n## Step 13: Substitute the expectation value into the integral\nSubstituting the expectation value into the integral, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\langle \\psi_v | V_p | \\psi_v \\rangle = -\\frac{E_0 e m_e \\omega}{\\hbar} \\frac{\\hbar}{2 m_e \\omega} (2 v + 1) = -\\frac{E_0 e}{2} (2 v + 1)\n\\]\n\n## Step 14: Add the perturbation correction to the unperturbed energy\nThe corrected energy level is:\n\n\\[\nE_v = E_{v,0} + \\Delta E_v = \\hbar \\omega (v + 1/2) - \\frac{E_0 e}{2} (2 v + 1)\n\\]\n\n## Step 15: Simplify the expression\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\n\\[\nE_v = \\hbar \\omega (v + 1/2) - E_0 e (v + 1/2)\n\\]\n\n## Step 16: Factor out the common term\nFactoring out the common term \\((v + 1/2)\\), we get:\n\n\\[\nE_v = \\hbar \\omega (v + 1/2) - E_0 e (v + 1/2) = (\\hbar \\omega - E_0 e) (v + 1/2)\n\\]\n\n## Step 17: Write the final expression\nThe final expression for the energy levels is:\n\n\\[\nE_v = (\\hbar \\omega - E_0 e) (v + 1/2)\n\\]\n\n## Step 18: Note that the energy levels are shifted by the electric field\nThe energy levels are shifted by the electric field term \\(-E_0 e\\). The shift is proportional to the strength of the electric field.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{(\\hbar \\omega - E_0 e) (v + 1/2)}",
  "Step 1:  The problem requires us to find the energy difference between the $1 s^{2} 2 p_{x}^{2}$ configuration and the $1 s^{2} 2 s^{2}$ configuration using the independent particle model. To do this, we need to calculate the total energy for each configuration and then find the difference between them.\nStep 2:  First, let's recall that in the independent particle model, the total energy of an atom is given by the sum of the energies of each electron in the atom. The energy of an electron in a particular orbital is given by the sum of the Coulomb integrals (J) and the exchange integrals (K) for that orbital.\nStep 3:  The given Coulomb and exchange integrals are:\n- $\\mathrm{J}_{1 s 1 s}=17.0 Z$\n- $\\mathrm{~J}_{1 s 2 s}=4.8 Z$\n- $\\mathrm{~K}_{1 s 2 s}=0.9 Z$\n- $\\mathrm{~J}_{2 s 2 s}=3.5 Z$\n- $\\mathrm{J}_{1 s 2 p}=6.6 Z$\n- $\\mathrm{~K}_{1 s 2 p}=0.5 Z$\n- $\\mathrm{~J}_{2 s 2 p}=4.4 Z$\n- $\\mathrm{~K}_{2 s 2 p}=0.8 Z$\n- $\\mathrm{J}_{2 p_{i}, 2 p_{i}}=3.9 Z$\n- $\\mathrm{~J}_{2 p_{i}, 2 p_{k}}=3.5 Z$\n- $\\mathrm{~K}_{2 p_{i}, 2 p_{k}}=0.2 Z$ for $i \\neq k$\nStep 4:  For the $1 s^{2} 2 s^{2}$ configuration, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the two 1s electrons and the two 2s electrons. Since the 1s electrons are in the same orbital, their energies are the same, and the same for the 2s electrons. Therefore, the total energy is:\n\\[2 \\times \\left( \\mathrm{J}_{1 s 1 s} + \\mathrm{J}_{1 s 2 s} + \\mathrm{K}_{1 s 2 s} + \\mathrm{J}_{2 s 2 s} \\right) = 2 \\times \\left( 17.0 Z + 4.8 Z + 0.9 Z + 3.5 Z \\right) = 2 \\times (25.2 Z) = 50.4 Z\\]\nStep 5:  For the $1 s^{2} 2 p_{x}^{2}$ configuration, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the two 1s electrons and the two 2p electrons. The 1s electrons are in the same orbital, so their energies are the same. The 2p electrons are in the same orbital, so their energies are the same. Therefore, the total energy is:\n\\[2 \\times \\left( \\mathrm{J}_{1 s 1 s} + \\mathrm{J}_{1 s 2 p} + \\mathrm{K}_{1 s 2 p} + \\mathrm{J}_{2 p_{i}, 2 p_{i}} + 2 \\times \\mathrm{J}_{2 p_{i}, 2 p_{k}} + 2 \\times \\mathrm{K}_{2 p_{i}, 2 p_{k}} \\right) = 2 \\times \\left( 17.0 Z + 6.6 Z + 0.5 Z + 3.9 Z + 2 \\times 3.5 Z + 2 \\times 0.2 Z \\right) = 2 \\times (34.4 Z + 7.0 Z) = 2 \\times 41.4 Z = 82.8 Z\\]\nStep 6:  Therefore, the energy difference between the $1 s^{2} 2 p_{x}^{2}$ configuration and the $1 s^{2} 2 s^{2}$ configuration is:\n\\[82.8 Z - 50.4 Z = 32.4 Z\\]\nStep 7:  So, the energy difference is 32.4 Z eV. Rounding to a single decimal place, the answer is 32.4 Z eV.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{32.4 Z}$",
  "Step 1: First, let's recall that the energy of a photon is given by the formula E = hc/\u03bb, where E is the energy of the photon, h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and \u03bb is the wavelength of the photon.\n\nStep 2: We are given that the wavelength of the Nd:YAG laser is 1.06 \u03bcm. We need to convert this wavelength to meters because Planck's constant and the speed of light are typically given in SI units. So, 1.06 \u03bcm = 1.06 \u00d7 10^(-6) m.\n\nStep 3: Planck's constant (h) is 6.626 \u00d7 10^(-34) J s, and the speed of light (c) is 3.00 \u00d7 10^8 m/s.\n\nStep 4: The energy of each photon is E = hc/\u03bb = (6.626 \u00d7 10^(-34) J s) \u00d7 (3.00 \u00d7 10^8 m/s) / (1.06 \u00d7 10^(-6) m) = 1.87 \u00d7 10^(-19) J.\n\nStep 5: The total energy of the laser pulse is given as 2.00 mJ = 2.00 \u00d7 10^(-3) J.\n\nStep 6: To find the number of photons in the pulse, we divide the total energy of the pulse by the energy of each photon: Number of photons = Total energy / Energy per photon = (2.00 \u00d7 10^(-3) J) / (1.87 \u00d7 10^(-19) J) = 1.07 \u00d7 10^16.\n\nStep 7: Rounding to three significant figures, the number of photons is approximately 1.1 \u00d7 10^16.\n\nStep 8: Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{1.1 \u00d7 10^16}",
  "Step 1: First, let's understand the problem. We are given that the work function of chromium is 4.40 eV, and we need to find the kinetic energy of electrons emitted from a clean chromium surface when it is irradiated with ultraviolet (UV) radiation of wavelength 200 nm. The task is to convert this kinetic energy from electronvolts (eV) to Joules (J).\n\nStep 2: To solve this problem, we need to recall the relationship between the energy of photons, the work function of a material, and the kinetic energy of emitted electrons. When a photon hits a surface, it can eject an electron if the photon's energy is greater than the work function of the material. The excess energy above the work function is converted into the kinetic energy of the emitted electron.\n\nStep 3: First, let's convert the wavelength of the UV radiation from nanometers to meters. The wavelength is 200 nm, which is 200 * 10^-9 m = 2 * 10^-7 m.\n\nStep 4: Next, we need to calculate the energy of the photons. The energy of a photon is given by E = hc / \u03bb, where h is Planck's constant (6.626 * 10^-34 J s), c is the speed of light (3 * 10^8 m/s), and \u03bb is the wavelength in meters.\n\nStep 5: Plugging in the values, we get E = (6.626 * 10^-34 J s * 3 * 10^8 m/s) / (2 * 10^-7 m) = 9.939 * 10^-19 J.\n\nStep 6: However, the problem is given in electronvolts (eV). To convert eV to Joules, we use the conversion factor 1 eV = 1.602 * 10^-19 J. Therefore, the energy of the photons in eV is 9.939 * 10^-19 J / (1.602 * 10^-19 J/eV) = 6.21 eV.\n\nStep 7: The work function of chromium is 4.40 eV. Therefore, the excess energy available for the kinetic energy of the emitted electron is 6.21 eV - 4.40 eV = 1.81 eV.\n\nStep 8: To convert this excess energy from eV to Joules, we multiply by the conversion factor: 1.81 eV * (1.602 * 10^-19 J/eV) = 2.90 * 10^-19 J.\n\nStep 9: Therefore, the kinetic energy of the electrons emitted from the chromium surface is 2.90 * 10^-19 J.\n\nStep 10: Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{2.90 * 10^-19}",
  "Step 1: First, we need to calculate the energy of the photon. The energy of a photon is given by the formula E = h\u03bd, where h is Planck's constant (6.626 \u00d7 10^-34 J s) and \u03bd is the frequency of the photon. However, we are given the wavelength (\u03bb) instead of the frequency. So, we need to find the frequency first.\n\nStep 2: The frequency of the photon can be calculated using the formula \u03bd = c / \u03bb, where c is the speed of light (3 \u00d7 10^8 m/s) and \u03bb is the wavelength (500 nm = 500 \u00d7 10^-9 m).\n\nStep 3: Plug in the values to calculate the frequency: \u03bd = (3 \u00d7 10^8 m/s) / (500 \u00d7 10^-9 m) = (3 \u00d7 10^8) / (5 \u00d7 10^-7) = 6 \u00d7 10^14 Hz.\n\nStep 4: Now that we have the frequency, we can calculate the energy of the photon using E = h\u03bd. So, E = (6.626 \u00d7 10^-34 J s) \u00d7 (6 \u00d7 10^14 Hz) = 3.9756 \u00d7 10^-19 J.\n\nStep 5: The momentum of the photon is given by p = E / c. So, p = (3.9756 \u00d7 10^-19 J) / (3 \u00d7 10^8 m/s) = 1.3252 \u00d7 10^-27 kg m/s.\n\nStep 6: To express the momentum in kilogram meters per second, we need to convert it to kg m/s. Since 1 kg m/s is equal to 1 kg m/s, the momentum is already in the desired units.\n\nStep 7: Rounding the momentum to three decimal places, we get 1.325 \u00d7 10^-27 kg m/s.\n\nStep 8: Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{1.325 \u00d7 10^-27}",

Therefore, we can take the positive root:\n\\[\n\\delta = -5 + \\sqrt{26} \\approx -5 + 5.099 = 0.099\n\\]\n\nSo, the perturbation correction is \\(\\delta \\approx 0.099\\).\n\nThen, the energy correction is:\n\\[\nE_{\\widetilde{10}}^{(2)} = \\frac{1}{10 + \\delta} = \\frac{1}{10 + 0.099} = \\frac{1}{10.099} \\approx 0.0991\n\\]\n\nRounding to one decimal place:\n\\[\nE_{\\widetilde{10}}^{(2)} \\approx 0.1\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{0.1}"
