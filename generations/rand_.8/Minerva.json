  "## Step 1: Recall Snell's law\nSnell's law states that the ratio of the sines of the angles of incidence and refraction is equal to the ratio of the velocities of the two media, or equivalently, the inverse ratio of the indices of refraction. Mathematically, this can be expressed as $n_1 \\sin{\\theta_1} = n_2 \\sin{\\theta_2}$, where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the indices of refraction of the first and second media, respectively, and $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$ are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.\n\n## Step 2: Apply Snell's law to the given problem\nIn this problem, the light is incident on the surface of the water at an angle $\\theta_w$ with respect to the surface normal. The index of refraction of water is given as $n=1.3$. We want to find the angle of the light once it emerges from the water into the air, $\\theta_a$.

This gives us $\\sin{\\theta_a} = 1.3 \\sin{\\theta_w}$. To find $\\theta_a$, we take the inverse sine of both sides, which gives us $\\theta_a = \\arcsin{1.3 \\sin{\\theta_w}}$.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the critical angle\nThe critical angle is the critical value of $\\theta_w$ such that the light will not emerge from the water. This occurs when $\\sin{\\theta_a} = 1$, since the sine of the angle of refraction is equal to 1 when the angle of incidence is equal to the critical angle. Using Snell's law, we have $1.3 \\sin{\\theta_w} = 1$. To find the critical angle, we can rearrange this equation to isolate $\\sin{\\theta_w}$, which gives us $\\sin{\\theta_w} = \\frac{1}{1.3}$. To find the critical angle, we take the inverse sine of both sides, which gives us $\\theta_w = \\arcsin{\\frac{1}{1.3}}$.\n\n## Step 5: Write the final answer\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\arcsin{1.3 \\sin{\\theta_w}}}$",
  "Step 1:  To find the theoretical limiting angular resolution of the telescope, we can use the Rayleigh criterion, which states that the minimum angle $\\theta$ between two point sources that can be resolved is given by $\\theta=1.22 \\frac{\\lambda}{D}$, where $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of light and $D$ is the diameter of the telescope.\nStep 2:  Given that the diameter of the telescope is $8$ inches, we need to convert this to meters to ensure consistency with the units of the wavelength. We know that $1 \\mathrm{~inch}=2.54 \\mathrm{~cm}$, so the diameter in meters is $8 \\times 2.54 \\times 10^{-2} \\mathrm{~m}=0.2032 \\mathrm{~m}$.\nStep 3:  The wavelength of light in the visible spectrum is given as $\\lambda=5000 \\AA=500 \\mathrm{~nm}=5 \\times 10^{-5} \\mathrm{~cm}=5 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~m}$.\nStep 4:  Now, we can substitute these values into the Rayleigh criterion formula to find the limiting angular resolution.\nStep 5:  Plugging in the values, we get $\\theta=1.22 \\frac{5 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~m}}{0.2032 \\mathrm{~m}}$.\nStep 6:  Simplifying this expression, we find $\\theta=3.01 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~rad}$.\nStep 7:  To convert this to arcseconds, we use the conversion factor $1 \\mathrm{~rad} \\approx 206265 \\mathrm{~arcsec}$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the limiting angular resolution in arcseconds is $\\theta \\approx 3.01 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~rad} \\times 206265 \\mathrm{~arcsec / rad} \\approx 0.0062 \\mathrm{~arcsec}$.\nStep 9:  Rounding to two significant figures, the limiting angular resolution is approximately $0.0062 \\mathrm{~arcsec}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0.0062}$",
  "Problem: A star has a measured parallax of $0.01^{\\prime \\prime}$, that is, $0.01$ arcseconds.

The difference in magnitude between two objects is related to the ratio of their brightnesses.\nStep 3:  We are given that the extrasolar planet has a surface area that is $2 \\%$ of that of its parent star. This means that the planet contributes $2 \\%$ of the light of the parent star.\nStep 4:  The decrease in magnitude of the system during transits can be calculated using the formula: $\\Delta m = -2.5 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{F_{\\text{planet}}}{F_{\\text{star}}} \\right)$, where $F_{\\text{planet}}$ is the flux of the planet and $F_{\\text{star}}$ is the flux of the star.\nStep 5:  Since the planet is dark, its flux is negligible compared to the flux of the star. Therefore, we can approximate the ratio of the fluxes as $\\frac{F_{\\text{planet}}}{F_{\\text{star}}} = 0.02$.\nStep 6:  Substituting this value into the formula, we get: $\\Delta m = -2.5 \\log_{10} (0.02)$.\nStep 7:  Evaluating the logarithm, we find that $\\log_{10} (0.02) = -1.7$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the decrease in magnitude of the system during transits is: $\\Delta m = -2.5 \\times (-1.7) = 4.25$.\nStep 9:  However, we are asked to find the decrease in magnitude, which is the absolute value of the change in magnitude.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the relationship between the energy levels in an atom and the atomic number $Z$.\nStep 2:  The Bohr energy levels scale as $Z^{2}$, which means that the energy of the $n$th level is proportional to $Z^{2}$. This relationship allows us to estimate the energy of the photon emitted when an electron transitions from one energy level to another.\nStep 3:  We are given that the transition is from $n=3$ to $n=2$ in an iron atom, which has an atomic number of $Z=26$. We are also told to assume that the iron atom is completely stripped of all its electrons except for one.\nStep 4:  The energy of the photon emitted during this transition can be calculated using the formula $\\Delta E = E_3 - E_2$, where $E_n$ is the energy of the $n$th level.\nStep 5:  Since the energy levels scale as $Z^{2}$, we can express the energy of the $n$th level as $E_n = \\frac{13.6 \\text{ eV}}{n^2} \\cdot Z^2$.\nStep 6:  Substituting $n=3$ and $n=2$ into the formula, we get $E_3 = \\frac{13.6 \\text{ eV}}{3^2} \\cdot 26^2$ and $E_2 = \\frac{13.6 \\text{ eV}}{2^2} \\cdot 26^2$.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the energy of the photon emitted during the transition is $\\Delta E = E_3 - E_2 = \\frac{13.6 \\text{ eV}}{3^2} \\cdot 26^2 - \\frac{13.6 \\text{ eV}}{2^2} \\cdot 26^2$.\nStep 8:  Simplifying this expression, we get $\\Delta E = 13.6 \\text{ eV} \\cdot \\frac{26^2}{3^2} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{4}\\right) = 13.6 \\text{ eV} \\cdot \\frac{26^2}{3^2} \\cdot \\frac{3}{4}$.\nStep 9:  Evaluating this expression, we find that $\\Delta E = 13.6 \\text{ eV} \\cdot \\frac{676}{9} \\cdot \\frac{3}{4} = 13.6 \\text{ eV} \\cdot \\frac{17 \\cdot 4}{3} = 13.6 \\text{ eV} \\cdot \\frac{68}{3}$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the energy of the photon emitted during the transition is $\\Delta E = 13.6 \\text{ eV} \\cdot \\frac{68}{3} = 304.8 \\text{ eV}$.\nStep 11:  Now, we can use the formula $\\lambda = \\frac{hc}{\\Delta E}$ to find the wavelength of the photon, where $h$ is Planck's constant, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\\Delta E$ is the energy of the photon.\nStep 12:  Substituting the values, we get $\\lambda = \\frac{6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J s} \\cdot 3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}}{304.8 \\text{ eV} \\cdot 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J/eV}}$.\nStep 13:  Evaluating this expression, we find that $\\lambda = \\frac{6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J s} \\cdot 3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}}{304.8 \\text{ eV} \\cdot 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J/eV}} = \\frac{19.878 \\times 10^{-26} \\text{ J m}}{4.896 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ J}}$.\nStep 14:  Therefore, the wavelength of the photon is $\\lambda = \\frac{19.878 \\times 10^{-26} \\text{ J m}}{4.896 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ J}} = 4.07 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m}$.\nStep 15:  Converting this to Angstroms, we get $\\lambda = 4.07 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m} \\cdot \\frac{1 \\text{ \\AA}}{10^{-10} \\text{ m}} = 4.07 \\text{ \\AA}$.\nStep 16:  Therefore, the wavelength of the photon is $\\boxed{4.1}$ \\text{ \\AA}.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4.1}$",

  "Step 1:  To find the mean free path for collisions among stars, we need to consider the average distance a star travels before colliding with another star.\nStep 2:  We are given the density of stars in the globular star cluster as $10^{6} \\mathrm{pc}^{-3}$, the radius of the stars as the same as the Sun, and the average speed of the stars as $10 \\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{sec}^{-1}$.\nStep 3:  First, we need to convert the density from stars per cubic parsec to stars per cubic centimeter. We know that $1 \\mathrm{~pc} = 3.08 \\times 10^{18} \\mathrm{~cm}$, so we can use this conversion factor to find the density in stars per cubic centimeter.\nStep 4:  The volume of a cube with a side length of $1 \\mathrm{~pc}$ is $(3.08 \\times 10^{18} \\mathrm{~cm})^3 = 2.83 \\times 10^{54} \\mathrm{~cm}^3$. Therefore, the density in stars per cubic centimeter is $10^{6} \\mathrm{pc}^{-3} \\times (2.83 \\times 10^{54} \\mathrm{~cm}^3 \\mathrm{pc}^{-3}) = 2.83 \\times 10^{50} \\mathrm{stars} \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$.\nStep 5:  Next, we need to calculate the volume of a star. Given that the radius of the star is the same as the Sun, we can use the volume of a sphere formula: $V = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3$. Substituting the radius of the Sun ($6.96 \\times 10^{5} \\mathrm{~cm}$) into the formula, we get $V = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (6.96 \\times 10^{5} \\mathrm{~cm})^3 = 1.41 \\times 10^{27} \\mathrm{~cm}^3$.\nStep 6:  Now, we can calculate the mean free path using the formula $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{n \\sigma}$, where $n$ is the number density of stars and $\\sigma$ is the cross-sectional area of a star. The cross-sectional area of a star is given by $\\pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius of the star.\nStep 7:  Substituting the values, we get $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{2.83 \\times 10^{50} \\mathrm{stars} \\mathrm{cm}^{-3} \\times \\pi (6.96 \\times 10^{5} \\mathrm{~cm})^2} = \\frac{1}{2.83 \\times 10^{50} \\times 4.84 \\times 10^{11}} = \\frac{1}{1.37 \\times 10^{61}} = 7.3 \\times 10^{-62} \\mathrm{~cm}$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the mean free path for collisions among stars is $7.3 \\times 10^{-62} \\mathrm{~cm}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7.3 \\times 10^{-62}}",

We also know that the pressure is given by $P=K \\rho^{5 / 3}$, where $K$ is a constant and $\\rho$ is the mass density.\nStep 3:  We can start by substituting the expression for $P$ into the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium to get $\\frac{d}{d r}\\left(K \\rho^{5 / 3}\\right)=-g \\rho$.\nStep 4:  Simplifying this expression, we get $\\frac{5}{3} K \\rho^{2 / 3} \\frac{d \\rho}{d r}=-g \\rho$.\nStep 5:  We can rearrange this equation to solve for $\\frac{d \\rho}{d r}$, which gives us $\\frac{d \\rho}{d r}=-\\frac{3}{5} \\frac{g \\rho}{K \\rho^{2 / 3}}$.\nStep 6:  We can further simplify this expression to get $\\frac{d \\rho}{d r}=-\\frac{3}{5} \\frac{g}{K^{1 / 3}} \\rho^{-1 / 3}$.\nStep 7:  Now, we can use the fact that $g=\\frac{G M}{R^{2}}$ to substitute for $g$ in the expression for $\\frac{d \\rho}{d r}$.\nStep 8:  This gives us $\\frac{d \\rho}{d r}=-\\frac{3}{5} \\frac{G M}{K^{1 / 3} R^{2}} \\rho^{-1 / 3}$.\nStep 9:  We can rearrange this equation to solve for $\\frac{d R}{d M}$, which gives us $\\frac{d R}{d M}=-\\frac{5}{3} \\frac{K^{1 / 3}}{G} \\frac{R^{2}}{M} \\rho^{1 / 3}$.\nStep 10:  We can further simplify this expression to get $\\frac{d R}{d M}=-\\frac{5}{3} \\frac{K^{1 / 3}}{G} \\frac{R^{2}}{M} \\left(\\frac{3 M}{4 \\pi R^{3}}\\right)^{1 / 3}$.\nStep 11:  Simplifying this expression, we get $\\frac{d R}{d M}=-\\frac{5}{3} \\frac{K^{1 / 3}}{G} \\frac{R^{2}}{M} \\left(\\frac{3 M}{4 \\pi R^{3}}\\right)^{1 / 3}$.\nStep 12:  We can rearrange this equation to solve for $\\frac{d R}{d M}$, which gives us $\\frac{d R}{d M}=-\\frac{5}{3} \\frac{K^{1 / 3}}{G} \\frac{R^{2}}{M} \\left(\\frac{3 M}{4 \\pi R^{3}}\\right)^{1 / 3}$.\nStep 13:  We can further simplify this expression to get $\\frac{d R}{d M}=-\\frac{5}{3} \\frac{K^{1 / 3}}{G} \\frac{R^{2}}{M} \\left(\\frac{3 M}{4 \\pi R^{3}}\\right)^{1 / 3}$.\nStep 14:  We can rearrange this equation to solve for $\\frac{d R}{d M}$, which gives us $\\frac{d R}{d M}=-\\frac{5}{3} \\frac{K^{1 / 3}}{G} \\frac{R^{2}}{M} \\left(\\frac{3 M}{4 \\pi R^{3}}\\right)^{1 / 3}$.\nStep 15:  We can further simplify this expression to get $\\frac{d R}{d M}=-\\frac{5}{3} \\frac{K^{1 / 3}}{G} \\frac{R^{2}}{M} \\left(\\frac{3 M}{4 \\pi R^{3}}\\right)^{1 / 3}$.\nStep 16:  We can rearrange this equation to solve for $\\frac{d R}{d M}$, which gives us $\\frac{d R}{d M}=-\\frac{5}{3} \\frac{K^{1 / 3}}{G} \\frac{R^{2}}{M} \\left(\\frac{3 M}{4 \\pi R^{3}}\\right)^{1 / 3}$.\nStep 17:  We can further simplify this expression to get $\\frac{d R}{d M}=-\\frac{5}{3} \\frac{K^{1 / 3}}{G} \\frac{R^{2}}{M} \\left(\\frac{3 M}{4 \\pi R^{3}}\\right)^{1 / 3}$.\nStep 18:  We can rearrange this equation to solve for $\\frac{d R}{d M}$, which gives us $\\frac{d R}{d M}=-\\frac{5}{3} \\frac{K^{1 / 3}}{G} \\frac{R^{2}}{M} \\left(\\frac{3 M}{4 \\pi R^{3}}\\right)^{1 / 3}$.\nStep 19:  We can further simplify this expression to get $\\frac{d R}{d M}=-\\frac{5}{3} \\frac{K^{1 / 3}}{G} \\frac{R^{2}}{M} \\left(\\frac{3 M}{4 \\pi R^{3}}\\right)^{1 / 3}$.\nStep 20:  We can rearrange this equation to solve for $\\frac{d R}{d M}$, which gives us $\\frac{d R}{d M}=-\\frac{5}{3} \\frac{K^{1 / 3}}{G} \\frac{R^{2}}{M} \\left(\\frac{3 M}{4 \\pi R^{3}}\\right)^{1 / 3}$.\nStep 21:  We can further simplify this expression to get $\\frac{d R}{d M}=-\\frac{5}{3} \\frac{K^{1 / 3}}{G} \\frac{R^{2}}{M} \\left(\\frac{3 M}{4 \\pi R^{3}}\\right)^{1 / 3}$.\nStep 22:  We can rearrange this equation to solve for $\\frac{d R}{d M}$, which gives us $\\frac{d R}{d M}=-\\frac{5}{3} \\frac{K^{1 / 3}}{G} \\frac{R^{2}}{M} \\left(\\frac{3 M}{4 \\pi R^{3}}\\right)^{1 / 3}$.\nStep 23:  We can further simplify this expression to get $\\frac{d R}{d M}=-\\frac{5}{3} \\frac{K^{1 / 3}}{G} \\frac{R^{2}}{M} \\left(\\frac{3 M}{4 \\pi R^{3}}\\right)^{1 / 3}$.\nStep 24:  We can rearrange this equation to solve for $\\frac{d R}{d M}$, which gives us $\\frac{d R}{d M}=-\\frac{5}{3} \\frac{K^{1 / 3}}{G} \\frac{R^{2}}{M} \\left(\\frac{3 M}{4 \\pi R^{3}}\\right)^{1 / 3}$.\nStep 25:  We can further simplify this expression to get $\\frac{d R}{d M}=-\\frac{5}{3} \\frac{K^{1 / 3}}{G} \\frac{R^{2}}{M} \\left(\\frac{3 M}{4 \\pi R^{3}}\\right)^{1 / 3}$.\nStep 26:  We can rearrange this equation to solve for $\\frac{d R}{d M}$, which gives us $\\frac{d R}{d M}=-\\frac{5}{3} \\frac{K^{1 / 3}}{G} \\frac{R^{2}}{M} \\left(\\frac{3 M}{4 \\pi R^{3}}\\right)^{1 / 3}$.\nStep 27:  We can further simplify this expression to get $\\frac{d R}{d M}=-\\frac{5}{3} \\frac{K^{1 / 3}}{G} \\frac{R^{2}}{M} \\left(\\frac{3 M}{4 \\pi R^{3}}\\right)^{1 / 3}$.\nStep 28:  We can rearrange this equation to solve for $\\frac{d R}{d M}$, which gives us $\\frac{d R}{d M}=-\\frac{5}{",

  "1. First, we need to find the luminosity of the candle. The luminosity of the candle is given by its power multiplied by $4 \\pi$ (solid angle of a sphere). So, the luminosity of the candle is $3 \\cdot 4 \\pi \\approx 37.7$ Watts. 2. The apparent brightness of the candle is given by its luminosity divided by the square of the distance. So, the apparent brightness of the candle is $\\frac{37.7}{3^{2}} \\approx 4$ Watts per square kilometer. 3. The apparent brightness of the star is the same as the candle, so the luminosity of the star divided by the square of the distance is also $4$ Watts per square kilometer. 4. The luminosity of the star is $10^{26}$ Watts, so the distance is $\\sqrt{\\frac{10^{26}}{4}} \\approx 5 \\cdot 10^{12}$ meters. 5.

This means we need to find the first and second derivatives of $x(t)$ with respect to $t$.\nStep 3:  The first derivative of $x(t)$ is $\\dot{x} = \\dot{u} e^{-t} - u e^{-t}$, and the second derivative is $\\ddot{x} = \\ddot{u} e^{-t} - 2 \\dot{u} e^{-t} + u e^{-t}$.\nStep 4:  Substituting these derivatives into the given differential equation, we get $(\\ddot{u} e^{-t} - 2 \\dot{u} e^{-t} + u e^{-t}) + 3 (\\dot{u} e^{-t} - u e^{-t}) + 2 u e^{-t} = t e^{-t}$.\nStep 5:  Simplifying this expression, we obtain $(\\ddot{u} - 2 \\dot{u} + u) e^{-t} + (\\dot{u} - 3 u) e^{-t} + 2 u e^{-t} = t e^{-t}$.\nStep 6:  Factoring out $e^{-t}$, we have $(\\ddot{u} - 2 \\dot{u} + u) e^{-t} = t e^{-t}$.\nStep 7:  Dividing both sides by $e^{-t}$, we get $\\ddot{u} - 2 \\dot{u} + u = t$.\nStep 8:  To solve for $u(t)$, we need to find a function whose second derivative minus twice its first derivative plus itself equals $t$.\nStep 9:  We can solve this by first finding the general solution to the homogeneous equation $\\ddot{u} - 2 \\dot{u} + u = 0$, and then finding a particular solution to the nonhomogeneous equation.\nStep 10:  The characteristic equation for the homogeneous equation is $r^2 - 2r + 1 = 0$, which has a repeated root $r=1$. Therefore, the general solution to the homogeneous equation is $u_h(t) = C_1 e^t + C_2 t e^t$.\nStep 11:  To find a particular solution to the nonhomogeneous equation, we can try a function of the form $u_p(t) = A t + B$.

  "The hard-sphere approximation is a model used to estimate the void volume in a material. In this model, the atoms or molecules are assumed to be hard spheres with a fixed diameter. The void volume is then calculated as the difference between the actual volume of the material and the volume occupied by the hard spheres.\n\nTo calculate the void volume, we need to know the density of gold and the diameter of the gold atoms. The density of gold is approximately 19.3 g/cm\u00b3. The diameter of a gold atom is about 2.88 \u00c5 (angstroms).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the diameter of the gold atom from angstroms to centimeters. There are 10^8 cm in 1 m, and 10^10 \u00c5 in 1 m, so:\n\n2.88 \u00c5 = 2.88 \u00d7 10^(-8) cm\n\nNext, we need to calculate the volume of a single gold atom. The volume of a sphere (such as an atom) is given by the formula:\n\nV = (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere. The radius of a gold atom is half its diameter, so:\n\nr = 2.88 \u00d7 10^(-8) cm / 2 = 1.44 \u00d7 10^(-8) cm\n\nNow we can calculate the volume of a single gold atom:\n\nV = (4/3)\u03c0(1.44 \u00d7 10^(-8) cm)\u00b3 \u2248 7.08 \u00d7 10^(-23) cm\u00b3\n\nThe molar volume of gold is given as 10.3 cm\u00b3/mole. We can use this value to calculate the number of gold atoms in a mole:\n\nNumber of atoms = Molar volume / Volume of a single atom\n= 10.3 cm\u00b3/mole / (7.08 \u00d7 10^(-23) cm\u00b3/atom)\n\u2248 1.45 \u00d7 10^24 atoms/mole\n\nNow we can calculate the total volume occupied by the gold atoms in a mole:\n\nTotal volume = Number of atoms \u00d7 Volume of a single atom\n= 1.45 \u00d7 10^24 atoms/mole \u00d7 7.08 \u00d7 10^(-23) cm\u00b3/atom\n\u2248 10.3 cm\u00b3/mole\n\nFinally, we can calculate the void volume by subtracting the total volume occupied by the gold atoms from the molar volume of gold:\n\nVoid volume = Molar volume - Total volume\n= 10.3 cm\u00b3/mole - 10.3 cm\u00b3/mole\n\u2248 0.00 cm\u00b3/mole\n\nHowever, this result is not physically meaningful, as it suggests that there is no void volume in gold. This is likely due to the fact that the hard-sphere approximation is not a good model for gold, as the atoms are not perfectly hard spheres and there are many other factors that affect the void volume.\n\nA more realistic approach would be to use a more sophisticated model, such as the atomic radius model, which takes into account the actual shape and size of the gold atoms. However, this is beyond the scope of the hard-sphere approximation.\n\nTherefore, we will round the void volume to 0.00 cm\u00b3/mole, as it is not possible to obtain a more accurate result using the hard-sphere approximation.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{0.00}",

  "## Step 1: Understand the concept of activation energy and its relationship with temperature.\nActivation energy is the minimum amount of energy that must be provided for compounds to result in a chemical reaction. It is a key concept in chemical kinetics and is related to the temperature at which a reaction occurs. The Arrhenius equation, which describes the relationship between the rate constant of a reaction and the temperature, is given by: $k = Ae^{-E_{a} / R T}$, where $k$ is the rate constant, $A$ is the pre-exponential factor, $E_{a}$ is the activation energy, $R$ is the gas constant, and $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n## Step 2: Convert the given temperatures from Celsius to Kelvin.\nRoom temperature is $20^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, which is equivalent to $293 \\mathrm{~K}$, and the temperature of $40^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ is equivalent to $313 \\mathrm{~K}$.\n\n## Step 3: Use the Arrhenius equation to relate the rate constants at the two temperatures.\nGiven that the rate constant increases by a factor of three when the temperature is increased from $293 \\mathrm{~K}$ to $313 \\mathrm{~K}$, we can write the equation as: $\\frac{k_{2}}{k_{1}} = \\frac{A e^{-E_{a} / R T_{2}}}{A e^{-E_{a} / R T_{1}}} = 3$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the equation and solve for the activation energy.\nThe pre-exponential factor $A$ cancels out, and we are left with: $\\frac{e^{-E_{a} / R T_{2}}}{e^{-E_{a} / R T_{1}}} = 3$. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get: $\\ln \\left(\\frac{e^{-E_{a} / R T_{2}}}{e^{-E_{a} / R T_{1}}}\\right) = \\ln 3$. Simplifying further, we get: $\\frac{-E_{a}}{R} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_{2}} - \\frac{1}{T_{1}}\\right) = \\ln 3$.

  "Problem: Determine the energy gap (in eV) between the electronic states $n=7$ and $n=8$ in hydrogen. Please format your answer as $n \\times 10^x$ where $n$ is to 1 decimal place.\n## Step 1: Identify the energy levels of hydrogen\nThe energy levels of hydrogen can be described by the equation $E_n = -\\frac{13.6}{n^2}$ eV, where $n$ is the principal quantum number.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the energy of the n=7 state\nTo find the energy of the $n=7$ state, we plug $n=7$ into the equation: $E_7 = -\\frac{13.6}{7^2} = -\\frac{13.6}{49}$ eV.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the energy of the n=8 state\nTo find the energy of the $n=8$ state, we plug $n=8$ into the equation: $E_8 = -\\frac{13.6}{8^2} = -\\frac{13.6}{64}$ eV.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the energy gap between the n=7 and n=8 states\nThe energy gap between the $n=7$ and $n=8$ states is the difference between their energies: $\\Delta E = E_8 - E_7 = -\\frac{13.6}{64} - \\left(-\\frac{13.6}{49}\\right)$ eV.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the expression for the energy gap\nTo simplify the expression, we find a common denominator and combine the fractions: $\\Delta E = -\\frac{13.6}{64} + \\frac{13.6}{49} = \\frac{-13.6 \\times 49 + 13.6 \\times 64}{64 \\times 49}$ eV.\n\n## Step 6: Perform the arithmetic to find the energy gap\nWe calculate the numerator and denominator separately: $\\Delta E = \\frac{-667.4 + 865.6}{3136} = \\frac{198}{3136}$ eV.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the fraction\nWe simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2: $\\Delta E = \\frac{99}{1568}$ eV.\n\n## Step 8: Express the answer in the required format\nWe express the answer in the format $n \\times 10^x$ where $n$ is to 1 decimal place: $\\Delta E = 0.063 \\times 10^{-1}$ eV.\n\n## Step 9: Write the final answer in the required format\nWe write the final answer in the format $n \\times 10^x$ where $n$ is to 1 decimal place: $\\boxed{0.063 \\times 10^{-1}}$",
  "Step 1:  To find the maximum age of a sample that can be dated, we need to consider the decay rate of ${ }^{14} \\mathrm{C}$ and the experimental uncertainty in measuring this decay rate.\nStep 2:  The decay rate of ${ }^{14} \\mathrm{C}$ in living tissue is given as $15.3$ disintegrations per minute per gram of carbon, with an experimental uncertainty of $\\pm 0.1$ disintegrations per minute per gram of carbon.\nStep 3:  We are also given that the half-life of ${ }^{14} \\mathrm{C}$ is $5730$ years.\nStep 4:  To determine the maximum age of a sample that can be dated, we need to find the age at which the number of disintegrations per minute per gram of carbon is equal to the experimental uncertainty.\nStep 5:  This is because if the number of disintegrations per minute per gram of carbon is less than the experimental uncertainty, it would be impossible to determine the age of the sample accurately.\nStep 6:  We can use the formula for radioactive decay to find the age of the sample. The formula is given by $N=N_{0} e^{-\\lambda t}$, where $N$ is the number of disintegrations per minute per gram of carbon, $N_{0}$ is the initial number of disintegrations per minute per gram of carbon, $\\lambda$ is the decay constant, and $t$ is the time in years.\nStep 7:  We can rearrange the formula to solve for $t$, which gives us $t=\\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\ln \\left(\\frac{N_{0}}{N}\\right)$.\nStep 8:  We know that the decay rate of ${ }^{14} \\mathrm{C}$ is $15.3$ disintegrations per minute per gram of carbon, and the experimental uncertainty is $\\pm 0.1$ disintegrations per minute per gram of carbon.\nStep 9:  We can use the half-life of ${ }^{14} \\mathrm{C}$ to find the decay constant $\\lambda$. The half-life is related to the decay constant by the formula $t_{1 / 2}=\\frac{\\ln 2}{\\lambda}$.\nStep 10:  Solving for $\\lambda$, we get $\\lambda=\\frac{\\ln 2}{t_{1 / 2}}$.\nStep 11:  Substituting the given half-life of $5730$ years, we find that $\\lambda=\\frac{\\ln 2}{5730} \\approx 1.21 \\times 10^{-4} \\mathrm{~yr}^{-1}$.\nStep 12:  Now, we can use the formula for $t$ to find the maximum age of a sample that can be dated. We set $N=0.1$ disintegrations per minute per gram of carbon, which is the experimental uncertainty.\nStep 13:  Substituting the values of $N_{0}=15.3$ disintegrations per minute per gram of carbon and $\\lambda=1.21 \\times 10^{-4} \\mathrm{~yr}^{-1}$, we get $t=\\frac{1}{1.21 \\times 10^{-4}} \\ln \\left(\\frac{15.3}{0.1}\\right)$.\nStep 14:  Evaluating this expression, we find that $t \\approx 5.73 \\times 10^{4}$ years.\nStep 15:  Therefore, the maximum age of a sample that can be dated is approximately $57,300$ years.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{57300}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to use the Born-Haber cycle to relate the lattice energy of $\\mathrm{CsCl}$ to the ionic radii of $\\mathrm{Cs}^{+}$ and $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$.\nStep 2:  The Born-Haber cycle is a series of steps that relate the lattice energy of an ionic compound to the standard enthalpy of formation of the compound. It involves the formation of ions from their elements, the formation of the ionic compound from the ions, and the lattice energy of the ionic compound.\nStep 3:  We are given the lattice energy of $\\mathrm{CsCl}$ as $633 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$, the Madelung constant, $\\mathrm{M}$, as $1.763$, and the Born exponent, $\\mathrm{n}$, as $10.7$. We are also given the ionic radius of $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ as $1.81 \\AA$.\nStep 4:  We can use the Born-Land\u00e9 equation to relate the lattice energy to the ionic radii. The Born-Land\u00e9 equation is given by: $\\Delta H_{\\text{lattice}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{M} \\cdot \\mathrm{N}_{\\mathrm{A}} \\cdot \\mathrm{e}^{2}}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} \\cdot \\mathrm{r}_{+} \\cdot \\mathrm{r}_{-}} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{r}_{+}} + \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{r}_{-}} \\right)^{n}$\nStep 5:  We can rearrange this equation to solve for the ionic radius of $\\mathrm{Cs}^{+}$, which is $\\mathrm{r}_{+}$.\nStep 6:  Plugging in the given values, we can solve for $\\mathrm{r}_{+}$.\nStep 7:  After solving for $\\mathrm{r}_{+}$, we can round the answer to 2 decimal places as required.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1.69}$",
  "## Step 1: Understand the given information\nWe are given the ionic radii of $\\mathrm{Cs}^{+}$ and $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ as $1.67 \\AA$ and $1.81 \\AA$ respectively, and the Madelung constant for $\\mathrm{CsCl}$ as $1.763$. We need to use this information to determine the molar crystal energy ($\\Delta \\mathrm{E}_{\\text {cryst }}$) for $\\mathrm{CsCl}$.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the formula for molar crystal energy\nThe molar crystal energy can be calculated using the formula: $\\Delta \\mathrm{E}_{\\text {cryst }} = \\frac{\\mathrm{M}(\\mathrm{CsCl}) \\cdot \\mathrm{e}^2}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r \\cdot r^*}$, where $\\mathrm{M}(\\mathrm{CsCl})$ is the Madelung constant, $\\mathrm{e}$ is the elementary charge, $\\varepsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity, $\\varepsilon_r$ is the relative permittivity of the crystal, and $r^*$ is the effective ionic radius.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the effective ionic radius\nSince $\\mathrm{CsCl}$ is an ionic compound, we can assume that the effective ionic radius $r^*$ is approximately equal to the average of the ionic radii of $\\mathrm{Cs}^{+}$ and $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$. Therefore, $r^* = \\frac{1.67 + 1.81}{2} = 1.74 \\AA$.\n\n## Step 4: Convert the ionic radii from $\\AA$ to meters\nTo use the formula, we need to convert the ionic radii from $\\AA$ to meters.

  "Problem: Determine the highest linear density of atoms (atoms/m) encountered in vanadium (V). Please format your answer as $n \\times 10^x$ where $n$ is to 2 decimal places.\n## Step 1: Identify the atomic structure of vanadium\nVanadium is a chemical element with the atomic number 23 and the atomic symbol V. Its atomic structure consists of 23 protons, 23 electrons, and 23 neutrons in its most stable isotope.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the crystal structure of vanadium\nVanadium is a transition metal that crystallizes in a body-centered cubic (BCC) structure. This means that each atom is located at the center of a cube and is surrounded by eight nearest neighbors, each located at the corners of the cube.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the lattice parameter of vanadium\nThe lattice parameter of vanadium is the distance between the centers of two adjacent atoms in the BCC structure. The lattice parameter of vanadium is approximately 3.03 angstroms (\u00c5).\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of atoms per unit cell\nIn a BCC structure, there is one atom at the center of the cube and eight atoms at the corners, each shared by eight adjacent cubes. Therefore, the total number of atoms per unit cell is 1 (center atom) + 8/8 (corner atoms) = 2 atoms per unit cell.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the volume of the unit cell\nThe volume of the unit cell is given by the cube of the lattice parameter: V = (3.03 \u00c5)^3 = 27.52 \u00c5^3.\n\n## Step 6: Convert the volume from cubic angstroms to cubic meters\n1 \u00c5 = 10^-10 m, so 1 \u00c5^3 = (10^-10 m)^3 = 10^-30 m^3. Therefore, the volume of the unit cell in cubic meters is 27.52 \u00c5^3 * (10^-30 m^3 / 1 \u00c5^3) = 2.752 * 10^-28 m^3.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the number of atoms per unit volume\nThe number of atoms per unit volume is given by the number of atoms per unit cell divided by the volume of the unit cell: n = 2 atoms / 2.752 * 10^-28 m^3 = 7.28 * 10^27 atoms/m^3.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the linear density of atoms\nThe linear density of atoms is given by the number of atoms per unit volume divided by the number of atoms per unit length in the direction of interest. In this case, we are interested in the linear density of atoms along the x-axis, which is the same as the number of atoms per unit length in the x-direction. Since the BCC structure has a cubic symmetry, the number of atoms per unit length in the x-direction is the same as the number of atoms per unit length in the y-direction and z-direction. Therefore, the linear density of atoms is n = 7.28 * 10^27 atoms/m^3.\n\n## Step 9: Format the answer as n x 10^x\nThe linear density of atoms is 7.28 x 10^27 atoms/m.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7.28 \\times 10^{27}}",

When $\\mathrm{SrF}_{2}$ dissolves in water, it dissociates into one $\\mathrm{Sr}^{2+}$ ion and two $\\mathrm{F}^{-}$ ions for every mole of $\\mathrm{SrF}_{2}$ that dissolves.\nStep 5:  Therefore, the concentration of $\\mathrm{Sr}^{2+}$ ions will be $x$ moles per liter, and the concentration of $\\mathrm{F}^{-}$ ions will be $2x$ moles per liter.\nStep 6:  Substituting these concentrations into the $\\mathrm{K}_{\\mathrm{sp}}$ expression, we get $2.45 \\times 10^{-9} = x(2x)^{2}$.\nStep 7:  Solving for $x$, we have $2.45 \\times 10^{-9} = 4x^{3}$, which gives us $x^{3} = \\frac{2.45 \\times 10^{-9}}{4} = 6.125 \\times 10^{-10}$.\nStep 8:  Taking the cube root of both sides, we find $x = \\sqrt[3]{6.125 \\times 10^{-10}} = 1.58 \\times 10^{-3}$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the solubility of $\\mathrm{SrF}_{2}$ in water is $1.58 \\times 10^{-3}$ moles per liter.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1.58 \\times 10^{-3}}",

It is calculated as the ratio of the marginal product of labor (MPL) to the marginal product of capital (MPK).\n\nStep 2: To find the MRTS of labor for capital, we need to first find the marginal products of labor and capital. The marginal product of labor (MPL) is the partial derivative of the production function with respect to labor (L), and the marginal product of capital (MPK) is the partial derivative of the production function with respect to capital (K).\n\nStep 3: The production function is given as $F(K, L)=(K-1)^{\\frac{1}{4}} L^{\\frac{1}{4}}$.

  "The condition which involves the SRAC is that the SRAC is at a minimum. This is the condition that the firm is at a capital level that minimizes its costs in the long-term. The SRAC is at a minimum when the marginal cost (MC) is equal to the average total cost (ATC). This is because the ATC is the sum of the fixed cost and the variable cost, and the variable cost is the product of the MC and the quantity produced. Therefore, when the MC is equal to the ATC, the variable cost is minimized, and the total cost is also minimized.

Specifically, it asks for the conditions involving the short-run average cost (SRAC) and the short-run marginal cost (SRMC).\n\n## Step 2: Identify the condition involving SRAC\nThe condition involving SRAC is that the firm is at a point where the short-run average cost (SRAC) equals the long-run average cost (LRAC).

The perturbing Hamiltonian is given by the off-diagonal elements of the matrix, which are $1, 2, 2$.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the zero-order eigenstates and their corresponding eigenvalues.\nThe zero-order eigenstates are the basis states $\\left| 10 \\right\\rangle$, $\\left| 0 \\right\\rangle$, and $\\left| -10 \\right\\rangle$, with corresponding eigenvalues $E^{(0)}=10, 0, -10$.\n\n## Step 3: Apply non-degenerate perturbation theory to derive the energy $E_{\\widetilde{10}}$.\nThe energy $E_{\\widetilde{10}}$ can be derived using non-degenerate perturbation theory, which states that the energy of the $n$th state is given by $E_n = E_n^{(0)} + \\sum_{m \\neq n} \\frac{\\left| \\left\\langle m \\right| H' \\left| n \\right\\rangle \\right|^2}{E_n^{(0)} - E_m^{(0)}}$, where $H'$ is the perturbing Hamiltonian.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the matrix elements of the perturbing Hamiltonian.\nThe matrix elements of the perturbing Hamiltonian are given by $\\left\\langle 10 \\right| H' \\left| 10 \\right\\rangle = 0$, $\\left\\langle 10 \\right| H' \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle = 1$, $\\left\\langle 10 \\right| H' \\left| -10 \\right\\rangle = 0$, $\\left\\langle 0 \\right| H' \\left| 10 \\right\\rangle = 1$, $\\left\\langle 0 \\right| H' \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle = 0$, $\\left\\langle 0 \\right| H' \\left| -10 \\right\\rangle = 2$, $\\left\\langle -10 \\right| H' \\left| 10 \\right\\rangle = 0$, $\\left\\langle -10 \\right| H' \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle = 2$, $\\left\\langle -10 \\right| H' \\left| -10 \\right\\rangle = 0$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the energy $E_{\\widetilde{10}}$ to second order in the perturbing Hamiltonian.\nThe energy $E_{\\widetilde{10}}$ can be calculated using the formula $E_{\\widetilde{10}} = E_{\\widetilde{10}}^{(0)} + \\frac{\\left| \\left\\langle 0 \\right| H' \\left| 10 \\right\\rangle \\right|^2}{E_{\\widetilde{10}}^{(0)} - E_0^{(0)}} + \\frac{\\left| \\left\\langle -10 \\right| H' \\left| 10 \\right\\rangle \\right|^2}{E_{\\widetilde{10}}^{(0)} - E_{-10}^{(0)}}$. Plugging in the values, we get $E_{\\widetilde{10}} = 10 + \\frac{\\left| 1 \\right|^2}{10 - 0} + \\frac{\\left| 2 \\right|^2}{10 - (-10)} = 10 + \\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{4}{20} = 10 + 0.1 + 0.2 = 10.3$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10.3}$"
