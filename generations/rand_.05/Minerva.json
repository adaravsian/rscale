  "Problem: A particular star has an absolute magnitude $M=-7$. If this star is observed in a galaxy that is at a distance of $3 \\mathrm{Mpc}$, what will its apparent magnitude be?\nStep 1:  To solve this problem, we need to use the relationship between absolute magnitude, apparent magnitude, and distance.\nStep 2:  The formula that connects these three quantities is: $m = M + 5 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{d}{10} \\right)$, where $m$ is the apparent magnitude, $M$ is the absolute magnitude, and $d$ is the distance in parsecs.\nStep 3:  Given that the absolute magnitude $M = -7$ and the distance $d = 3 \\mathrm{Mpc}$, we can substitute these values into the formula.\nStep 4:  First, we need to convert the distance from megaparsecs to parsecs.

  "## Step 1: Recall Snell's law\nSnell's law states that the ratio of the sines of the angles of incidence and refraction is equal to the ratio of the velocities of the two media, or equivalently, the inverse ratio of the indices of refraction. Mathematically, this can be expressed as $n_1 \\sin{\\theta_1} = n_2 \\sin{\\theta_2}$, where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the indices of refraction of the first and second media, respectively, and $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$ are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.\n\n## Step 2: Apply Snell's law to the given problem\nIn this problem, the light is incident on the surface of the water at an angle $\\theta_w$ with respect to the surface normal. The index of refraction of water is given as $n=1.3$. We want to find the angle of the light once it emerges from the water into the air, $\\theta_a$. Using Snell's law, we have $1.3 \\sin{\\theta_w} = \\sin{\\theta_a}$.\n\n## Step 3: Solve for $\\theta_a$\nTo find the expression for $\\theta_a$ in terms of $\\theta_w$, we can rearrange the equation from Step 2 to isolate $\\sin{\\theta_a}$. This gives us $\\sin{\\theta_a} = 1.3 \\sin{\\theta_w}$. To find $\\theta_a$, we take the inverse sine of both sides, which gives us $\\theta_a = \\arcsin{1.3 \\sin{\\theta_w}}$.\n\n## Step 4: Find the critical angle\nThe critical angle is the critical value of $\\theta_w$ such that the light will not emerge from the water. This occurs when $\\sin{\\theta_a} = 1$, since the sine of the angle of refraction is equal to 1 when the angle of refraction is 90 degrees. Using Snell's law, we have $1.3 \\sin{\\theta_w} = 1$. To find the critical angle, we can rearrange this equation to isolate $\\sin{\\theta_w}$, which gives us $\\sin{\\theta_w} = \\frac{1}{1.3}$. To find the critical angle, we take the inverse sine of both sides, which gives us $\\theta_w = \\arcsin{\\frac{1}{1.3}}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\arcsin{\\frac{1}{1.3}}}$",

Since $1 \\mathrm{~inch}=2.54 \\mathrm{~cm}$, the diameter in meters is $8 \\times 2.54 \\times 10^{-2} \\mathrm{~m}=0.2032 \\mathrm{~m}$.\nStep 3:  The wavelength of light in the visible spectrum is given as $5 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~m}$.\nStep 4:  Now, we can substitute these values into the Rayleigh criterion formula to find the limiting angular resolution.\nStep 5:  Plugging in the values, we get $\\theta=1.22 \\frac{5 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~m}}{0.2032 \\mathrm{~m}}$.\nStep 6:  Simplifying this expression, we find $\\theta=3.00 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~rad}$.\nStep 7:  To convert this to arcseconds, we use the conversion factor $1 \\mathrm{~rad} \\approx 206265 \\mathrm{~arcsec}$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the limiting angular resolution in arcseconds is $3.00 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~rad} \\times 206265 \\mathrm{~arcsec / rad} \\approx 0.0062 \\mathrm{~arcsec}$.\nStep 9:  Rounding to two significant figures, the limiting angular resolution is approximately $0.0062 \\mathrm{~arcsec}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0.0062}$",
  "Problem: A star has a measured parallax of $0.01^{\\prime \\prime}$, that is, $0.01$ arcseconds.

It is defined as the angle subtended at the star by the radius of the Earth's orbit around the Sun.\nStep 3:  The distance to the star in parsecs is the reciprocal of the parallax in arcseconds.

  "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the Bohr model of the atom and how it relates to the calculation of the wavelength of electron transitions.\n## Step 2:  The Bohr model describes the energy levels of an atom in terms of the principal quantum number, n. The energy of an electron in the nth level is given by the formula $E_n = -\\frac{13.6 \\, \\text{eV}}{n^2}$.\n## Step 3:  We are asked to find the wavelength of the transition from the $n=100$ to $n=99$ levels. This involves calculating the energy difference between these two levels and then using the formula for the wavelength of light emitted during a transition.\n## Step 4:  The energy difference between the two levels can be calculated as $\\Delta E = E_{100} - E_{99}$.\n## Step 5:  Substituting the values of $E_n$ into the formula, we get $\\Delta E = -\\frac{13.6 \\, \\text{eV}}{100^2} - \\left(-\\frac{13.6 \\, \\text{eV}}{99^2}\\right)$.\n## Step 6:  Simplifying this expression, we find $\\Delta E = -\\frac{13.6 \\, \\text{eV}}{10000} + \\frac{13.6 \\, \\text{eV}}{9801}$.\n## Step 7:  Further simplifying, we get $\\Delta E = -\\frac{13.6 \\, \\text{eV}}{10000} + \\frac{13.6 \\, \\text{eV}}{9801} = -1.36 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{eV} + 1.39 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{eV}$.\n## Step 8:  This gives us $\\Delta E = 3.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV}$.\n## Step 9:  Now, we can use the formula for the wavelength of light emitted during a transition, which is $\\lambda = \\frac{hc}{\\Delta E}$, where $h$ is Planck's constant, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\\Delta E$ is the energy difference between the two levels.\n## Step 10:  Substituting the values of $h$, $c$, and $\\Delta E$ into the formula, we get $\\lambda = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J s}) (3.00 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s})}{(3.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV})(1.60 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J/eV})}$.\n## Step 11:  Simplifying this expression, we find $\\lambda = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J s}) (3.00 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s})}{(3.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV})(1.60 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J/eV})} = 6.56 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{m}$.\n## Step 12:  Finally, we need to convert this wavelength from meters to centimeters by multiplying by 100, giving us $\\lambda = 6.56 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{cm}$.\n## Step 13:  Therefore, the wavelength of the transition from the $n=100$ to $n=99$ levels is $6.56 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{cm}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6.56 \\times 10^{-5}}",

  "Problem: If a star cluster is made up of $10^{4}$ stars, each of whose absolute magnitude is $-5$, compute the combined apparent magnitude of the cluster if it is located at a distance of $1 \\mathrm{Mpc}$. Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between absolute magnitude, apparent magnitude, and the distance to the star cluster.\nStep 2:  The absolute magnitude of a star is a measure of its intrinsic brightness, while the apparent magnitude is the brightness as seen from Earth. The distance modulus formula relates these two quantities: $m-M=5\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{d}{10\\mathrm{pc}}\\right)$, where $m$ is the apparent magnitude, $M$ is the absolute magnitude, and $d$ is the distance in parsecs.\nStep 3:  Given that the absolute magnitude of each star in the cluster is $-5$ and the cluster is located at a distance of $1 \\mathrm{Mpc}$, we first need to convert the distance to parsecs. Since $1 \\mathrm{Mpc} = 10^6 \\mathrm{pc}$, the distance to the cluster is $10^6 \\mathrm{pc}$.\nStep 4:  We can then use the distance modulus formula to find the apparent magnitude of the cluster.

  "Step 1:  To find the mean free path for collisions among stars, we need to consider the average distance a star travels before colliding with another star.\nStep 2:  We are given the density of stars in the globular star cluster as $10^{6} \\mathrm{pc}^{-3}$, where $1 \\mathrm{~pc} = 3.08 \\times 10^{18} \\mathrm{~cm}$.\nStep 3:  The average speed of the stars is given as $10 \\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{sec}^{-1}$, which we need to convert to $\\mathrm{cm} \\mathrm{sec}^{-1}$ for consistency with the units of the density.\nStep 4:  First, we convert the average speed from $\\mathrm{km} \\mathrm{sec}^{-1}$ to $\\mathrm{cm} \\mathrm{sec}^{-1}$ by multiplying by $10^5$, giving us $10^7 \\mathrm{~cm} \\mathrm{sec}^{-1}$.\nStep 5:  The mean free path for collisions among stars can be calculated using the formula $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2} \\pi n r^2}$, where $n$ is the number density of stars and $r$ is the radius of the stars.\nStep 6:  We are given that the stars have the same radius as the Sun, which is approximately $7 \\times 10^{10} \\mathrm{~cm}$.\nStep 7:  The number density of stars $n$ can be calculated from the given density of $10^{6} \\mathrm{pc}^{-3}$ by converting the units to $\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$.\nStep 8:  We have $n = 10^{6} \\mathrm{pc}^{-3} \\times \\frac{1 \\mathrm{~pc}}{3.08 \\times 10^{18} \\mathrm{~cm}} = 3.25 \\times 10^{-13} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$.\nStep 9:  Now, we can substitute the values of $n$ and $r$ into the formula for the mean free path $\\lambda$ to find the average distance a star travels before colliding with another star.\nStep 10:  Plugging in the values, we get $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2} \\pi (3.25 \\times 10^{-13} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3})(7 \\times 10^{10} \\mathrm{~cm})^2}$.\nStep 11:  Simplifying this expression, we find $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2} \\pi (3.25 \\times 10^{-13} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3})(49 \\times 10^{20} \\mathrm{~cm}^2)}$.\nStep 12:  Further simplifying, we get $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2} \\pi (1.60 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{~cm}^3)}$.\nStep 13:  Finally, evaluating the expression, we find $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2} \\pi (1.60 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{~cm}^3)} \\approx \\boxed{1.3 \\times 10^{8}}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1.3 \\times 10^{8}}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between absolute magnitude, apparent magnitude, and the distance to an object in astronomy.\nStep 2:  The absolute magnitude of an object is a measure of its intrinsic brightness, while the apparent magnitude is the brightness as seen from Earth. The difference between these two magnitudes is related to the distance to the object through the formula: $m - M = 5 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{d}{10} \\right)$, where $m$ is the apparent magnitude, $M$ is the absolute magnitude, and $d$ is the distance in parsecs.\nStep 3:  Given that the absolute magnitude of the star cluster is the same as that of the Sun, which is +5, and the distance to the cluster is 10 parsecs, we can use the formula to find the apparent magnitude of the cluster.\nStep 4:  Plugging in the values, we get: $m - 5 = 5 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{10}{10} \\right)$.

  "Step 1:  To find the collision mean free path, we first need to understand what it represents.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the apparent magnitude of a star and its distance from Earth, as well as its luminosity.\nStep 2:  The apparent magnitude of a star is related to its luminosity and distance from Earth through the formula: $m_1 - m_2 = -2.5 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{L_1}{L_2} \\cdot \\frac{d_2^2}{d_1^2} \\right)$, where $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the apparent magnitudes of the two stars, $L_1$ and $L_2$ are their luminosities, and $d_1$ and $d_2$ are their distances from Earth.\nStep 3:  Given that the two stars have the same surface temperature, their luminosities are proportional to the square of their radii. Therefore, if the radius of star 1 is $2.5$ times larger than the radius of star 2, its luminosity is $2.5^2 = 6.25$ times larger.\nStep 4:  Additionally, we are told that star 1 is ten times farther away than star 2. This means that the distance of star 1 is $10^2 = 100$ times larger than the distance of star 2.\nStep 5:  Substituting these values into the formula, we get: $m_1 - m_2 = -2.5 \\log_{10} \\left( 6.25 \\cdot \\frac{100^2}{1} \\right)$.\nStep 6:  Simplifying the expression inside the logarithm, we have: $m_1 - m_2 = -2.5 \\log_{10} (6.25 \\cdot 10000)$.\nStep 7:  Further simplifying, we get: $m_1 - m_2 = -2.5 \\log_{10} (62500)$.\nStep 8:  Evaluating the logarithm, we find: $m_1 - m_2 = -2.5 \\cdot 4.8$.\nStep 9:  Finally, calculating the value, we obtain: $m_1 - m_2 = -12$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the absolute value of the difference in apparent magnitude between the two stars is $|-12| = 12$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$",

  "Problem: Find the general (complex-valued) solution of the differential equation $\\dot{z}+2 z=e^{2 i t}$, using $C$ to stand for any complex-valued integration constants which may arise. Step 1:  To solve the differential equation $\\dot{z}+2 z=e^{2 i t}$, we first need to isolate the term involving $z$ on one side of the equation.\nStep 2:  We can do this by subtracting $e^{2 i t}$ from both sides of the equation, giving us $\\dot{z}+2 z-e^{2 i t}=0$.\nStep 3:  Next, we can use an integrating factor to simplify the equation.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of relative motion and how it applies to Manny's situation.\nStep 2:  Manny is running towards first base at a speed $\\beta$, and we want to find out how fast he is running relative to the speed of light, $c$.\nStep 3:  The key piece of information given is that Manny sees third base $45^{\\circ}$ to his left, which means he is experiencing a different perspective due to his motion.\nStep 4:  We can use the concept of the Lorentz transformation to relate Manny's speed to the speed of light. The Lorentz transformation for the x-component of velocity is given by $v_x' = \\frac{v_x - u}{1 - \\frac{uv_x}{c^2}}$, where $v_x'$ is the velocity in the moving frame, $v_x$ is the velocity in the stationary frame, $u$ is the relative velocity, and $c$ is the speed of light.\nStep 5:  In this case, Manny's velocity in the stationary frame is $v_x = \\beta c$, and the relative velocity is $u = \\beta c$ as well. We want to find the velocity in the moving frame, which is the velocity of third base as seen by Manny.\nStep 6:  Since Manny sees third base $45^{\\circ}$ to his left, the velocity of third base in the moving frame is $v_x' = \\frac{\\beta c - \\beta c}{1 - \\frac{\\beta c \\cdot \\beta c}{c^2}} = \\frac{0}{1 - \\beta^2} = 0$.\nStep 7:  However, this result doesn't make sense because Manny is clearly moving towards third base. The issue here is that the Lorentz transformation is not applicable in this scenario because Manny is not moving at a constant velocity relative to the third base.\nStep 8:  Instead, we can use the concept of the velocity addition formula, which states that the velocity of an object moving at a speed $v$ relative to an observer moving at a speed $u$ is given by $v' = \\frac{v - u}{1 - \\frac{uv}{c^2}}$.\nStep 9:  In this case, the velocity of third base as seen by Manny is $v' = \\frac{\\beta c - \\beta c}{1 - \\frac{\\beta c \\cdot \\beta c}{c^2}} = \\frac{0}{1 - \\beta^2} = 0$.\nStep 10:  However, this result is still incorrect because Manny is moving towards third base. The correct approach is to use the concept of the velocity addition formula, but with the correct signs for the velocities.\nStep 11:  The velocity of third base as seen by Manny is $v' = \\frac{\\beta c + \\beta c}{1 + \\frac{\\beta c \\cdot \\beta c}{c^2}} = \\frac{2\\beta c}{1 + \\beta^2}$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the speed at which Manny is running is $\\boxed{\\frac{2\\beta c}{1 + \\beta^2}}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{2\\beta c}{1 + \\beta^2}}$",
  "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given process and the approximations made.\nThe process $p+p+e^{-} \\rightarrow d+\\nu$ involves two protons and an electron colliding to produce a deuteron and a neutrino. We are approximating that the deuteron rest mass is $2m_{p}$, and the rest masses of the electron and neutrino are negligible compared to the proton rest mass $m_{p}$.\n\n## Step 2:  We are asked to calculate the energy $E_{\\nu}$ of the neutrino in the rest frame of the deuteron in terms of $\\theta, m_{p}$, and $\\gamma$.\nTo do this, we need to consider the energy and momentum of the particles involved in the collision.\n\n## Step 3:  In the lab frame, the two protons have the same energy $\\gamma m_{p}$ and impact angle $\\theta$, and the electron is at rest.\nWe can use the relativistic energy-momentum equation to find the energy and momentum of the protons.\n\n## Step 4:  The energy of each proton is given by $E_{p} = \\gamma m_{p}$, and the momentum of each proton is given by $p_{p} = \\gamma m_{p} \\sin \\theta$.\nWe can use these expressions to find the total energy and momentum of the two protons.\n\n## Step 5:  The total energy of the two protons is $E_{p} + E_{p} = 2 \\gamma m_{p}$, and the total momentum of the two protons is $p_{p} + p_{p} = 2 \\gamma m_{p} \\sin \\theta$.\n\n## Step 6:  In the rest frame of the deuteron, the total energy of the two protons is $E_{p} + E_{p} = 2 \\gamma m_{p}$, and the total momentum of the two protons is $p_{p} + p_{p} = 2 \\gamma m_{p} \\sin \\theta$.\n\n## Step 7:  Since the electron is at rest in the lab frame, its energy and momentum are negligible in the rest frame of the deuteron.\n\n## Step 8:  The energy of the neutrino in the rest frame of the deuteron is given by $E_{\\nu} = E_{p} + E_{p} - m_{d}$, where $m_{d}$ is the rest mass of the deuteron.\n\n## Step 9:  Since we are approximating that the deuteron rest mass is $2m_{p}$, we can substitute $m_{d} = 2m_{p}$ into the expression for $E_{\\nu}$.\n\n## Step 10:  Therefore, the energy of the neutrino in the rest frame of the deuteron is $E_{\\nu} = 2 \\gamma m_{p} - 2m_{p}$.\n\n## Step 11:  Simplifying the expression, we get $E_{\\nu} = 2 \\gamma m_{p} - 2m_{p} = 2(\\gamma - 1)m_{p}$.\n\n## Step 12:  Therefore, the energy of the neutrino in the rest frame of the deuteron is $E_{\\nu} = 2(\\gamma - 1)m_{p}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2(\\gamma - 1)m_{p}}$",

  "The age of the universe when most helium nuclei were formed is approximately 1 minute. This is because the universe was still in its early stages of formation, and the process of Big Bang nucleosynthesis was occurring. During this time, the universe was a hot and dense plasma, and the formation of helium nuclei was a key process. The age of the universe at this time is estimated to be around 1 minute, which is the time it took for the universe to cool enough for helium nuclei to form.\n\nThe age of the universe when hydrogen atoms formed is a different story. Hydrogen atoms formed much later in the universe's history, during the era of recombination. This occurred when the universe had cooled enough for electrons and protons to combine into neutral atoms. The age of the universe at this time is estimated to be around 380,000 years.\n\nTherefore, the age of the universe when hydrogen atoms formed is approximately 380,000 years. This is a much longer time period than the 1 minute it took for helium nuclei to form.\n\nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{380000}",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the energy of the photon and the energy levels of the hydrogen atom.\nStep 2:  The energy of a photon is given by the formula $E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$, where $h$ is Planck's constant, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of the photon.\nStep 3:  We are given that the wavelength of the photon is $\\lambda = 4.28 \\times 10^{-7} {~m}$.\nStep 4:  The energy of the photon can be calculated using the given wavelength and the values of Planck's constant and the speed of light.\nStep 5:  Once we have the energy of the photon, we need to find the energy level of the hydrogen atom that corresponds to this energy.\nStep 6:  The energy levels of the hydrogen atom are given by the formula $E_n = -\\frac{13.6}{n^2} {~eV}$, where $n$ is the principal quantum number.\nStep 7:  We need to find the value of $n$ that corresponds to the energy of the photon.\nStep 8:  Once we have the energy level of the hydrogen atom, we can calculate the velocity of the electron after interaction using the formula $v = \\sqrt{\\frac{2E}{m_e}}$, where $E$ is the energy of the photon and $m_e$ is the mass of the electron.\nStep 9:  We will use the given values of Planck's constant, the speed of light, and the mass of the electron to calculate the velocity of the electron.\nStep 10:  Finally, we will express the velocity in the required format as $n \\times 10^x$ where $n$ is to 2 decimal places.\n\nStep 11:  First, let's calculate the energy of the photon using the given wavelength.\nStep 12:  The energy of the photon is given by $E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$.\nStep 13:  Substituting the given values, we get $E = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} {~Js})(3 \\times 10^8 {~m/s})}{4.28 \\times 10^{-7} {~m}}$.\nStep 14:  Simplifying this expression, we get $E = 4.65 \\times 10^{-19} {~J}$.\n\nStep 15:  Next, we need to find the energy level of the hydrogen atom that corresponds to this energy.\nStep 16:  We can do this by equating the energy of the photon to the energy level of the hydrogen atom and solving for $n$.\nStep 17:  The energy level of the hydrogen atom is given by $E_n = -\\frac{13.6}{n^2} {~eV}$.\nStep 18:  Equating this to the energy of the photon, we get $4.65 \\times 10^{-19} {~J} = -\\frac{13.6}{n^2} {~eV}$.\nStep 19:  Solving for $n$, we get $n = 2$.\n\nStep 20:  Now that we have the energy level of the hydrogen atom, we can calculate the velocity of the electron after interaction.\nStep 21:  The velocity of the electron is given by $v = \\sqrt{\\frac{2E}{m_e}}$.\nStep 22:  Substituting the values, we get $v = \\sqrt{\\frac{2(4.65 \\times 10^{-19} {~J})}{9.11 \\times 10^{-31} {~kg}}}$.\nStep 23:  Simplifying this expression, we get $v = 2.19 \\times 10^6 {~m/s}$.\n\nStep 24:  Therefore, the velocity of the electron after interaction is $2.19 \\times 10^6 {~m/s}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2.19 \\times 10^6}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to use Bragg's Law, which relates the wavelength of the radiation, the interplanar spacing of the crystal lattice, and the angle of diffraction.\nStep 2:  First, we need to identify the given information: the wavelength of the $L_{\\alpha}$ radiation from tungsten, which is $\\lambda = 0.071 \\, \\text{nm}$, and the interplanar spacing for the $4^{\\text {th }}$ reflection of thorium, which is $d = 0.317 \\, \\text{nm}$.\nStep 3:  Bragg's Law is given by the equation $2d \\sin \\theta = n \\lambda$, where $d$ is the interplanar spacing, $\\theta$ is the angle of diffraction, $n$ is the order of the reflection, and $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of the radiation.\nStep 4:  We are given that $n = 4$, $\\lambda = 0.071 \\, \\text{nm}$, and $d = 0.317 \\, \\text{nm}$.\nStep 5:  We can rearrange Bragg's Law to solve for $\\sin \\theta$: $\\sin \\theta = \\frac{n \\lambda}{2d}$.\nStep 6:  Substituting the given values, we get $\\sin \\theta = \\frac{4 \\times 0.071 \\, \\text{nm}}{2 \\times 0.317 \\, \\text{nm}}$.\nStep 7:  Calculating the value of $\\sin \\theta$, we find $\\sin \\theta = \\frac{0.284 \\, \\text{nm}}{0.634 \\, \\text{nm}} = 0.448$.\nStep 8:  To find the angle $\\theta$, we take the inverse sine of $0.448$, which gives us $\\theta = \\sin^{-1}(0.448)$.\nStep 9:  Using a calculator, we find that $\\theta \\approx 26.74^{\\circ}$.\nStep 10:  Rounding this value to 2 decimal places, we get $\\theta \\approx 26.74^{\\circ}$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the angle of the $4^{\\text {th }}$ reflection is approximately $26.74^{\\circ}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{26.74}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given information and what is being asked. We are dealing with a metal that has a Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) structure, a lattice constant of $3.31 \\AA$, and a density of $16.6 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{cm}^{3}$.\nStep 2:  The first step is to calculate the volume of the unit cell. The lattice constant is given as $3.31 \\AA$, which is equivalent to $3.31 \\times 10^{-8} \\mathrm{~cm}$.\nStep 3:  The volume of the unit cell for a BCC structure is given by the formula $V = a^3$, where $a$ is the lattice constant. Substituting the given value, we get $V = (3.31 \\times 10^{-8} \\mathrm{~cm})^3$.\nStep 4:  Next, we need to calculate the mass of the unit cell. The density of the metal is given as $16.6 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{cm}^{3}$, and the volume of the unit cell is calculated as $V = (3.31 \\times 10^{-8} \\mathrm{~cm})^3$. Using the formula for density, $\\rho = \\frac{m}{V}$, we can rearrange it to find the mass of the unit cell as $m = \\rho \\times V$.\nStep 5:  Substituting the given density and the calculated volume, we get $m = 16.6 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{cm}^{3} \\times (3.31 \\times 10^{-8} \\mathrm{~cm})^3$.\nStep 6:  After calculating the mass of the unit cell, we need to find the number of atoms in the unit cell. For a BCC structure, there are 2 atoms per unit cell.\nStep 7:  Finally, we can calculate the atomic weight of the element by dividing the mass of the unit cell by the number of atoms in the unit cell and then multiplying by Avogadro's number ($6.022 \\times 10^{23}$ atoms/mole).\nStep 8:  This will give us the atomic weight of the element in g/mole, which we need to round to 1 decimal place.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{63.1}$",
  "Step 1:  To find the radius of an iron atom in the BCC unit cell, we first need to understand the relationship between the edge length of the unit cell and the radius of the atom.\nStep 2:  The BCC unit cell has a relationship between the edge length (a) and the radius (r) of the atom given by the equation: $a = \\frac{4r}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\nStep 3:  We are given the density of iron as $\\rho = 7.86 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ and the mass of the unit cell as $M = 2 \\times 55.85 \\mathrm{~g}$ (since there are 2 atoms in the BCC unit cell).\nStep 4:  We can use the formula for density to find the volume of the unit cell: $\\rho = \\frac{M}{V}$, where $V$ is the volume of the unit cell.\nStep 5:  Rearranging the formula to solve for volume, we get: $V = \\frac{M}{\\rho}$.\nStep 6:  Substituting the given values, we find: $V = \\frac{2 \\times 55.85 \\mathrm{~g}}{7.86 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{cm}^{3}} = 14.2 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.\nStep 7:  Now that we have the volume of the unit cell, we can use the relationship between the edge length and the radius to find the radius of the iron atom.\nStep 8:  We can rearrange the equation $a = \\frac{4r}{\\sqrt{3}}$ to solve for $r$: $r = \\frac{\\sqrt{3} a}{4}$.\nStep 9:  Substituting the value of $a$ from the volume of the unit cell, we get: $r = \\frac{\\sqrt{3} \\times \\sqrt[3]{14.2 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3}}}{4}$.\nStep 10:  Evaluating the expression, we find the radius of the iron atom to be $r = \\frac{\\sqrt{3} \\times \\sqrt[3]{14.2 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3}}}{4} = 1.24 \\times 10^{-8} \\mathrm{~cm}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1.24 \\times 10^{-8}}",

  "Problem: Determine the wavelength of $\\lambda_{K_{\\alpha}}$ for molybdenum (Mo). Please format your answer as $n \\times 10^x$ where $n$ is to 2 decimal places, in meters.\nStep 1:  To find the wavelength of $\\lambda_{K_{\\alpha}}$ for molybdenum (Mo), we first need to understand what $\\lambda_{K_{\\alpha}}$ represents. It is the wavelength of the characteristic X-ray emitted when an electron transitions from the K shell to the L shell in the atom of a particular element.\nStep 2:  The energy of the X-ray emitted is given by the difference in energy between the two shells. We can calculate this energy using the formula $E = 13.6 \\, \\text{eV} \\times Z^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{n_1^2} - \\frac{1}{n_2^2} \\right)$, where $Z$ is the atomic number of the element, and $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the principal quantum numbers of the shells involved in the transition.\nStep 3:  For molybdenum, the atomic number $Z = 42$. The transition from the K shell ($n_1 = 1$) to the L shell ($n_2 = 2$) gives us the energy of the X-ray emitted.\nStep 4:  Substituting these values into the formula, we get $E = 13.6 \\, \\text{eV} \\times 42^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{1^2} - \\frac{1}{2^2} \\right) = 13.6 \\, \\text{eV} \\times 1764 \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{4} \\right) = 13.6 \\, \\text{eV} \\times 1764 \\left( \\frac{3}{4} \\right) = 13.6 \\, \\text{eV} \\times 1323 = 17973.8 \\, \\text{eV}$.\nStep 5:  To find the wavelength, we use the formula $\\lambda = \\frac{hc}{E}$, where $h$ is Planck's constant, $c$ is the speed of light, and $E$ is the energy of the X-ray.\nStep 6:  Substituting the values, we get $\\lambda = \\frac{6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J s} \\times 3.00 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s}}{17973.8 \\, \\text{eV} \\times 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J/eV}} = \\frac{19.878 \\times 10^{-26} \\, \\text{J m}}{28.83 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\text{J}} = 0.688 \\times 10^{-10} \\, \\text{m}$.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the wavelength of $\\lambda_{K_{\\alpha}}$ for molybdenum (Mo) is $0.69 \\times 10^{-10} \\, \\text{m}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0.69 \\times 10^{-10}}",

  "The working temperature for silica glass is typically around 1000\u00b0C. This is because silica glass has a high melting point and can withstand high temperatures without deforming or losing its shape. However, it's worth noting that the exact working temperature can vary depending on the specific application and the type of silica glass being used. In general, silica glass is used in high-temperature applications such as furnace windows, heat exchangers, and refractory components. \n\n\\boxed{1000}",

The interplanar spacing can be calculated using the formula $d_{hkl} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2}}$, where $a$ is the lattice parameter of gold and $h, k, l$ are the Miller indices of the plane.\nStep 3:  The lattice parameter of gold is $a = 4.078 \\times 10^{-10} \\, \\mathrm{m}$.\nStep 4:  For the $\\{220\\}$ plane, $h = 2, k = 2, l = 0$.

  "Step 1:  To find the equilibrium price in the apple juice market, we need to first understand the given supply and demand curves. The supply curve is represented by the equation $Q_{S} = 10P_{J} - 5P_{A}$, where $Q_{S}$ is the quantity supplied, $P_{J}$ is the price of apple juice, and $P_{A}$ is the price of apples. We are given that $P_{A}$ is fixed at $\\$ 1$. The demand curve is represented by the equation $Q_{D} = 100 - 15P_{J} + 10P_{T}$, where $Q_{D}$ is the quantity demanded, $P_{J}$ is the price of apple juice, and $P_{T}$ is the price of tea, which is given as $\\$ 5$.\nStep 2:  We are asked to find the equilibrium price in the apple juice market, which occurs when the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded. This can be represented by the equation $Q_{S} = Q_{D}$.\nStep 3:  Substituting the given values into the supply and demand equations, we get $10P_{J} - 5(1) = 100 - 15P_{J} + 10(5)$.\nStep 4:  Simplifying this equation, we have $10P_{J} - 5 = 100 - 15P_{J} + 50$.\nStep 5:  Combining like terms, we get $10P_{J} + 15P_{J} = 100 + 50 + 5$.\nStep 6:  This simplifies to $25P_{J} = 155$.\nStep 7:  To solve for $P_{J}$, we divide both sides by 25, giving us $P_{J} = \\frac{155}{25}$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the equilibrium price in the apple juice market is $\\$ 6.20$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6.2}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to determine the price at which the city of Cambridge should set the price of apples within its borders.\nStep 2:  We are given that the local orchard can produce up to 50 apples per day at a constant marginal cost of 25 cents per apple, and the store can supply any remaining apples demanded at a constant marginal cost of 75 cents per unit.\nStep 3:  When apples cost 75 cents per apple, the residents of Cambridge buy 150 apples in a day. This information gives us a starting point to work with.\nStep 4:  Let's denote the price at which the city should set the price of apples as $p$ cents. We want to find the value of $p$.\nStep 5:  We know that at a price of 75 cents, the demand for apples is 150. This means that the quantity of apples demanded is 150.\nStep 6:  Since the local orchard can produce up to 50 apples per day, the remaining apples demanded must come from the store. Therefore, the quantity of apples supplied by the store is $150 - 50 = 100$.\nStep 7:  The marginal cost of the store is 75 cents per unit, so the total cost of supplying 100 apples is $100 \\times 75 = 7500$ cents.\nStep 8:  Now, we need to find the price at which the city should set the price of apples. This price should be such that the quantity of apples demanded is 150, and the total cost of supplying these apples is minimized.\nStep 9:  To find this price, we can use the fact that the marginal cost of the orchard is 25 cents per apple, and the marginal cost of the store is 75 cents per apple.\nStep 10:  We can set up an equation to represent the situation: $50 \\times 25 + (150 - 50) \\times 75 = 150p$.\nStep 11:  Solving for $p$, we get $p = \\frac{50 \\times 25 + 100 \\times 75}{150} = \\frac{1250 + 7500}{150} = \\frac{8750}{150} = 58.33$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the city of Cambridge should set the price of apples at 58.33 cents.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{58.33}$",

Since MC(4) = 4 and ATC(4) = 4, it indicates that the firm is already producing at the lowest point of the ATC curve, which means that the profit-maximizing output is 4.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the tax amount is the difference between the price and the ATC at the profit-maximizing output, which is $\\$10 - \\$4 = \\$6$ per can.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$",

We can rearrange this formula to get $\\frac{dP}{dX_{d}} = -\\frac{0.25P}{X_{d}}$.\nStep 7:  We also know that $\\frac{dP}{dX_{d}} = -b$, so we can substitute this into the previous equation to get $-b = -\\frac{0.25P}{X_{d}}$.\nStep 8:  Solving for $b$, we get $b = \\frac{0.25P}{X_{d}}$.\nStep 9:  We can substitute the given values of $P = 20$ and $X_{d} = 100$ into the equation for $b$ to find its value.\nStep 10:  Substituting these values, we get $b = \\frac{0.25 \\cdot 20}{100} = 0.005$.\nStep 11:  Now that we have the value of $b$, we can use the demand equation $P = a - bX_{d}$ and the given values of $P = 20$ and $X_{d} = 100$ to find the value of $a$.\nStep 12:  Substituting these values into the demand equation, we get $20 = a - 0.005 \\cdot 100$, which simplifies to $20 = a - 0.5$.\nStep 13:  Solving for $a$, we get $a = 20 + 0.5 = 20.5$.\nStep 14:  Therefore, the equation of demand in this market is $P = 20.5 - 0.005X_{d}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{20.5 - 0.005X_{d}}$",
