  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of relative motion and how to calculate the time it takes for Alicia and Beth to meet.\nStep 2:  First, we note that the distance between Cities $A$ and $B$ is $45$ miles. Alicia bikes towards $B$ at a speed of $18$ miles per hour, while Beth bikes towards $A$ at a speed of $12$ miles per hour.\nStep 3:  When they meet, the sum of the distances traveled by Alicia and Beth will be equal to the total distance between the cities, which is $45$ miles.\nStep 4:  Let's denote the time it takes for them to meet as $t$ hours. In this time, Alicia will have traveled a distance of $18t$ miles, and Beth will have traveled a distance of $12t$ miles.\nStep 5:  Since the sum of their distances traveled is equal to the total distance between the cities, we can set up the equation $18t + 12t = 45$ to represent this situation.\nStep 6:  Solving for $t$, we get $30t = 45$, which gives us $t = \\frac{45}{30} = \\frac{3}{2}$ hours.\nStep 7:  Now that we have the time it takes for them to meet, we can calculate the distance from City $A$ where they will meet. This distance is the distance traveled by Alicia in the time $t$, which is $18t = 18 \\times \\frac{3}{2} = 27$ miles.\nStep 8:  Therefore, when Alicia and Beth meet, they will be $27$ miles from City $A$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{27}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given equations and use algebraic manipulations to find the values of $x$ and $y$.\nStep 2:  We are given two equations: $y^3=x^2$ and $(y-x)^2=4y^2$. Our goal is to find the value of $x+y$.\nStep 3:  Let's start by examining the second equation, $(y-x)^2=4y^2$. Expanding this equation gives us $y^2-2xy+x^2=4y^2$.\nStep 4:  Rearranging the terms, we get $x^2-2xy-3y^2=0$. This is a quadratic equation in terms of $x$, and we can solve for $x$ using the quadratic formula.\nStep 5:  The quadratic formula states that for an equation of the form $ax^2+bx+c=0$, the solutions are given by $x=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$.\nStep 6:  Applying this to our equation $x^2-2xy-3y^2=0$, we have $a=1$, $b=-2y$, and $c=-3y^2$. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula gives us $x=\\frac{2y\\pm\\sqrt{(-2y)^2-4(1)(-3y^2)}}{2(1)}$.\nStep 7:  Simplifying the expression under the square root, we get $x=\\frac{2y\\pm\\sqrt{4y^2+12y^2}}{2}$, which further simplifies to $x=\\frac{2y\\pm\\sqrt{16y^2}}{2}$.\nStep 8:  This gives us $x=\\frac{2y\\pm4y}{2}$. So, we have two possible values for $x$: $x=3y$ or $x=-y$.\nStep 9:  Now, we need to consider the first equation, $y^3=x^2$. We can substitute the two possible values of $x$ into this equation to find the corresponding values of $y$.\nStep 10:  If $x=3y$, then $y^3=(3y)^2$, which simplifies to $y^3=9y^2$. Dividing both sides by $y^2$ gives us $y=9$.\nStep 11:  If $x=-y$, then $y^3=(-y)^2$, which simplifies to $y^3=y^2$. Dividing both sides by $y^2$ gives us $y=1$.\nStep 12:  Now that we have the values of $y$, we can find the corresponding values of $x$ using the equations $x=3y$ and $x=-y$.\nStep 13:  If $y=9$, then $x=3y=3(9)=27$. If $y=1$, then $x=-y=-1$.\nStep 14:  Therefore, the possible pairs of $(x,y)$ are $(27,9)$ and $(-1,1)$.\nStep 15:  Finally, we need to find the value of $x+y$ for each pair. For $(27,9)$, we have $x+y=27+9=36$. For $(-1,1)$, we have $x+y=-1+1=0$.\nStep 16:  So, the possible values of $x+y$ are $36$ and $0$.\nStep 17:  However, we need to check if both solutions satisfy the original equations. Substituting $(27,9)$ into the original equations, we find that it satisfies both equations. Substituting $(-1,1)$ into the original equations, we find that it does not satisfy the second equation.\nStep 18:  Therefore, the only valid solution is $(27,9)$, and the value of $x+y$ is $\\boxed{36}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{36}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to carefully examine the given expression and look for a pattern or a way to simplify it.\nStep 2:  The expression involves a series of cubes of consecutive numbers, with alternating addition and subtraction. We can start by expanding the first few terms to see if a pattern emerges.\nStep 3:  The given expression is $2^3 - 1^3 + 4^3 - 3^3 + 6^3 - 5^3 + \\dots + 18^3 - 17^3.$\nStep 4:  Expanding the first few terms, we get: $2^3 - 1^3 + 4^3 - 3^3 + 6^3 - 5^3 + 8^3 - 7^3 + 10^3 - 9^3 + 12^3 - 11^3 + 14^3 - 13^3 + 16^3 - 15^3 + 18^3 - 17^3.$\nStep 5:  Upon examining the expanded terms, we notice that each pair of consecutive terms can be simplified using the difference of cubes factorization: $a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2).$\nStep 6:  Applying this factorization to each pair of terms, we get: $(2 - 1)(2^2 + 2 \\cdot 1 + 1^2) + (4 - 3)(4^2 + 4 \\cdot 3 + 3^2) + (6 - 5)(6^2 + 6 \\cdot 5 + 5^2) + \\dots + (18 - 17)(18^2 + 18 \\cdot 17 + 17^2).$\nStep 7:  Simplifying each pair of terms using the factorization, we get: $1(4 + 2 + 1) + 1(16 + 12 + 9) + 1(36 + 30 + 25) + \\dots + 1(324 + 306 + 289).$\nStep 8:  Further simplifying, we get: $7 + 37 + 91 + \\dots + 919.$\nStep 9:  Now, we can see that the terms form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 30. We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence to find the sum of the terms.\nStep 10:  The formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence is $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n),$ where $S_n$ is the sum of the first $n$ terms, $a_1$ is the first term, and $a_n$ is the last term.\nStep 11:  In this case, the first term is 7, the last term is 919, and the common difference is 30. We can use the formula to find the sum of the terms.\nStep 12:  Plugging in the values, we get: $S_n = \\frac{30}{2}(7 + 919) = 15(926) = 13950.$\nStep 13:  Therefore, the value of the given expression is $\\boxed{13950}.$\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{13950}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given information and set up equations to represent the relationships between the number of games won by left-handed and right-handed players.\nStep 2:  Let's denote the number of left-handed players as $L$ and the number of right-handed players as $R$. We are given that there are twice as many right-handed players as left-handed players, so we can express this as $R = 2L$.\nStep 3:  The total number of games played can be calculated using the combination formula, which is given by $\\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$, where $n$ is the total number of participants. In this case, the total number of participants is $L + R$, and the total number of games played is $\\frac{(L+R)(L+R-1)}{2}$.\nStep 4:  We are also given that the number of games won by left-handed players was $40\\%$ more than the number of games won by right-handed players. This can be expressed as $1.4R = L$.\nStep 5:  We can use these two equations to solve for the values of $L$ and $R$.\nStep 6:  Substituting $R = 2L$ into the equation $1.4R = L$, we get $1.4(2L) = L$, which simplifies to $2.8L = L$. This implies that $L = 0$, which is not a valid solution as it would mean there are no left-handed players.\nStep 7:  Therefore, we need to re-examine our approach and consider the relationship between the number of games won by left-handed and right-handed players.\nStep 8:  Let's assume that the number of games won by right-handed players is $x$. Then, the number of games won by left-handed players is $1.4x$.\nStep 9:  The total number of games played is the sum of the games won by left-handed and right-handed players, which is $x + 1.4x = 2.4x$.\nStep 10:  We also know that the total number of games played is equal to the total number of participants, which is $L + R$. Since $R = 2L$, we can express this as $L + 2L = 3L$.\nStep 11:  Equating the two expressions for the total number of games played, we get $2.4x = 3L$.\nStep 12:  We also know that the total number of games played is equal to the combination of the total number of participants taken 2 at a time, which is $\\frac{(L+R)(L+R-1)}{2} = \\frac{(3L)(3L-1)}{2}$.\nStep 13:  Equating this expression to $2.4x$, we get $\\frac{(3L)(3L-1)}{2} = 2.4x$.\nStep 14:  Solving for $x$, we find that $x = \\frac{3L(3L-1)}{4.8}$.\nStep 15:  Since $x$ represents the number of games won by right-handed players, it must be an integer. Therefore, we need to find the smallest value of $L$ such that $x$ is an integer.\nStep 16:  By trial and error, we find that $L = 4$ satisfies this condition, giving us $x = 14$.\nStep 17:  Finally, we can calculate the total number of games played by substituting $L = 4$ and $R = 2L = 8$ into the expression for the total number of games played, which is $\\frac{(L+R)(L+R-1)}{2} = \\frac{(4+8)(4+8-1)}{2} = \\frac{12 \\cdot 11}{2} = 66$.\nStep 18:  Therefore, the total number of games played is $\\boxed{66}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{66}$",

This implies that the total sum of her quiz scores will be $nx + 33$.\nStep 5:  We can set up an equation based on this information: $nx + 11 = (n+3)(x+2)$.\nStep 6:  Expanding the right-hand side of the equation, we get $nx + 11 = nx + 2n + 3x + 6$.\nStep 7:  Simplifying the equation, we get $11 = 2n + 3x + 6$.\nStep 8:  Rearranging the terms, we have $5 = 2n + 3x$.\nStep 9:  We are also given that $n \\ge 4$, which means that $2n \\ge 8$.\nStep 10:  Since $2n + 3x = 5$, we can conclude that $3x \\le -3$.\nStep 11:  This implies that $x \\le -1$.\nStep 12:  However, we know that the mean of her quiz scores cannot be negative, so we must have $x \\ge 0$.\nStep 13:  Therefore, we can conclude that $0 \\le x \\le -1$.\nStep 14:  However, this is a contradiction, as the mean of her quiz scores cannot be both non-negative and negative at the same time.\nStep 15:  This means that our initial assumption that $n \\ge 4$ must be incorrect.\nStep 16:  Therefore, we must have $n < 4$, which implies that $n = 3$.\nStep 17:  Substituting $n = 3$ into the equation $5 = 2n + 3x$, we get $5 = 6 + 3x$.\nStep 18:  Solving for $x$, we find that $x = -\\frac{1}{3}$.\nStep 19:  However, this is not a valid solution, as the mean of her quiz scores cannot be a fraction.\nStep 20:  Therefore, we must have $n = 2$.\nStep 21:  Substituting $n = 2$ into the equation $5 = 2n + 3x$, we get $5 = 4 + 3x$.\nStep 22:  Solving for $x$, we find that $x = \\frac{1}{3}$.\nStep 23:  However, this is not a valid solution, as the mean of her quiz scores cannot be a fraction.\nStep 24:  Therefore, we must have $n = 1$.\nStep 25:  Substituting $n = 1$ into the equation $5 = 2n + 3x$, we get $5 = 2 + 3x$.\nStep 26:  Solving for $x$, we find that $x = \\frac{3}{3} = 1$.\nStep 27:  Therefore, the mean of her quiz scores currently is $\\boxed{1}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the situation and what is being asked. Mrs. Jones has four identical glasses, and she fills the first three glasses completely but only fills the fourth glass $\\frac{1}{3}$ full due to running out of juice.\nStep 2:  The goal is to find the fraction of a glass that Mrs. Jones must pour from each of the first three glasses into the fourth glass so that all four glasses will have the same amount of juice.\nStep 3:  Let's assume that the amount of juice in each of the first three glasses is represented by the variable $x$. Therefore, the total amount of juice in the first three glasses is $3x$.\nStep 4:  Since the fourth glass is only $\\frac{1}{3}$ full, the amount of juice in it is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\nStep 5:  To make all four glasses have the same amount of juice, we need to find the amount of juice that should be poured from each of the first three glasses into the fourth glass.\nStep 6:  This can be represented by the equation $3x - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{4}(3x + \\frac{1}{3})$, where $\\frac{1}{4}(3x + \\frac{1}{3})$ represents the total amount of juice in all four glasses after pouring.\nStep 7:  Solving this equation will give us the value of $x$, which represents the amount of juice in each of the first three glasses.\nStep 8:  Once we have the value of $x$, we can find the fraction of a glass that Mrs. Jones must pour from each of the first three glasses into the fourth glass.\nStep 9:  The fraction of a glass to be poured is given by $\\frac{1}{3} - x$, and we need to find the sum of the numerator and denominator of this fraction.\nStep 10:  Therefore, our final answer will be the sum of the numerator and denominator of the fraction $\\frac{1}{3} - x$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first understand the given scenario. We have two circles, one with a radius of $4$ and the other with a radius of $10$. The center of the first circle lies on the positive $x$-axis and is tangent to the $y$-axis at the origin, while the center of the second circle lies on the positive $y$-axis and is tangent to the $x$-axis at the origin.\nStep 2:  We are asked to find the slope of the line passing through the two points at which these circles intersect.\nStep 3:  Let's denote the center of the smaller circle as $A$ and the center of the larger circle as $B$. We can then find the coordinates of these centers based on the given information.\nStep 4:  The center of the smaller circle, $A$, is located at $(4,0)$, and the center of the larger circle, $B$, is located at $(0,10)$.\nStep 5:  We can then find the points of intersection, $C$ and $D$, of the two circles by considering the equations of the circles and solving for the points of intersection.\nStep 6:  The equation of the smaller circle is $(x-4)^2 + y^2 = 16$, and the equation of the larger circle is $x^2 + (y-10)^2 = 100$.\nStep 7:  By solving these equations simultaneously, we can find the coordinates of points $C$ and $D$.\nStep 8:  Once we have the coordinates of points $C$ and $D$, we can find the slope of the line passing through these points using the formula for slope.\nStep 9:  The slope of the line passing through points $C$ and $D$ is given by $\\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$, where $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ are the coordinates of the two points.\nStep 10:  After finding the slope, we can then add the numerator and denominator of the slope to obtain the final answer.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{29}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum area of an isosceles trapezoid with legs of length $1$ and one base twice as long as the other.\nStep 2:  Let's denote the length of the shorter base as $x$. Then, the length of the longer base is $2x$.\nStep 3:  We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height of the trapezoid. The height is the altitude from the shorter base to the longer base, and it forms a right-angled triangle with the leg of the trapezoid and half the difference between the bases.\nStep 4:  Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have $h^2 = 1 - \\left( \\frac{2x - x}{2} \\right)^2 = 1 - \\left( \\frac{x}{2} \\right)^2 = 1 - \\frac{x^2}{4} = \\frac{4 - x^2}{4}$.\nStep 5:  The area of the trapezoid is given by the formula $A = \\frac{h}{2} (a + b)$, where $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the bases and $h$ is the height.\nStep 6:  Substituting the values, we get $A = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{2}{4} \\cdot (x + 2x) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{2}{4} \\cdot 3x = \\frac{3x}{4}$.\nStep 7:  To find the maximum area, we need to maximize the expression $\\frac{3x}{4}$.\nStep 8:  Since the expression is linear in $x$, the maximum area will occur when $x$ is at its maximum value.\nStep 9:  The maximum value of $x$ can be found by considering the right triangle formed by the leg of the trapezoid and half the difference between the bases.\nStep 10:  The maximum value of $x$ is when the right triangle is a 45-45-90 triangle, which occurs when $x = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{2}$.\nStep 11:  Substituting this value of $x$ into the expression for the area, we get $A = \\frac{3 \\sqrt{2}}{4}$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the maximum area of the trapezoid is $\\frac{3 \\sqrt{2}}{4}$.\nStep 13:  To find $m^2 + n^2$, we need to find the square of the numerator and the square of the denominator and add them together.\nStep 14:  The square of the numerator is $3^2 = 9$ and the square of the denominator is $2^2 = 4$.\nStep 15:  Adding them together, we get $9 + 4 = 13$.\nStep 16:  Therefore, $m^2 + n^2 = 13$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{13}$",

We need to determine the value of the most expensive item that cannot be purchased using these coins with exact change.\nStep 3:  The problem can be approached by considering the concept of linear combinations and the Frobenius coin problem. The Frobenius coin problem states that if we have coins of values $a$ and $b$ that are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1), then the largest amount that cannot be obtained using these coins is $ab - a - b$.\nStep 4:  However, in this case, we have three coin values: $6, 10,$ and $15$. We need to check if the values $6$ and $10$ are coprime, and if so, we can use the Frobenius coin problem to find the largest amount that cannot be obtained using these two coins.\nStep 5:  If $6$ and $10$ are coprime, then the largest amount that cannot be obtained using these two coins is $6 \\cdot 10 - 6 - 10 = 44$ cents.\nStep 6:  However, we need to check if this value can be obtained using the third coin value of $15$ cents. If it can be obtained, then the largest amount that cannot be obtained using all three coins is less than $44$ cents.\nStep 7:  We can check if $44$ cents can be obtained by finding the remainder when $44$ is divided by $15$. If the remainder is $0$, then $44$ cents can be obtained using the $15$-cent coin.\nStep 8:  If the remainder is not $0$, then $44$ cents cannot be obtained using the $15$-cent coin, and the largest amount that cannot be obtained using all three coins is $44$ cents.\nStep 9:  We can calculate the remainder by dividing $44$ by $15$, which gives a remainder of $4$.

This information can be used to apply the Law of Cosines to find the value of $d$.\nStep 4:  The Law of Cosines states that for a triangle with side lengths $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ opposite to angles $A,$ $B,$ and $C$ respectively, we have $c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cos C$.\nStep 5:  Applying this to triangle $ABC$, we get $(6+2d)^2 = 6^2 + (6+d)^2 - 2 \\cdot 6 \\cdot (6+d) \\cos 120^\\circ$.\nStep 6:  Simplifying this equation, we get $36 + 24d + 4d^2 = 36 + 36 + 12d + d^2 - 6(6+d)$.\nStep 7:  Further simplifying, we get $4d^2 + 24d = 12d + d^2 - 36 - 6d$.\nStep 8:  Rearranging the terms, we get $3d^2 + 18d - 36 = 0$.\nStep 9:  We can solve this quadratic equation to find the value of $d$.\nStep 10:  Once we have the value of $d$, we can find the side lengths of the triangle and then use the formula for the area of a triangle to find the area of $ABC$.\nStep 11:  Finally, we can simplify the area to the required form $m \\sqrt{n}$ and find the sum of $m$ and $n$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$",

Let's denote the discounted price as $x$. The sales tax on this price would be $0.075x$.\nStep 3:  Since Carlos had to pay the sales tax on the discounted price, we can express the total amount he paid as the discounted price plus the sales tax, which gives us the equation $x + 0.075x = 43$.\nStep 4:  Solving for $x$, we get $1.075x = 43$, and then $x = \\frac{43}{1.075} = 40$.\nStep 5:  This means that the discounted price of the shoes is $40. Now, we need to find the original price before the $20\\%$ discount.\nStep 6:  Let's denote the original price as $y$.

For instance, $\\text{lcm}(a,b)=2^3\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 5^3$ tells us that the highest power of $2$ in the prime factorization of $a$ and $b$ is $2^3$, the highest power of $3$ is $3^2$, and the highest power of $5$ is $5^3$.\nStep 3:  We can use this information to determine the prime factorization of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ by comparing the powers of the prime factors in the lcm relations.\nStep 4:  From the given relations, we can deduce that $a$ must have a factor of $2^3$ and $3^2$ in its prime factorization, while $b$ must have a factor of $2^3$ and $3^2$ as well. Similarly, $c$ and $d$ must have a factor of $2^3$ and $3^2$ in their prime factorizations.\nStep 5:  Additionally, we can see that $a$ must have a factor of $5^3$ in its prime factorization, while $b$ and $c$ must have a factor of $5^2$ in their prime factorizations. This implies that $d$ must have a factor of $5^3$ in its prime factorization.\nStep 6:  By analyzing the given relations, we can conclude that the prime factorization of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ must be of the form $2^3\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 5^3$, $2^3\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 5^2$, $2^3\\cdot 3^3\\cdot 5^2$, and $2^3\\cdot 3^3\\cdot 5^3$ respectively.\nStep 7:  Now, we can find the gcd of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ by taking the lowest power of each prime factor that appears in their prime factorizations.\nStep 8:  The lowest power of $2$ in the prime factorizations of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ is $2^3$. The lowest power of $3$ is $3^2$, and the lowest power of $5$ is $5^2$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the gcd of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ is $2^3\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 5^2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3600}$",
