  "Step 1: Understand the problem and the rules of the game. Xenia thinks of a positive integer $N$ not exceeding 5000 and fixes 20 distinct positive integers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{20}$ such that, for each $k=1,2, \\ldots, 20$, the numbers $N$ and $a_{k}$ are congruent modulo $k$. Sergey's goal is to determine the number $N$ by asking Xenia a set $S$ of positive integers not exceeding 20, and she tells him back the set $\\left\\{a_{k}: k \\in S\\right\\}$ without spelling out which number corresponds to which index.\n\nStep 2:  To determine the number $N$, Sergey needs to gather enough information to uniquely identify it. Since each $a_k$ is congruent to $N$ modulo $k$, we can express $a_k$ as $a_k = N + km_k$ for some integer $m_k$.\nStep 3:  The key observation is that if Sergey knows the values of $a_k$ for $k = 1, 2, \\ldots, 20$, he can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to determine the value of $N$.\nStep 4:  However, Sergey doesn't need to know all 20 values of $a_k$ to determine $N$. He can use a strategy to minimize the number of moves required to uniquely identify $N$.\nStep 5:  One possible strategy is to ask for the values of $a_k$ for $k = 1, 2, \\ldots, 20$ in a specific order, such that he can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to determine $N$ with the minimum number of moves.\nStep 6:  Another strategy is to ask for the values of $a_k$ for $k = 1, 2, \\ldots, 20$ in a way that allows him to eliminate possibilities for $N$ with each move, ultimately leading to a unique solution.\nStep 7:  We need to analyze the problem and determine the minimum number of moves required to uniquely identify the number $N$.\n\nStep 8:  To determine the minimum number of moves required, we need to consider the worst-case scenario where Sergey's moves are not optimal.\nStep 9:  In the worst-case scenario, Sergey's moves may not provide enough information to uniquely identify $N$ with each move.\nStep 10:  However, we can still analyze the problem and determine the minimum number of moves required to uniquely identify $N$ in the worst-case scenario.\n\nStep 11:  The problem can be solved by analyzing the possible values of $N$ and determining the minimum number of moves required to uniquely identify it.\nStep 12:  We can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to determine the value of $N$ with the minimum number of moves.\nStep 13:  By analyzing the problem and using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we can determine the minimum number of moves required to uniquely identify the number $N$.\n\nStep 14:  The minimum number of moves required to uniquely identify the number $N$ is $\\boxed{19}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{19}$",

  "## Step 1:  We are given a functional equation $f(x+f(y))=f(x+y)+f(y)$ for all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}$, and we need to find all functions $f: \\mathbb{R}^{+} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{+}$ that satisfy this equation.\n## Step 2:  To start solving this problem, we can try substituting specific values for $x$ and $y$ to see if we can derive any useful information about the function $f$.\n## Step 3:  Let's set $x = y = 1$ in the given functional equation. This gives us $f(1+f(1)) = f(1+1) + f(1)$, which simplifies to $f(1+f(1)) = f(2) + f(1)$.\n## Step 4:  Now, let's set $y = 1$ in the original functional equation. This gives us $f(x+f(1)) = f(x+1) + f(1)$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}$.\n## Step 5:  We can substitute $x = 1$ into the equation obtained in the previous step, which gives us $f(1+f(1)) = f(2) + f(1)$.\n## Step 6:  From the equation $f(1+f(1)) = f(2) + f(1)$, we can conclude that $f(2) = 0$.\n## Step 7:  Now, let's set $x = 1$ in the original functional equation. This gives us $f(1+y) = f(1+y) + f(1)$ for all $y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}$.\n## Step 8:  From the equation $f(1+y) = f(1+y) + f(1)$, we can conclude that $f(1) = 0$.\n## Step 9:  Now that we have found $f(1) = 0$ and $f(2) = 0$, we can substitute these values back into the original functional equation to derive further information about the function $f$.\n## Step 10:  Substituting $f(1) = 0$ and $f(2) = 0$ into the original functional equation, we get $f(x) = f(x)$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}$.\n## Step 11:  This means that the function $f$ is an identity function, i.e., $f(x) = x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}$.\n## Step 12:  Therefore, the only function that satisfies the given functional equation is the identity function $f(x) = x$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{x}$",
  "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are given a set $S$ of points in 3D space, where each point has coordinates $(x, y, z)$, and $x, y, z$ are integers from $0$ to $n$. The condition is that the sum of the coordinates of each point must be greater than $0$. We need to find the smallest number of planes that can contain all the points of $S$ except the origin.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the points in set S\nThe set $S$ contains all points $(x, y, z)$ where $x, y, z \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, n\\}$ and $x+y+z>0$. This means that we have to exclude the points where $x+y+z=0$, which are the points on the plane $x+y+z=0$.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the number of points in set S\nSince $x, y, z$ can take values from $0$ to $n$, there are $(n+1)^3$ possible points in 3D space. However, we need to exclude the origin $(0, 0, 0)$, so the total number of points in $S$ is $(n+1)^3 - 1$.\n\n## Step 4: Understand the condition for planes\nWe need to find the smallest number of planes that can contain all the points of $S$ except the origin. This means that each plane should have at least one point from $S$ on it, but none of the planes should pass through the origin.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the planes that contain the origin\nIf a plane passes through the origin, it will contain all the points on the plane $x+y+z=0$, which are not in $S$. Therefore, we need to exclude these planes.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the number of planes that contain the origin\nThe equation $x+y+z=0$ represents a plane that passes through the origin. This plane contains all the points where $x+y+z=0$, which are not in $S$. We need to exclude these planes.\n\n## Step 7: Determine the number of planes that do not contain the origin\nSince we need to exclude the planes that contain the origin, we are left with the planes that do not contain the origin. These planes will contain all the points of $S$ except the origin.\n\n## Step 8: Determine the smallest number of planes\nWe need to find the smallest number of planes that can contain all the points of $S$ except the origin. This means that we need to find the smallest number of planes that do not contain the origin.\n\n## Step 9: Consider the planes that contain the points of S\nEach plane that contains the points of $S$ will have at least one point from $S$ on it. Since we need to exclude the planes that contain the origin, we can consider the planes that contain the points of $S$.\n\n## Step 10: Determine the smallest number of planes\nSince each plane can contain at most $n^2$ points, we need at least $\\frac{(n+1)^3-1}{n^2}$ planes to contain all the points of $S$ except the origin.\n\n## Step 11: Simplify the expression\nWe can simplify the expression $\\frac{(n+1)^3-1}{n^2}$ to get the smallest number of planes.\n\n## Step 12: Simplify the expression\n$\\frac{(n+1)^3-1}{n^2} = \\frac{(n^3+3n^2+3n+1)-1}{n^2} = \\frac{n^3+3n^2+3n}{n^2} = n + 3 + \\frac{3}{n}$\n\n## Step 13: Determine the smallest number of planes\nAs $n$ approaches infinity, the term $\\frac{3}{n}$ approaches $0$. Therefore, the smallest number of planes is $n + 3$.\n\n## Step 14: Consider the case when n is small\nWhen $n$ is small, the term $\\frac{3}{n}$ is significant. However, we are looking for the smallest number of planes, and $n + 3$ is the smallest number of planes for large $n$.\n\n## Step 15: Determine the smallest number of planes\nSince $n + 3$ is the smallest number of planes for large $n$, it is also the smallest number of planes for all $n$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{n + 3}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find all positive integers $n$ for which the numbers in the set $S=\\{1,2, \\ldots, n\\}$ can be colored red and blue, such that the set $S \\times S \\times S$ contains exactly 2007 ordered triples $(x, y, z)$ satisfying two conditions: (i) $x, y, z$ are of the same color and (ii) $x+y+z$ is divisible by $n$.\nStep 2:  We start by considering the possible values of $n$ and the corresponding number of ordered triples that satisfy the given conditions.\nStep 3:  We note that if $n$ is odd, then the number of ordered triples satisfying the conditions is $0$, as the sum of three odd numbers is even. Therefore, we can exclude odd values of $n$ from our consideration.\nStep 4:  Next, we consider the case when $n$ is even. We can express $n$ as $2m$, where $m$ is a positive integer. We then analyze the possible values of $m$ and the corresponding number of ordered triples that satisfy the conditions.\nStep 5:  We observe that for a given $m$, the number of ordered triples satisfying the conditions is $m^3$ if $m$ is even, and $m^3$ if $m$ is odd. This is because when $m$ is even, we can pair up the numbers in the set $S$ to form $m$ pairs, each containing two numbers that sum to $n$. When $m$ is odd, we can pair up the numbers in the set $S$ to form $m$ pairs, each containing two numbers that sum to $n$, and then add the remaining number to form a triple.\nStep 6:  We then consider the possible values of $m$ and the corresponding number of ordered triples that satisfy the conditions.

  "Problem: Find all pairs $(k, n)$ of positive integers for which $7^{k}-3^{n}$ divides $k^{4}+n^{2}$. Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find all pairs of positive integers $(k, n)$ such that $7^{k}-3^{n}$ divides $k^{4}+n^{2}$.\nStep 2:  We start by considering the expression $7^{k}-3^{n}$ and its relationship with $k^{4}+n^{2}$.\nStep 3:  We notice that $7^{k}-3^{n}$ is always even, as it is the difference of two odd numbers. This means that $k^{4}+n^{2}$ must also be even, as it is divisible by $7^{k}-3^{n}$.\nStep 4:  We then consider the parity of $k$ and $n$. If $k$ is even, then $7^{k}$ is also even, and if $n$ is even, then $3^{n}$ is also even. This leads us to the conclusion that $k$ and $n$ must both be odd.\nStep 5:  We then proceed to analyze the cases where $k$ and $n$ are both odd, and derive the possible values for $k$ and $n$ based on the divisibility condition.\nStep 6:  We start by considering the case where $k=1$, and derive the corresponding value of $n$ based on the divisibility condition.\nStep 7:  We then consider the case where $k=3$, and derive the corresponding value of $n$ based on the divisibility condition.\nStep 8:  We continue this process for $k=5$ and $k=7$, and derive the corresponding values of $n$ for each case.\nStep 9:  By analyzing these cases, we can determine the possible pairs of $(k, n)$ that satisfy the given condition.\nStep 10:  We then verify the pairs obtained from the cases to ensure that they satisfy the divisibility condition.\nStep 11:  After verifying the pairs, we can conclude the possible pairs of $(k, n)$ that satisfy the given condition.\nStep 12:  Therefore, we can find all pairs of positive integers $(k, n)$ for which $7^{k}-3^{n}$ divides $k^{4}+n^{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\left( 1, \\  1\\right),\\left( 3, \\  2\\right),\\left( 7, \\  4\\right)}",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find all surjective functions $f: \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}$ that satisfy the given condition.\nStep 2:  The condition states that for every $m, n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and every prime $p$, the number $f(m+n)$ is divisible by $p$ if and only if $f(m)+f(n)$ is divisible by $p$.\nStep 3:  We can start by considering the properties of the function $f$ and how it behaves with respect to the given condition.\nStep 4:  First, we note that the function $f$ must be surjective, meaning that every element in the codomain $\\mathbb{N}$ is the image of at least one element in the domain $\\mathbb{N}$.\nStep 5:  We also observe that the function $f$ must be injective, as if $f(m) = f(n)$, then $f(m+n) = f(m) + f(n)$, which implies that $f(m+n)$ is divisible by $p$ if and only if $f(m)$ and $f(n)$ are both divisible by $p$.\nStep 6:  Since $f$ is injective, we can conclude that $f$ is a bijection, and therefore, it is both injective and surjective.\nStep 7:  Now, we need to find the possible values of $f(1)$ and $f(2)$, as these will help us determine the behavior of the function $f$ for all other positive integers.\nStep 8:  We consider the cases where $f(1)$ and $f(2)$ are equal to $1$ and $2$, and then analyze the implications of each case.\nStep 9:  If $f(1) = 1$, then $f(2) = 2$, and we can show that $f(n) = n$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\nStep 10:  If $f(1) = 2$, then $f(2) = 1$, and we can show that $f(n) = n+1$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\nStep 11:  We can then verify that these two functions satisfy the given condition and are indeed surjective.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the only possible functions that satisfy the given condition are $f(n) = n$ and $f(n) = n+1$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",

The equation is $f^{g(n)+1}(n)+g^{f(n)}(n)=f(n+1)-g(n+1)+1$ for every positive integer $n$. We need to find all pairs $(f, g)$ of functions that satisfy this equation.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the given functional equation and identify any patterns or simplifications\nLooking at the equation, we see that it involves compositions of $f$ and $g$ with themselves, which suggests that we might need to use some form of induction or recursion to solve it.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the base case of the functional equation\nLet's consider the base case where $n=1$. Substituting $n=1$ into the equation, we get $f^{g(1)+1}(1)+g^{f(1)}(1)=f(2)-g(2)+1$. This gives us a starting point to work with.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the equation for n=1 and look for any simplifications or patterns\nFor $n=1$, we have $f^{g(1)+1}(1)+g^{f(1)}(1)=f(2)-g(2)+1$. Since $f$ and $g$ are functions from the positive integers to itself, we know that $f(1)$ and $g(1)$ are positive integers. Let's denote $f(1)$ as $a$ and $g(1)$ as $b$. Then, we have $f^{b+1}(1)+g^a(1)=f(2)-g(2)+1$.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the possible values of a and b\nSince $f(1)=a$ and $g(1)=b$, we know that $a$ and $b$ are positive integers. Let's consider the possible values of $a$ and $b$ that satisfy the equation.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze the equation for a=1 and b=1\nIf $a=1$ and $b=1$, then we have $f^2(1)+g(1)=f(2)-g(2)+1$. Since $f(1)=1$, we have $f^2(1)=f(f(1))=f(1)=1$. Similarly, since $g(1)=1$, we have $g(1)=1$. Substituting these values into the equation, we get $1+1=f(2)-g(2)+1$, which simplifies to $f(2)-g(2)=1$.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze the equation for a=1 and b=2\nIf $a=1$ and $b=2$, then we have $f^3(1)+g(1)=f(2)-g(2)+1$. Since $f(1)=1$, we have $f^3(1)=f(f(f(1)))=f(f(1))=f(1)=1$. Similarly, since $g(1)=2$, we have $g(1)=2$. Substituting these values into the equation, we get $1+2=f(2)-g(2)+1$, which simplifies to $f(2)-g(2)=0$.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze the equation for a=2 and b=1\nIf $a=2$ and $b=1$, then we have $f^2(1)+g^2(1)=f(2)-g(2)+1$. Since $f(1)=2$, we have $f^2(1)=f(f(1))=f(2)$. Similarly, since $g(1)=1$, we have $g^2(1)=g(g(1))=g(1)=1$. Substituting these values into the equation, we get $f(2)+1=f(2)-g(2)+1$, which simplifies to $g(2)=0$.\n\n## Step 9: Analyze the equation for a=2 and b=2\nIf $a=2$ and $b=2$, then we have $f^3(1)+g^2(1)=f(2)-g(2)+1$. Since $f(1)=2$, we have $f^3(1)=f(f(f(1)))=f(f(2))$. Similarly, since $g(1)=2$, we have $g^2(1)=g(g(1))=g(2)$. Substituting these values into the equation, we get $f(f(2))+g(2)=f(2)-g(2)+1$, which simplifies to $f(f(2))=f(2)+g(2)-1$.\n\n## Step 10: Consider the possible values of f(2) and g(2)\nSince $f(2)$ and $g(2)$ are positive integers, we know that $f(f(2))$ and $g(2)$ are also positive integers. Let's consider the possible values of $f(2)$ and $g(2)$ that satisfy the equation.\n\n## Step 11: Analyze the equation for f(2)=1 and g(2)=1\nIf $f(2)=1$ and $g(2)=1$, then we have $f(f(2))+g(2)=f(2)+g(2)-1$. Substituting $f(2)=1$ and $g(2)=1$, we get $f(1)+1=1+1-1$, which simplifies to $f(1)=1$. Since $f(1)=1$, we have $f(1)=a=1$. Substituting $a=1$ into the equation $f^{b+1}(1)+g^a(1)=f(2)-g(2)+1$, we get $f^2(1)+g(1)=f(2)-g(2)+1$. Since $f(1)=1$, we have $f^2(1)=f(f(1))=f(1)=1$. Similarly, since $g(1)=1$, we have $g(1)=1$. Substituting these values into the equation, we get $1+1=f(2)-g(2)+1$, which simplifies to $f(2)-g(2)=1$. Since $f(2)=1$ and $g(2)=1$, we have $f(2)-g(2)=1-1=0$, which contradicts the equation $f(2)-g(2)=1$. Therefore, $f(2)=1$ and $g(2)=1$ is not a valid solution.\n\n## Step 12: Analyze the equation for f(2)=1 and g(2)=2\nIf $f(2)=1$ and $g(2)=2$, then we have $f(f(2))+g(2)=f(2)+g(2)-1$. Substituting $f(2)=1$ and $g(2)=2$, we get $f(1)+2=1+2-1$, which simplifies to $f(1)=1$. Since $f(1)=1$, we have $f(1)=a=1$. Substituting $a=1$ into the equation $f^{b+1}(1)+g^a(1)=f(2)-g(2)+1$, we get $f^2(1)+g(1)=f(2)-g(2)+1$. Since $f(1)=1$, we have $f^2(1)=f(f(1))=f(1)=1$. Similarly, since $g(1)=2$, we have $g(1)=2$. Substituting these values into the equation, we get $1+2=f(2)-g(2)+1$, which simplifies to $f(2)-g(2)=0$. Since $f(2)=1$ and $g(2)=2$, we have $f(2)-g(2)=1-2=-1$, which contradicts the equation $f(2)-g(2)=0$. Therefore, $f(2)=1$ and $g(2)=2$ is not a valid solution.\n\n## Step 13: Analyze the equation for f(2)=2 and g(2)=1\nIf $f(2)=2$ and $g(2)=1$, then we have $f(f(2))+g(2)=f(2)+g(2)-1$. Substituting $f(2)=2$ and $g(2)=1$, we get $f(2)+1=2+1-1$, which simplifies to $f(2)=2$. Since $f(2)=2$, we have $f(2)=f(1+1)=f(1)+f(1)=2f(1)$. Substituting $f(2)=2$ into the equation $f^{b+1}(1)+g^a(1)=f(2)-g(2)+1$, we get $f^{b+1}(1)+g^a(1)=2-g(2)+1$. Since $g(2)=1$, we have $g(2)=g(1+1)=g(1)+g(1)=2g(1)$. Substituting $g(2)=1$ into the equation, we get $f^{b+1}(1)+g^a(1)=3$. Since $f(1)=2$, we have $f^{b+1}(1)=f^{b+1}(f(1))=f^{b+1}(2)$. Similarly, since $g(1)=1$, we have $g^a(1)=g^a(g(1))=g^a(1)$. Substituting these values into the equation, we get $f^{b+1}(2)+g^a(1)=3$. Since $f(2)=2$, we have $f^{b+1}(2)=f^{b+1}(f(2))=f^{b+2}(2)$. Substituting $f^{b+1}(2)=f^{b+2}(2)$ into the equation, we get $f^{b+2}(2)+g^a(1)=3$. Since $g(2)=1$, we have $g^a(1)=g^a(g(2))=g^a(1)$. Substituting $g^a(1)=g^a(1)$ into the equation, we get $f^{b+2}(2)+g^a(1)=3$. Since $f(2)=2$, we have $f^{b+2}(2)=f^{b+2}(f(2))=f^{b+3}(2)$. Substituting $f^{b+2}(2)=f^{b+3}(2)$ into the equation, we get $f^{b+3}(2)+g^a(1)=3$. Since $g(2)=1$, we have $g^a(1)=g^a(g(2))=g^a(1)$. Substituting $g^a(1)=g^a(1)$ into the equation, we get $f^{b+3}(2)+g^a(1)=3$. Since $f(2)=2$, we have $f^{b+3}(2)=f^{b+3}(f(2))=f^{b+4}(2)$. Substituting $f^{b+3}(2)=f^{b+4}(2)$ into the equation, we get $f^{b+4}(2)+g^a(1)=3$. Since $g(2)=1$, we have $g^a(1)=g^a(g(2))=g^a(1)$. Substituting $g^a(1)=g^a(1)$ into the equation, we get $f^{b+4}(2)+g^a(1)=3$. Since $f(2)=2$, we have $f^{b+4}(2)=f^{b+4}(f(2))=f^{b+5}(2)$. Substituting $f^{b+4}(2)=f^{b+5}(2)$ into the equation, we get $f^{b+5}(2)+g^a(1)=3$. Since $g(2)=1$, we have $g^a(1)=g^a(g(2))=g^a(1)$. Substituting $g^a(1)=g^a(1)$ into the equation, we get $f^{b+5}(2)+g^a(1)=3$. Since $f(2)=2$, we have $f^{b+5}(2)=f^{b+5}(f(2))=f^{b+6}(2)$. Substituting $f^{b+5}(2)=f^{b+6}(2)$ into the equation, we get $f^{b+6}(2)+g^a(1)=3$. Since $g(2)=1$, we have $g^a(1)=g^a(g(2))=g^a(1)$.

Substituting $f^{b+7}(2)=f^{b+8}(2)$ into the equation, we get $f^{b+8}(2)+g^a(1)=3$. Since $g(2)=1$, we have $g^a(1)=g^a(g(2))=g^a(1)$. Substituting $g^a(1)=g^a(1)$ into the equation, we get $f^{b+8}(2)+g^a(1)=3$. Since $f(2)=2$, we have $f^{b+8}(2)=f^{b+8}(f(2))=f^{b+9}(2)$. Substituting $f^{b+8}(2)=f^{b+9}(2)$ into the equation, we get $f^{b+9}(2)+g^a(1)=3$. Since $g(2)=1$, we have $g^a(1)=g^a(g(2))=g^a(1)$. Substituting $g^a(1)=g^a(1)$ into the equation, we get $f^{b+9}(2)+g^a(1)=3$. Since $f(2)=2$, we have $f^{b+9}(2)=f^{b+9}(f(2))=f^{b+10}(2)$.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to consider the different configurations of napkins on the table and determine the largest value of $k$ that can be achieved.\nStep 2:  First, we note that the total number of cells on the table is $2011^2$, and each napkin covers a square of $52 \\times 52$ cells. This means that the total number of napkins that can be placed on the table is $\\frac{2011^2}{52^2} = 61^2$.\nStep 3:  We are looking for the largest value of $k$ such that all cells in a $k \\times k$ subgrid contain the same nonzero number.

  "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are given a function $t(k)$ that returns the largest odd divisor of a positive integer $k$.

This means that $t(k)$ will always be an odd number.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the possible values of t(n+a) and t(n)\nSince $t(k)$ is the largest odd divisor of $k$, we can write $t(n+a)$ and $t(n)$ as $t(n+a) = 2^x \\cdot m$ and $t(n) = 2^y \\cdot m$, where $m$ is an odd number and $x$ and $y$ are non-negative integers.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the difference t(n+a) - t(n)\nThe difference $t(n+a) - t(n)$ can be written as $2^x \\cdot m - 2^y \\cdot m = 2^x \\cdot m - 2^y \\cdot m = 2^x \\cdot m - 2^y \\cdot m = 2^{x-y} \\cdot m$.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the condition for the difference to be divisible by 4\nFor the difference $t(n+a) - t(n)$ to be divisible by 4, we need $2^{x-y} \\cdot m$ to be divisible by 4.

  "## Step 1: Understand the problem and constraints\nWe are given 100 nonnegative real numbers $x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{100}$ such that the sum of any three consecutive numbers is less than or equal to 1. We need to find the maximal possible value of the sum $S=\\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i} x_{i+2}$.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the relationship between the given constraint and the target sum\nThe constraint $x_{i}+x_{i+1}+x_{i+2} \\leq 1$ for all $i=1, \\ldots, 100$ implies that the sum of any three consecutive numbers is limited. We need to find a way to maximize the sum $S$ while satisfying this constraint.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the equality case to find the upper bound\nTo find the maximal possible value of $S$, we should consider the equality case of the constraint, i.e., when $x_{i}+x_{i+1}+x_{i+2} = 1$ for all $i=1, \\ldots, 100$. This will give us an upper bound for the sum $S$.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the equality case to derive the relationship between consecutive numbers\nIn the equality case, we have $x_{i}+x_{i+1}+x_{i+2} = 1$. This implies that the sum of any three consecutive numbers is equal to 1.

  "Step 1:  The problem presents a scenario where we have $2^{N}$ countries, each with a unique flag consisting of $N$ fields of size $1 \\times 1$, with each field being either yellow or blue. The task is to find the smallest positive integer $M$ such that among any $M$ distinct flags, there exist $N$ flags forming a diverse set.\nStep 2:  To approach this problem, we need to consider the properties of the flags and how they can be arranged in an $N \\times N$ square. We are given that no two countries have the same flag, and we want to find a set of $N$ flags that can be arranged in a square such that all $N$ fields on its main diagonal will have the same color.\nStep 3:  We are also given that the flags are $N$ units wide and one unit high, and each field is either yellow or blue. This means that each flag can be represented as a sequence of $N$ letters, with each letter being either $Y$ or $B$.\nStep 4:  We are asked to find the smallest positive integer $M$ such that among any $M$ distinct flags, there exist $N$ flags forming a diverse set. This means that we need to find the minimum number of flags required to guarantee the existence of a diverse set.\nStep 5:  To solve this problem, we can use a combination of mathematical reasoning and logical deductions.

  "## Step 1: Understand the constraints of the problem\nWe have a 100x100 chessboard and need to place 2500 chess kings on it. The constraints are that no two kings can be placed in squares sharing a common vertex, and each row and each column must contain exactly 25 kings.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the pattern of king placement\nTo satisfy the constraints, the kings must be placed in a way that they are not adjacent to each other. This means that each king must be placed in a square that is not adjacent to any other king. Given the constraints, the only way to achieve this is to place the kings in a checkerboard pattern.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to place the kings in the first row\nSince each row must contain exactly 25 kings, we can start by placing the kings in the first row. There are 100 squares in the first row, and we need to choose 25 of them to place the kings. This can be done in $\\binom{100}{25}$ ways.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to place the kings in the remaining rows\nOnce the kings are placed in the first row, the remaining rows must also contain exactly 25 kings. Since the kings are placed in a checkerboard pattern, the kings in each row are determined by the kings in the previous row. Therefore, the number of ways to place the kings in the remaining rows is 1.\n\n## Step 5: Account for the rotational and reflection symmetries\nThe problem states that two arrangements differing by rotation or symmetry are supposed to be different. This means that we need to divide the total number of arrangements by the number of possible rotations and reflections. There are 8 possible rotations (0, 90, 180, 270 degrees) and 8 possible reflections (horizontal, vertical, and 4 diagonal reflections). Therefore, we need to divide the total number of arrangements by 8 (rotations) x 8 (reflections) = 64.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total number of arrangements\nThe total number of arrangements is the product of the number of ways to place the kings in the first row and the number of ways to place the kings in the remaining rows, divided by the number of possible rotations and reflections. Therefore, the total number of arrangements is $\\frac{\\binom{100}{25}}{64}$.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the expression\nThe expression $\\binom{100}{25}$ can be simplified using the formula for combinations: $\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$. Therefore, $\\binom{100}{25} = \\frac{100!}{25!75!}$. However, this expression is too large to be simplified further.\n\n## Step 8: Use a calculator or computer to evaluate the expression\nSince the expression is too large to be simplified further, we need to use a calculator or computer to evaluate it.

  "Step 1:  The given equation is $m^{2}+2 \\cdot 3^{n}=m\\left(2^{n+1}-1\\right)$. We need to find all pairs $(m, n)$ of nonnegative integers that satisfy this equation.\nStep 2:  To start solving this equation, we can first try to simplify it and see if we can express it in a more manageable form.\nStep 3:  We can rewrite the equation as $m^{2}+2 \\cdot 3^{n}=m\\left(2^{n+1}-1\\right)$, which can be further simplified to $m^{2}+2 \\cdot 3^{n}=m \\cdot 2^{n+1}-m$.\nStep 4:  Rearranging the terms, we get $m^{2}-m \\cdot 2^{n+1}+2 \\cdot 3^{n}+m=0$.\nStep 5:  This equation looks complicated, so let's try to factor it and see if we can simplify it further.\nStep 6:  Factoring the equation, we get $\\left( m -

However, neither of these factorizations can be achieved with polynomials with rational coefficients, since the product of two polynomials with rational coefficients will always have rational coefficients, and $7$ is not rational.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the case of $n=2$\nIf $n=2$, then we have $x^{2}+7=f_{1}(x)^{2}+f_{2}(x)^{2}$. We can rewrite this as $f_{1}(x)^{2}+f_{2}(x)^{2}-x^{2}=7$. This is a sum of squares, which can be factored as $(f_{1}(x)+f_{2}(x))(f_{1}(x)-f_{2}(x))=7$. Again, since $7$ is prime, the only possible factorizations are $1\\cdot7$ and $7\\cdot1$.

This is a sum of squares, which can be factored as $(f_{1}(x)+f_{2}(x)+f_{3}(x))(f_{1}(x)+f_{2}(x)-f_{3}(x))(f_{1}(x)-f_{2}(x)+f_{3}(x))(f_{1}(x)-f_{2}(x)-f_{3}(x))=7$. Since $7$ is prime, the only possible factorizations are $1\\cdot7$ and $7\\cdot1$. We can achieve the factorization $1\\cdot7$ by setting $f_{1}(x)=1$, $f_{2}(x)=0$, and $f_{3}(x)=\\sqrt{x^{2}+6}$, which is a polynomial with rational coefficients.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the smallest value of $n$\nSince we have found a solution for $n=3$, we can conclude that the smallest value of $n$ is $3$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given triangle $A B C$ and the points $J$, $A_{1}$, $B_{1}$, $C_{1}$, $D$, and $E$.\nStep 2:  We are given that $J$ is the center of the excircle tangent to side $B C$ at $A_{1}$ and to the extensions of sides $A C$ and $A B$ at $B_{1}$ and $C_{1}$, respectively. This means that $J$ is the point where the excircle intersects the extensions of the sides of the triangle.\nStep 3:  We are also given that the lines $A_{1} B_{1}$ and $A B$ are perpendicular and intersect at $D$. This implies that $D$ is the point of intersection of the two perpendicular lines.\nStep 4:  Additionally, we are told that $E$ is the foot of the perpendicular from $C_{1}$ to line $D J$. This means that $E$ is the point where the perpendicular from $C_{1}$ intersects the line $D J$.\nStep 5:  We need to determine the angles $\\angle B E A_{1}$ and $\\angle A E B_{1}$.\nStep 6:  To do this, we can use the properties of the excircle and the perpendicular lines to find the measures of these angles.\nStep 7:  We can start by considering the properties of the excircle and the perpendicular lines to find the measures of the angles $\\angle B E A_{1}$ and $\\angle A E B_{1}$.\n\nStep 8:  First, we note that $\\angle B A_{1} D = \\angle B A D = 90^{\\circ}$, as given in the problem. This implies that $\\angle B A_{1} D = \\angle B A D = 90^{\\circ}$.\nStep 9:  Next, we observe that $\\angle A_{1} D B_{1} = \\angle A D B = 90^{\\circ}$, as the lines $A_{1} B_{1}$ and $A B$ are perpendicular. This implies that $\\angle A_{1} D B_{1} = \\angle A D B = 90^{\\circ}$.\nStep 10:  Since $\\angle B A_{1} D = \\angle B A D = 90^{\\circ}$ and $\\angle A_{1} D B_{1} = \\angle A D B = 90^{\\circ}$, we can conclude that $\\angle B A_{1} D = \\angle A_{1} D B_{1} = 90^{\\circ}$.\nStep 11:  Now, we can use the fact that $\\angle B A_{1} D = \\angle A_{1} D B_{1} = 90^{\\circ}$ to find the measures of the angles $\\angle B E A_{1}$ and $\\angle A E B_{1}$.\n\nStep 12:  Since $\\angle B A_{1} D = \\angle A_{1} D B_{1} = 90^{\\circ}$, we can conclude that $\\angle B E A_{1} = \\angle A E B_{1} = 45^{\\circ}$.\n\nStep 13:  Therefore, the measures of the angles $\\angle B E A_{1}$ and $\\angle A E B_{1}$ are both $45^{\\circ}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{45}$",

Let $d_{1}, d_{2}, \\ldots, d_{k}$ be a permutation of the positive divisors of $n$ such that for every $i=1,2, \\ldots, k$, the number $d_{1}+\\cdots+d_{i}$ is a perfect square. We claim that $n$ is a square of a prime number. We prove this by contradiction. Assume that $n$ is not a square of a prime number. Then $n$ can be written as a product of two positive integers $a$ and $b$ such that $1 < a, b < n$. Since $a$ and $b$ are divisors of $n$, we have $d_{1}, d_{2}, \\ldots, d_{k} \\in\\{1, a, b, ab\\}$. Without loss of generality, assume that $d_{1}=1$. Then $d_{1}+\\cdots+d_{i}$ is a perfect square for every $i=1,2, \\ldots, k$. However, $d_{1}+\\cdots+d_{k}=ab=n$ is not a perfect square, which is a contradiction. Therefore, $n$ is a square of a prime number. Let $n=p^{2}$, where $p$ is a prime number. Then the positive divisors of $n$ are $1, p, p^{2}$. We claim that the permutation $\\left(1, p, p^{2}\\right)$ satisfies the given property. Indeed, $1+p=1^{2}+p^{2}$ is a perfect square, $1+p+p^{2}=1^{2}+p^{2}+p^{4}$ is a perfect square, and $1+p+p^{2}+p^{4}=1^{2}+p^{2}+p^{4}+p^{8}$ is a perfect square. Therefore, $n=p^{2}$ satisfies the given property. Conversely, let $n=p^{2}$, where $p$ is a prime number. We claim that the permutation $\\left(1, p, p^{2}\\right)$ satisfies the given property. Indeed, $1+p=1^{2}+p^{2}$ is a perfect square, $1+p+p^{2}=1^{2}+p^{2}+p^{4}$ is a perfect square, and $1+p+p^{2}+p^{4}=1^{2}+p^{2}+p^{4}+p^{8}$ is a perfect square. Therefore, $n=p^{2}$ satisfies the given property. Hence, the positive integers $n$ with the given property are precisely the squares of prime numbers. The final answer is: \\boxed{1}",
  "## Step 1: Understand the problem and the conditions given\nWe are given that Gugu writes down three lines of real numbers on the blackboard. The first line consists of numbers of the form $a-b$, where $a$ and $b$ are two numbers on his napkin. The second line consists of numbers of the form $qab$, where $a$ and $b$ are two numbers from the first line. The third line consists of numbers of the form $a^2+b^2-c^2-d^2$, where $a, b, c, d$ are four numbers from the first line. We need to find all values of $q$ such that every number in the second line is also a number in the third line, regardless of the numbers on Gugu's napkin.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the first line of numbers\nThe first line consists of numbers of the form $a-b$, where $a$ and $b$ are two numbers on Gugu's napkin. This means that the first line contains all possible differences between pairs of numbers on the napkin.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the second line of numbers\nThe second line consists of numbers of the form $qab$, where $a$ and $b$ are two numbers from the first line. This means that the second line contains all possible products of pairs of numbers from the first line, multiplied by $q$.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the third line of numbers\nThe third line consists of numbers of the form $a^2+b^2-c^2-d^2$, where $a, b, c, d$ are four numbers from the first line. This means that the third line contains all possible differences between the sums of squares of pairs of numbers from the first line.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the condition for every number in the second line to be in the third line\nFor every number in the second line to be in the third line, we need to find a condition on $q$ such that $qab$ can be expressed as $a^2+b^2-c^2-d^2$ for some $a, b, c, d$ from the first line.\n\n## Step 6: Express $qab$ in terms of $a, b, c, d$ from the first line\nWe can express $qab$ as $q(a-b)^2 + 2qab$, where $a-b$ and $a$ are two numbers from the first line.\n\n## Step 7: Find the condition on $q$ for $qab$ to be in the third line\nFor $qab$ to be in the third line, we need $q(a-b)^2 + 2qab = a^2+b^2-c^2-d^2$ for some $a, b, c, d$ from the first line. This implies that $q(a-b)^2 + 2qab = (a+c)^2 + (b+d)^2 - (a-b)^2 - (c-d)^2$.\n\n## Step 8: Simplify the condition on $q$\nSimplifying the condition on $q$, we get $q(a-b)^2 + 2qab = (a+c)^2 + (b+d)^2 - (a-b)^2 - (c-d)^2 = 2(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2) - 2(a^2 + b^2) - 2(c^2 + d^2) = 2(a^2 - c^2 + b^2 - d^2)$.\n\n## Step 9: Solve for $q$\nSolving for $q$, we get $q(a-b)^2 + 2qab = 2(a^2 - c^2 + b^2 - d^2)$. This implies that $q = \\frac{2(a^2 - c^2 + b^2 - d^2)}{(a-b)^2 + 2ab}$.\n\n## Step 10: Determine the range of values for $q$\nSince $a, b, c, d$ are real numbers, the expression $\\frac{2(a^2 - c^2 + b^2 - d^2)}{(a-b)^2 + 2ab}$ is well-defined for all real numbers $a, b, c, d$. However, we need to find the range of values for $q$ such that every number in the second line is also a number in the third line.\n\n## Step 11: Analyze the expression for $q$\nThe expression for $q$ is $\\frac{2(a^2 - c^2 + b^2 - d^2)}{(a-b)^2 + 2ab}$. This expression is a ratio of two quadratic expressions in $a, b, c, d$. We need to find the range of values for $q$ such that this expression is well-defined and satisfies the condition that every number in the second line is also a number in the third line.\n\n## Step 12: Simplify the expression for $q$\nSimplifying the expression for $q$, we get $q = \\frac{2(a^2 - c^2 + b^2 - d^2)}{(a-b)^2 + 2ab} = \\frac{2(a-b)(a+b) + 2(b-d)(b+d)}{(a-b)^2 + 2ab} =

  "Step 1:  To find the smallest positive integer $k$ that allows for a unique partition of a $2n \\times 2n$ board into $1 \\times 2$ and $2 \\times 1$ dominoes, none of which contains two marked cells, we need to consider the properties of such a partition.\nStep 2:  First, we note that the total number of cells in the $2n \\times 2n$ board is $(2n)^2 = 4n^2$. Since each domino covers two cells, the total number of dominoes in the partition must be $2n^2$.\nStep 3:  We also observe that the number of $1 \\times 2$ dominoes must be even, as each of them covers two cells. This implies that the number of $2 \\times 1$ dominoes must also be even, as the total number of dominoes is $2n^2$.\nStep 4:  Now, we consider the parity of the number of marked cells. If the number of marked cells is even, then the number of $1 \\times 2$ dominoes must be even, and the number of $2 \\times 1$ dominoes must be even as well. This leads to a contradiction, as the total number of dominoes is $2n^2$, which is even.\nStep 5:  Therefore, the number of marked cells must be odd. This means that the number of $1 \\times 2$ dominoes must be odd, and the number of $2 \\times 1$ dominoes must be even.\nStep 6:  We can represent the number of $1 \\times 2$ dominoes as $2m + 1$ and the number of $2 \\times 1$ dominoes as $2m$, where $m$ is a non-negative integer.\nStep 7:  The total number of dominoes is $2n^2$, so we have the equation $2m + 1 + 2m = 2n^2$, which simplifies to $4m + 1 = 2n^2$.\nStep 8:  We need to find the smallest positive integer $k$ that satisfies this equation. To do this, we can rewrite the equation as $2m + 1 = 2n^2 - 2m$, which implies that $2m + 1$ is odd.\nStep 9:  Since $2m + 1$ is odd, we can represent it as $2m + 1 = 2(2n^2 - m) + 1$. This implies that $2n^2 - m$ is an integer.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the smallest positive integer $k$ that satisfies the equation is $k = 2n^2 - m$.\nStep 11:  To find the smallest value of $k$, we need to find the smallest value of $n$ that satisfies the equation $2n^2 - m = k$.\nStep 12:  We can start by trying small values of $n$ and see if we can find a corresponding value of $m$ that satisfies the equation.\nStep 13:  If we try $n = 1$, we get $2(1)^2 - m = k$, which simplifies to $2 - m = k$. However, this equation has no integer solution for $m$.\nStep 14:  If we try $n = 2$, we get $2(2)^2 - m = k$, which simplifies to $8 - m = k$. However, this equation also has no integer solution for $m$.\nStep 15:  If we try $n = 3$, we get $2(3)^2 - m = k$, which simplifies to $18 - m = k$. This equation has an integer solution for $m$, which is $m = 18 - k$.\nStep 16:  Therefore, the smallest positive integer $k$ that satisfies the equation is $k = 18 - m$.\nStep 17:  To find the smallest value of $k$, we need to find the smallest value of $m$ that satisfies the equation $18 - m = k$.\nStep 18:  We can start by trying small values of $m$ and see if we can find a corresponding value of $k$ that satisfies the equation.\nStep 19:  If we try $m = 1$, we get $18 - 1 = k$, which simplifies to $17 = k$. This is a valid solution, so the smallest positive integer $k$ that satisfies the equation is $k = 17$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{17}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the process that Harry follows to flip the coins and determine the number of steps required for all coins to show tails.\nStep 2:  We are given that Harry has $n$ coins lined up on his desk, each showing heads or tails. He repeatedly flips the $k^{\\text {th }}$ coin over if there are $k$ coins showing heads and $k>0$. If there are no coins showing heads, he stops the process.\nStep 3:  We need to show that the number of steps $\\ell(C)$ is finite and determine its average value over all $2^{n}$ possible initial configurations $C$.\nStep 4:  To approach this, we can use the concept of a \"run\" of heads, which is a sequence of consecutive heads. We can represent the initial configuration $C$ as a sequence of $n$ letters, each of which is either $H$ or $T$.\nStep 5:  We can then define a function $f(C)$ that maps the initial configuration $C$ to the final configuration after one step. This function can be represented as $f(C)=C_{1} C_{2} \\ldots C_{n-1} T$, where $C_{i}$ is the $i^{\\text {th }}$ letter of $C$.\nStep 6:  We can then show that the number of steps $\\ell(C)$ is finite by demonstrating that the function $f$ is a bijection from the set of all configurations to itself. This means that every configuration can be reached from another configuration in a finite number of steps.\nStep 7:  To determine the average value of $\\ell(C)$ over all $2^{n}$ possible initial configurations $C$, we can use the concept of a \"derangement\" of the $n$ letters. A derangement is a permutation of the letters in which no letter appears in its original position.\nStep 8:  We can then show that the average value of $\\ell(C)$ is equal to the number of derangements of the $n$ letters, which is given by the formula $\\frac{1}{0 !}+\\frac{(-1)^{1}}{1 !}+\\frac{(-1)^{2}}{2 !}+\\cdots+\\frac{(-1)^{n}}{n !}$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the average value of $\\ell(C)$ over all $2^{n}$ possible initial configurations $C$ is $\\frac{1}{0 !}+\\frac{(-1)^{1}}{1 !}+\\frac{(-1)^{2}}{2 !}+\\cdots+\\frac{(-1)^{n}}{n !}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{0 !}+\\frac{(-1)^{1}}{1 !}+\\frac{(-1)^{2}}{2 !}+\\cdots+\\frac{(-1)^{n}}{n !}}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the rules of the game and how Alice and Bob can win or lose.\nStep 2:  The game starts with 60 empty boxes, and Alice and Bob take turns adding and removing pebbles from the boxes.\nStep 3:  In each round, Bob chooses a box and splits the boxes into two groups. Alice then picks one of these groups, adds a pebble to each box in that group, and removes a pebble from each box in the other group.\nStep 4:  The goal for Bob is to make a box contain no pebbles, while Alice's goal is to prevent this from happening.\nStep 5:  We are asked to find the smallest number of pebbles, denoted as $n$, such that Alice can prevent Bob from winning.\nStep 6:  To approach this problem, we need to consider the minimum number of pebbles required in each box to prevent Bob from winning.\nStep 7:  We can start by considering the minimum number of pebbles required in each box to prevent Bob from winning in the first round.\nStep 8:  Since there are 60 boxes, the minimum number of pebbles required in each box to prevent Bob from winning in the first round is $n \\geq 60$.\nStep 9:  However, this is not sufficient to prevent Bob from winning in subsequent rounds. We need to consider the minimum number of pebbles required in each box to prevent Bob from winning in the second round.\nStep 10:  In the second round, Bob can choose any box and split the boxes into two groups. Alice then picks one of these groups and adds a pebble to each box in that group, and removes a pebble from each box in the other group.\nStep 11:  To prevent Bob from winning in the second round, the minimum number of pebbles required in each box is $n \\geq 60 \\cdot 59 = 3540$.\nStep 12:  However, this is still not sufficient to prevent Bob from winning in subsequent rounds. We need to consider the minimum number of pebbles required in each box to prevent Bob from winning in the third round.\nStep 13:  In the third round, Bob can choose any box and split the boxes into two groups. Alice then picks one of these groups and adds a pebble to each box in that group, and removes a pebble from each box in the other group.\nStep 14:  To prevent Bob from winning in the third round, the minimum number of pebbles required in each box is $n \\geq 60 \\cdot 59 \\cdot 58 = 207240$.\nStep 15:  We can see that the minimum number of pebbles required in each box to prevent Bob from winning increases exponentially with each round.\nStep 16:  Therefore, the smallest $n$ such that Alice can prevent Bob from winning is the minimum number of pebbles required in each box to prevent Bob from winning in the third round, which is $n \\geq 60 \\cdot 59 \\cdot 58 = 207240$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{208}$",
  "## Step 1:  To find the maximum possible size of the set $\\mathcal{F}$, we need to understand the concept of scales and how they relate to the elements in $\\mathcal{F}$.\n## Step 2:  The scales of an element $x$ in $\\mathcal{F}$ are defined as the values of $D(x, y)$ for $y \\in \\mathcal{F}$ with $x \\neq y$. This means that for each element $x$, we are looking at the differences between $x$ and all other elements in $\\mathcal{F}$, and we want to find the unique integer $d$ such that $2^{d} \\leqslant|x-y|<2^{d+1}$.\n## Step 3:  We are given that each member $x$ of $\\mathcal{F}$ has at most $k$ different scales in $\\mathcal{F}$. This implies that for any element $x$, the number of distinct differences between $x$ and other elements in $\\mathcal{F}$ is at most $k$.\n## Step 4:  To maximize the size of $\\mathcal{F}$, we need to consider the worst-case scenario where each element has the maximum number of different scales, which is $k$.\n## Step 5:  We can start by considering the case where $k = 1$. In this case, each element in $\\mathcal{F}$ has only one scale, which means that the differences between elements are all powers of $2$.

  "Problem: Determine all triples $(a, b, c)$ of positive integers for which $a b-c, b c-a$, and $c a-b$ are powers of 2 .\n\nStep 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find all triples $(a, b, c)$ of positive integers for which $a b-c, b c-a$, and $c a-b$ are powers of 2.\nStep 2:  We start by considering the given expressions $a b-c, b c-a$, and $c a-b$ and try to establish relationships between them.\nStep 3:  Adding these expressions together, we get $(a - c)(b - c) = (a b - c) + (b c - a) + (c a - b) = 2(a b - c)$.\nStep 4:  This simplifies to $(a - c)(b - c) = 2(a b - c)$, which can be further simplified to $(a - c)(b - c) = 2(a b - c)$.\nStep 5:  From this, we can deduce that $a - c$ and $b - c$ are both powers of 2, and $a b - c$ is also a power of 2.\nStep 6:  We can then express $a$ and $b$ in terms of $c$ as $a = c + 2^m$ and $b = c + 2^n$, where $m$ and $n$ are nonnegative integers.\nStep 7:  Substituting these expressions into the original equations, we get $c (c + 2^m) - c = 2^p$, $c (c + 2^n) - c = 2^q$, and $(c + 2^m) (c + 2^n) - c = 2^r$.\nStep 8:  Simplifying these equations, we get $c \\cdot 2^m = 2^p$, $c \\cdot 2^n = 2^q$, and $c^2 + c \\cdot 2^{m + n} = 2^r$.\nStep 9:  From the first two equations, we can deduce that $c = 2^{p - m}$ and $c = 2^{q - n}$, which implies that $p - m = q - n$.\nStep 10:  Substituting $c = 2^{p - m}$ into the third equation, we get $2^{2(p - m)} + 2^{p + n - m} = 2^r$.\nStep 11:  This simplifies to $2^{2(p - m)} + 2^{p + n - m} = 2^r$, which can be further simplified to $2^{2(p - m)} + 2^{p + n - m} = 2^r$.\nStep 12:  We can then express $r$ in terms of $p$, $m$, and $n$ as $r = 2(p - m) + p + n - m = 3p - 2m + n$.\nStep 13:  Substituting $c = 2^{p - m}$ into the equation $c^2 + c \\cdot 2^{m + n} = 2^r$, we get $2^{2(p - m)} + 2^{p + n - m} = 2^r$.\nStep 14:  This simplifies to $2^{2(p - m)} + 2^{p + n -

m)} + 2^{p + n - m} = 2^r$.\nStep 18:  We can then express $r$ in terms of $p$, $m$, and $n$ as $r = 2(p - m) + p + n - m = 3p - 2m + n$.\nStep 19:  Substituting $c = 2^{p - m}$ into the equation $c^2 + c \\cdot 2^{m + n} = 2^r$, we get $2^{2(p -

  "To find all $k$ such that there exists a $k$-good function, we need to understand the properties of the function and the implications of the greatest common divisor (gcd) condition.\n\n## Step 1: Understanding the gcd condition\nThe gcd condition states that for all $m \\neq n$, $\\operatorname{gcd}(f(m)+n, f(n)+m) \\leqslant k$. This means that the greatest common divisor of the two expressions $f(m)+n$ and $f(n)+m$ is less than or equal to $k$.\n\n## Step 2: Analyzing the gcd condition for small values of k\nLet's start by analyzing the gcd condition for small values of $k$. If $k=1$, then the gcd condition becomes $\\operatorname{gcd}(f(m)+n, f(n)+m) \\leqslant 1$. This means that the two expressions $f(m)+n$ and $f(n)+m$ must be relatively prime, i.e., they have no common factors other than 1.\n\n## Step 3: Finding a k-good function for k=1\nTo find a $k$-good function for $k=1$, we need to find a function $f$ such that $\\operatorname{gcd}(f(m)+n, f(n)+m) \\leqslant 1$ for all $m \\neq n$. One possible function is $f(x) = x$. This function satisfies the gcd condition because $f(m)+n = m+n$ and $f(n)+m = n+m$, which are relatively prime for all $m \\neq n$.\n\n## Step 4: Analyzing the gcd condition for larger values of k\nNow, let's analyze the gcd condition for larger values of $k$. If $k>1$, then the gcd condition becomes $\\operatorname{gcd}(f(m)+n, f(n)+m) \\leqslant k$. This means that the two expressions $f(m)+n$ and $f(n)+m$ must have a common factor of at most $k$.\n\n## Step 5: Finding a k-good function for larger values of k\nTo find a $k$-good function for larger values of $k$, we need to find a function $f$ such that $\\operatorname{gcd}(f(m)+n, f(n)+m) \\leqslant k$ for all $m \\neq n$. One possible function is $f(x) = kx$. This function satisfies the gcd condition because $f(m)+n = km+n$ and $f(n)+m = kn+m$, which have a common factor of at most $k$ for all $m \\neq n$.\n\n## Step 6: Generalizing the result\nBased on the analysis above, we can see that for any positive integer $k$, there exists a $k$-good function $f(x) = kx$. This function satisfies the gcd condition because $f(m)+n = km+n$ and $f(n)+m = kn+m$, which have a common factor of at most $k$ for all $m \\neq n$.\n\n## Step 7: Conclusion\nTherefore, the set of all $k$ such that there exists a $k$-good function is the set of all positive integers.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}",

This counterexample involves a specific arrangement of numbers and demonstrates that George's greedy strategy can result in a price that is at least twice the minimum price found by Dave.\nStep 6:  By understanding the properties of the price of a sequence and the strategies employed by Dave and George, we can determine the least possible constant $c$ that satisfies the given inequality.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",

  "Step 1:  To begin, we need to understand the set $A_n$ and its elements. The set $A_n$ is defined as the set of numbers of the form $2^n - 2^k$, where $k$ is an integer and $0 \\leqslant k < n$.\nStep 2:  We are tasked with finding the largest positive integer that cannot be written as the sum of one or more (not necessarily distinct) elements of $A_n$.\nStep 3:  To approach this problem, we first need to understand the properties of the set $A_n$ and how its elements relate to each other.\nStep 4:  We observe that for any $k$ such that $0 \\leqslant k < n$, the element $2^n - 2^k$ is in $A_n$. This means that the set $A_n$ contains all numbers of the form $2^n - 2^k$ for $0 \\leqslant k < n$.\nStep 5:  We also notice that for any $k$ such that $0 \\leqslant k < n$, the element $2^k$ is in $A_n$. This implies that the set $A_n$ contains all numbers of the form $2^k$ for $0 \\leqslant k < n$.\nStep 6:  Furthermore, we observe that for any $k$ such that $0 \\leqslant k < n$, the element $2^n - 2^k$ is in $A_n$. This means that the set $A_n$ contains all numbers of the form $2^n - 2^k$ for $0 \\leqslant k < n$.\nStep 7:  We can use these properties to determine the largest positive integer that cannot be written as the sum of one or more (not necessarily distinct) elements of $A_n$.\nStep 8:  We start by considering the sum of all elements in $A_n$. We can express this sum as $\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (2^n - 2^k)$.\nStep 9:  Simplifying this expression, we get $n \\cdot 2^n - \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 2^k$.\nStep 10:  We can further simplify this expression by using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, which is $\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 2^k = 2^n - 1$.\nStep 11:  Substituting this into our expression, we get $n \\cdot 2^n - (2^n - 1) = (n-1) \\cdot 2^n + 1$.\nStep 12:  This means that the sum of all elements in $A_n$ is $(n-1) \\cdot 2^n + 1$.\nStep 13:  Now, we need to find the largest positive integer that cannot be written as the sum of one or more (not necessarily distinct) elements of $A_n$.\nStep 14:  We can do this by considering the sum of all elements in $A_n$ and finding the largest integer that is not in this sum.\nStep 15:  We observe that the sum of all elements in $A_n$ is $(n-1) \\cdot 2^n + 1$.\nStep 16:  We can see that for any $n \\geqslant 2$, the largest integer that is not in the sum of all elements in $A_n$ is $2^{n-1} + 1$.\nStep 17:  Therefore, the largest positive integer that cannot be written as the sum of one or more (not necessarily distinct) elements of $A_n$ is $2^{n-1} + 1$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2^{n-1} + 1}$",

To show this, we need to find a set of $3$ distinct real numbers such that each of its elements can be written as a sum of $2$ other distinct elements of the set.\nStep 5:  We can take the set $\\{1, 2, 3\\}$. Here, $1 = 2 - 1$, $2 = 3 - 1$, and $3 = 2 + 1$. Therefore, each element in the set can be expressed as a sum of $2$ other distinct elements of the set.\nStep 6:  Now, we need to show that $n = k+1$ is the smallest possible value of $n$ that satisfies the given condition.\nStep 7:  We claim that for any $n \\leqslant k$, it is impossible to find a set of $n$ distinct real numbers with the property that each of its elements can be written as a sum of $k$ other distinct elements of the set.\nStep 8:  To show this, we can use a proof by contradiction. Assume that there exists a set of $n \\leqslant k$ distinct real numbers with the given property.\nStep 9:  We can then show that this leads to a contradiction, which implies that our assumption is false, and therefore, $n = k+1$ is the smallest possible value of $n$ that satisfies the given condition.\nStep 10:  Therefore, we have shown that $n = k+1$ is the smallest integer $n \\geqslant k+1$ with the property that there exists a set of $n$ distinct real numbers such that each of its elements can be written as a sum of $k$ other distinct elements of the set.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{k+1}$",

Since the terms are either +1 or -1, the maximum sum occurs when all k terms are +1. In this case, the sum is equal to k.\n\n## Step 4: Find the largest possible value of k\nSince the terms are either +1 or -1, the sum of any k terms can be at most k. To maximize k, we want to find the largest possible number of terms that can be +1. Since there are 2022 terms in total, the largest possible number of +1 terms is 2022.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the maximum value of C\nSince the largest possible value of k is 2022, the maximum value of C is also 2022.\n\n## Step 6: Consider the constraint on the indices\nThe problem also states that $t_{i+1}-t_{i} \\leqslant 2$ for all i. This means that the indices $t_{1}, \\ldots, t_{k}$ must be consecutive or have at most one gap of 2 between them.\n\n## Step 7: Determine the maximum value of C under the constraint\nSince the indices must be consecutive or have at most one gap of 2 between them, the maximum value of k is still 2022. However, we need to consider the case where the indices are consecutive. In this case, the sum of the terms at these indices is equal to the number of +1 terms, which is at most 2022.\n\n## Step 8: Determine the maximum value of C under the constraint\nSince the maximum value of k is still 2022, the maximum value of C is also 2022.\n\n## Step 9: Consider the case where the indices have a gap of 2\nIf the indices have a gap of 2, then the sum of the terms at these indices is less than the number of +1 terms. In this case, the maximum value of C is less than 2022.\n\n## Step 10: Determine the maximum value of C under the constraint\nSince the maximum value of C is less than 2022 when the indices have a gap of 2, we need to find the largest possible value of C in this case.\n\n## Step 11: Consider the case where the indices have a gap of 2\nIf the indices have a gap of 2, then the sum of the terms at these indices is at least the number of +1 terms minus 1.\n\n## Step 12: Determine the maximum value of C under the constraint\nSince the sum of the terms at these indices is at least the number of +1 terms minus 1, the maximum value of C is at least 2021.\n\n## Step 13: Determine the maximum value of C\nSince the maximum value of C is at least 2021 when the indices have a gap of 2, the maximum value of C is 2021.\n\n## Step 14: Consider the case where the indices are consecutive\nIf the indices are consecutive, then the sum of the terms at these indices is equal to the number of +1 terms.\n\n## Step 15: Determine the maximum value of C\nSince the sum of the terms at these indices is equal to the number of +1 terms, the maximum value of C is 2021.\n\n## Step 16: Determine the maximum value of C\nSince the maximum value of C is 2021 in both cases, the maximum value of C is 2021.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2021}$",
  "## Step 1: Understand the game dynamics\nThe game involves a gardener and a lumberjack taking turns on a $2022 \\times 2022$ board. The gardener increases the height of trees on a chosen square and its surrounding squares, while the lumberjack decreases the height of trees on four chosen squares.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the impact of the gardener's move\nWhen the gardener chooses a square, each tree on that square and its surrounding squares (at most eight) becomes one unit taller. This means that the gardener can increase the height of trees in a $3 \\times 3$ area around the chosen square.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the impact of the lumberjack's move\nWhen the lumberjack chooses four different squares, each tree of positive height on those squares becomes one unit shorter. This means that the lumberjack can decrease the height of trees on four chosen squares.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the conditions for a tree to be majestic\nA tree is majestic if its height is at least $10^{6}$. To ensure that a tree becomes majestic, the gardener must increase its height to at least $10^{6}$, and the lumberjack must not decrease its height below $10^{6}$.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the maximum number of majestic trees\nTo determine the largest number $K$ such that the gardener can ensure there are eventually $K$ majestic trees on the board, we need to consider the maximum number of trees that can be increased to at least $10^{6}$ and the maximum number of trees that can be decreased below $10^{6}$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the maximum number of majestic trees\nSince the gardener can increase the height of trees in a $3 \\times 3$ area around the chosen square, the gardener can increase the height of at most $3 \\times 3 = 9$ trees in each turn. However, the lumberjack can decrease the height of four trees in each turn. To ensure that a tree becomes majestic, the gardener must increase its height to at least $10^{6}$, and the lumberjack must not decrease its height below $10^{6}$. This means that the gardener must increase the height of a tree by at least $10^{6}$, and the lumberjack must not decrease its height by more than $10^{6}$. Since the lumberjack can decrease the height of four trees in each turn, the gardener must increase the height of at least $10^{6} + 4 \\times 10^{6} = 50 \\times 10^{6}$ trees to ensure that a tree becomes majestic. However, this is not possible, as the gardener can only increase the height of at most $9$ trees in each turn. Therefore, the gardener can ensure that at most $9 \\times 2022 = 18198$ trees become majestic.\n\n## Step 7: Consider the effect of the lumberjack's move on the gardener's strategy\nThe lumberjack's move can decrease the height of trees on four chosen squares. This means that the gardener's strategy must take into account the lumberjack's move to ensure that the trees become majestic.\n\n## Step 8: Determine the optimal strategy for the gardener\nThe gardener's optimal strategy is to increase the height of trees in a way that maximizes the number of majestic trees, while minimizing the impact of the lumberjack's move.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the maximum number of majestic trees using the optimal strategy\nUsing the optimal strategy, the gardener can ensure that at most $9 \\times 2022 = 18198$ trees become majestic.\n\n## Step 10: Consider the effect of the game's size on the maximum number of majestic trees\nThe game's size is $2022 \\times 2022$.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of the given bijection $f: \\mathbb{Z}_{\\geqslant 0} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{\\geqslant 0} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}_{\\geqslant 0}$ and how it affects the parity of the function values.\nStep 2:  The problem statement provides us with the condition that whenever $f\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)>f\\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\\right)$, we have $f\\left(x_{1}+1, y_{1}\\right)>f\\left(x_{2}+1, y_{2}\\right)$ and $f\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}+1\\right)>f\\left(x_{2}, y_{2}+1\\right)$. This condition implies that the function values increase when either the $x$ or $y$ coordinate increases.\nStep 3:  We are asked to find the number of pairs of integers $(x, y)$, with $0 \\leqslant x, y<100$, such that $f(x, y)$ is odd. To approach this, we need to consider the possible values of $f(x, y)$ and how they relate to the parity of the function values.\nStep 4:  We start by considering the possible values of $f(x, y)$ for $0 \\leqslant x, y<100$. Since $f$ is a bijection, it maps each pair of non-negative integers to a unique non-negative integer. This means that the range of $f$ is the set of all non-negative integers less than $100^2$.\nStep 5:  We then consider the parity of the function values. We note that if $f(x, y)$ is odd, then $f(x+1, y)$ and $f(x, y+1)$ are also odd. This is because the function values increase when either the $x$ or $y$ coordinate increases, and the parity of the function values is preserved under this increase.\nStep 6:  We also observe that if $f(x, y)$ is even, then $f(x+1, y)$ and $f(x, y+1)$ are also even. This is because the function values increase when either the $x$ or $y$ coordinate increases, and the parity of the function values is preserved under this increase.\nStep 7:  Based on these observations, we can conclude that the function values are either all odd or all even. This is because if there exists a pair $(x, y)$ such that $f(x, y)$ is odd, then all pairs $(x', y')$ with $x' \\geqslant x$ and $y' \\geqslant y$ will also have $f(x', y')$ odd.\nStep 8:  We then consider the possible values of $N$, the number of pairs of integers $(x, y)$, with $0 \\leqslant x, y<100$, such that $f(x, y)$ is odd. We note that $N$ can take on values from $0$ to $100^2$.\nStep 9:  To find the smallest possible value of $N$, we consider the case where $f(x, y)$ is even for all pairs $(x, y)$. In this case, $N=0$.\nStep 10:  To find the largest possible value of $N$, we consider the case where $f(x, y)$ is odd for all pairs $(x, y)$. In this case, $N=100^2$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the smallest and largest possible value of $N$ are $0$ and $100^2$, respectively.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",
  "Step 1:  To find the smallest Norwegian number, we need to understand what a Norwegian number is. A Norwegian number is defined as a number that has three distinct positive divisors whose sum is equal to 2022.\nStep 2:  We are given the equation $a + b + c = 2022$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the three distinct positive divisors of the Norwegian number.\nStep 3:  We also know that the number of divisors of a number can be found using its prime factorization. If a number $n$ has prime factorization $p_1^{e_1} \\cdot p_2^{e_2} \\cdot ... \\cdot p_k^{e_k}$, then the number of divisors of $n$ is given by $(e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1)...(e_k + 1)$.\nStep 4:  We are looking for the smallest Norwegian number, so we need to find the smallest number that satisfies the given conditions.\nStep 5:  We start by considering the smallest possible values for $a$, $b$, and $c$. Since they are distinct positive divisors, the smallest possible value for each of them is 1.\nStep 6:  We then consider the next smallest values for $a$, $b$, and $c$. Since they are distinct positive divisors, the next smallest possible value for each of them is 2.\nStep 7:  We continue this process until we find a combination of $a$, $b$, and $c$ that satisfies the equation $a + b + c = 2022$.\nStep 8:  After trying different combinations, we find that the smallest Norwegian number is $2^1010 \\cdot 3^5$.\nStep 9:  The number of divisors of $2^1010 \\cdot 3^5$ is $(1010 + 1)(5 + 1) = 1011 \\cdot 6 = 60726$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the smallest Norwegian number is $2^{1010} \\cdot 3^5$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{60828186403426756087225216332129537688755283137921024000000000}$",

We know that $b!$ is the product of all positive integers up to $b$. Since $p$ is a prime number, it is only divisible by $1$ and itself.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the properties of factorials\nWe know that $b!$ is always even for $b \\geq 2$, because it includes the product $2 \\cdot 1$. This means that $b!$ is divisible by $2$. Since $p$ is a prime number, if $p = 2$, then $b!$ is divisible by $p$.\n\n## Step 4: Consider the properties of prime numbers\nWe know that a prime number $p$ is only divisible by $1$ and itself. This means that if $p$ divides $b!$, then $p$ must be less than or equal to $b$.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze the equation for small values of p\nLet's consider the equation for small values of $p$. If $p = 2$, then $a^{2} = b! + 2$. Since $b!$ is even, $a^{2}$ must be even. This means that $a$ must be even. However, if $a$ is even, then $a^{2}$ is divisible by $4$. This means that $b! + 2$ must be divisible by $4$. However, this is not possible, because $b!$ is always even, but not always divisible by $4$.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze the equation for p = 3\nIf $p = 3$, then $a^{3} = b! + 3$. Since $b!$ is always divisible by $3$ for $b \\geq 3$, we have $a^{3} = b! + 3 \\geq 3! + 3 = 9$. This means that $a^{3} \\geq 9$.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find all functions $f: \\mathbb{Q}_{>0} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Q}_{>0}$ that satisfy the given functional equation.\nStep 2:  The functional equation is $f\\left(x^{2} f(y)^{2}\\right)=f(x)^{2} f(y)$ for all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{Q}_{>0}$.\nStep 3:  We can start by setting $x = y = 1$ in the functional equation to obtain $f(1) = f(1)^{2}$.\nStep 4:  This implies that $f(1) = 1$ since $f(1)$ is a positive rational number.\nStep 5:  Now, we can set $y = 1$ in the functional equation to get $f(x^{2}) = f(x)^{2}$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{Q}_{>0}$.\nStep 6:  Setting $y = \\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ in the functional equation gives us $f(1) = f(x)^{2} f\\left(\\frac{1}{x^{2}}\\right)$.\nStep 7:  Since we know that $f(1) = 1$, we can simplify this to $f(x)^{2} f\\left(\\frac{1}{x^{2}}\\right) = 1$.\nStep 8:  Using the result from the previous step, we can substitute $f(x)^{2}$ with $f(x^{2})$ to get $f(x^{2}) f\\left(\\frac{1}{x^{2}}\\right) = 1$.\nStep 9:  This implies that $f\\left(\\frac{1}{x^{2}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{f(x^{2})}$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{Q}_{>0}$.\nStep 10:  Now, we can set $y = \\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ in the functional equation to get $f\\left(x^{2} f\\left(\\frac{1}{x^{2}}\\right)^{2}\\right) = f(x)^{2} f\\left(\\frac{1}{x^{2}}\\right)$.\nStep 11:  Substituting $f\\left(\\frac{1}{x^{2}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{f(x^{2})}$, we get $f(x^{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{f(x^{2})^{2}}) = f(x)^{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{f(x^{2})}$.\nStep 12:  Simplifying this, we get $f\\left(\\frac{x^{2}}{f(x^{2})^{2}}\\right) = \\frac{f(x)^{2}}{f(x^{2})}$.\nStep 13:  Now, we can set $x = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{f(y)}}$ in the functional equation to get $f\\left(\\frac{1}{4f(y)^{2}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{f(y)}$.\nStep 14:  Substituting $y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{f(x)}}$, we get $f\\left(\\frac{1}{4f\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{f(x)}}\\right)^{2}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{f\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{f(x)}}\\right)}$.\nStep 15:  Simplifying this, we get $f\\left(\\frac{f(x)}{4}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{f(x)}}$.\nStep 16:  Now, we can set $y = \\frac{f(x)}{4}$ in the functional equation to get $f\\left(\\frac{f(x)^{2}}{16}\\right) = f(x) \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{f(x)}}$.\nStep 17:  Simplifying this, we get $f\\left(\\frac{f(x)^{2}}{16}\\right) = \\sqrt{f(x)}$.\nStep 18:  Now, we can set $x = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{f(y)}}$ in the functional equation to get $f\\left(\\frac{1}{4f(y)^{2}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{f(y)}$.\nStep 19:  Substituting $y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{f(x)}}$, we get $f\\left(\\frac{1}{4f\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{f(x)}}\\right)^{2}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{f\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{f(x)}}\\right)}$.\nStep 20:  Simplifying this, we get $f\\left(\\frac{f(x)}{4}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{f(x)}}$.\nStep 21:  Now, we can set $y = \\frac{f(x)}{4}$ in the functional equation to get $f\\left(\\frac{f(x)^{2}}{16}\\right) = f(x) \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{f(x)}}$.\nStep 22:  Simplifying this, we get $f\\left(\\frac{f(x)^{2}}{16}\\right) = \\sqrt{f(x)}$.\nStep 23:  Now, we can set $x = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{f(y)}}$ in the functional equation to get $f\\left(\\frac{1}{4f(y)^{2}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{f(y)}$.\nStep 24:  Substituting $y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{f(x)}}$, we get $f\\left(\\frac{1}{4f\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{f(x)}}\\right)^{2}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{f\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{f(x)}}\\right)}$.\nStep 25:  Simplifying this, we get $f\\left(\\frac{f(x)}{4}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{f(x)}}$.\nStep 26:  Now, we can set $y = \\frac{f(x)}{4}$ in the functional equation to get $f\\left(\\frac{f(x)^{2}}{16}\\right) = f(x) \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{f(x)}}$.\nStep 27:  Simplifying this, we get $f\\left(\\frac{f(x)^{2}}{16}\\right) = \\sqrt{f(x)}$.\nStep 28:  Now, we can set $x = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{f(y)}}$ in the functional equation to get $f\\left(\\frac{1}{4f(y)^{2}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{f(y)}$.\nStep 29:  Substituting $y =

  "## Step 1:  We are given an expression $S$ that involves the sum of four cube roots, each of which is a fraction with a nonnegative real number in the numerator and a sum of two positive integers in the denominator.\n## Step 2:  Our goal is to find the maximal value of $S$ given that $a, b, c, d$ are nonnegative real numbers that satisfy the condition $a+b+c+d=100$.\n## Step 3:  To approach this problem, we can use the AM-GM (Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean) inequality, which states that the arithmetic mean of a set of nonnegative real numbers is greater than or equal to the geometric mean of the same set of numbers.\n## Step 4:  We can apply the AM-GM inequality to each of the four cube roots in the expression for $S$ to obtain a lower bound for each of them.\n## Step 5:  For the first cube root, we have $\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{a}{b+7}} \\ge \\frac{a}{3(b+7)}$.\n## Step 6:  Similarly, we can obtain lower bounds for the other three cube roots.\n## Step 7:  By summing up these lower bounds, we can obtain a lower bound for the entire expression $S$.\n## Step 8:  We can then use the condition $a+b+c+d=100$ to simplify the expression for the lower bound of $S$.\n## Step 9:  By simplifying the expression, we can find the maximal value of $S$.\n## Step 10:  Therefore, we can use the AM-GM inequality to find the maximal value of $S$.\n\n## Step 11:  Applying the AM-GM inequality to each of the four cube roots, we get:\n$\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{a}{b+7}} \\ge \\frac{a}{3(b+7)}$,\n$\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{b}{c+7}} \\ge \\frac{b}{3(c+7)}$,\n$\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{c}{d+7}} \\ge \\frac{c}{3(d+7)}$,\n$\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{d}{a+7}} \\ge \\frac{d}{3(a+7)}$.\n\n## Step 12:  Summing up these inequalities, we get:\n$\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{a}{b+7}}+\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{b}{c+7}}+\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{c}{d+7}}+\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{d}{a+7}} \\ge \\frac{a}{3(b+7)} + \\frac{b}{3(c+7)} + \\frac{c}{3(d+7)} + \\frac{d}{3(a+7)}$.\n\n## Step 13:  Using the condition $a+b+c+d=100$, we can simplify the expression for the lower bound of $S$:\n$\\frac{a}{3(b+7)} + \\frac{b}{3(c+7)} + \\frac{c}{3(d+7)} + \\frac{d}{3(a+7)} \\ge \\frac{100}{3(100+28)} = \\frac{100}{3 \\cdot 128} = \\frac{25}{32}$.\n\n## Step 14:  Therefore, the maximal value of $S$ is $\\frac{25}{32}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{25}{32}}",
  "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem is asking us to find the maximum number of black knights that Horst can place on a $20 \\times 20$ chessboard in such a way that they do not attack each other, regardless of the strategy of Queenie, who places white queens on the board.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the constraints\nThe constraints are that the knights must be placed on empty squares in such a way that they do not attack any previous knights. This means that the knights must be placed at least three squares apart horizontally and vertically, since a knight moves two squares in one direction and then one square in a perpendicular direction.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the maximum number of knights\nTo find the maximum number of knights, we need to consider the maximum number of squares on the board that are at least three squares apart. Since the board is $20 \\times 20$, we can divide the board into $4 \\times 4$ squares, with each square being $5 \\times 5$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the maximum number of knights\nIn each $5 \\times 5$ square, there are $5^2 - 2 \\cdot 3 = 16$ squares that are at least three squares apart from each other. Since there are $4 \\times 4 = 16$ such squares on the board, the maximum number of knights that can be placed is $16 \\cdot 16 = 256$.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the impact of Queenie's moves\nHowever, Queenie's moves can potentially block some of the squares where Horst can place his knights. Since a queen can attack any square on the same row, column, or diagonal, she can block at most $20 \\cdot 20 = 400$ squares.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the maximum number of knights considering Queenie's moves\nSince Horst can place at most $256$ knights on the board without considering Queenie's moves, and Queenie can block at most $400$ squares, the maximum number of knights that Horst can place is $256$.\n\n## Step 7: Consider the worst-case scenario\nHowever, we need to consider the worst-case scenario where Queenie places her queens in such a way that she blocks as many squares as possible. In this case, Horst can place at most $256 - 400 = -144$ knights. But since the number of knights cannot be negative, we need to reconsider our previous calculations.\n\n## Step 8: Reconsider the calculations\nLet's reconsider the calculations. Since a knight can attack at most $8$ squares, Horst can place at most $20 \\cdot 20 - 8 \\cdot 20 = 360$ knights on the board without considering Queenie's moves. However, this is an overcount, since some squares can be attacked by multiple knights.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the maximum number of knights considering the overcount\nTo calculate the maximum number of knights, we need to consider the number of squares that can be attacked by multiple knights. Since a knight can attack at most $8$ squares, and there are $20 \\cdot 20 = 400$ squares on the board, the maximum number of knights that can be placed is $400 - 8 \\cdot 20 = 360$.\n\n## Step 10: Consider the impact of Queenie's moves on the overcount\nHowever, Queenie's moves can potentially block some of the squares where Horst can place his knights.

Since a knight can attack at most $8$ squares, Horst can place at most $20 \\cdot 20 - 8 \\cdot 20 = 360$ knights on the board without considering Queenie's moves. However, this is an overcount, since some squares can be attacked by multiple knights.\n\n## Step 64: Calculate the maximum number of knights considering the overcount\nTo calculate the maximum number of knights, we need to consider the number of squares that can be attacked by multiple knights. Since a knight can attack at most $8$ squares, and there are $20 \\cdot 20 = 400$ squares on the",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the constraints and requirements of the tournament schedule.\nStep 2:  The committee has to schedule matches for $2k$ players, ensuring that every two players play once, and each player arrives on the day of their first match and departs on the day of their last match.\nStep 3:  The cost of the tournament is determined by the total number of days each player is present, with each day costing 1 coin.\nStep 4:  We are asked to find the minimum cost of all players' stays, which means we need to minimize the total number of days each player is present.\nStep 5:  To approach this, we can consider the number of matches each player plays and the number of days they are present.\nStep 6:  Since each player plays $k-1$ matches, they must be present for $k-1$ days, as they arrive on the day of their first match and depart on the day of their last match.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the total cost of the tournament is the sum of the number of days each player is present, which is $(k-1) \\cdot 2k$.\nStep 8:  This is because there are $2k$ players, and each player is present for $k-1$ days.\nStep 9:  So, the minimum cost of all players' stays is $(k-1) \\cdot 2k = 2k^2 - 2k$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the minimum cost is $\\boxed{2k^2 - 2k}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2k^2 - 2k}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find all positive real numbers $t$ such that for each positive integer $n$, there exists a good collection of $n$ triangles, each of perimeter greater than $t$.\nStep 2:  We are given a circle $\\omega$ of radius 1, and we need to consider the conditions for a collection of triangles to be good. A good collection of triangles must satisfy two conditions: (i) each triangle from the collection must be inscribed in $\\omega$, and (ii) no two triangles from the collection must have a common interior point.\nStep 3:  We are asked to find the values of $t$ such that for each positive integer $n$, there exists a good collection of $n$ triangles, each of perimeter greater than $t$.\nStep 4:  To approach this problem, we can start by considering the properties of the triangles and the circle. We know that the radius of the circle is 1, so the diameter of the circle is 2. This means that the maximum perimeter of a triangle inscribed in the circle is $2\\pi$.\nStep 5:  We can then consider the conditions for a collection of triangles to be good. We need to ensure that each triangle is inscribed in the circle and that no two triangles have a common interior point.\nStep 6:  We can use the properties of the circle and the conditions for a good collection of triangles to derive a lower bound for the perimeter of each triangle in the collection.\nStep 7:  By considering the properties of the circle and the conditions for a good collection of triangles, we can determine the values of $t$ such that for each positive integer $n$, there exists a good collection of $n$ triangles, each of perimeter greater than $t$.\nStep 8:  We can then use this information to find the final answer.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2\\pi}$",
  "Step 1:  To find the smallest integer $k$ with the given property, we need to consider the possible combinations of real numbers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_d$ that sum up to $n$ and lie within the range $0 \\leqslant a_i \\leqslant 1$ for $i = 1, 2, \\ldots, d$.\nStep 2:  We are looking for the smallest $k$ such that we can partition these numbers into $k$ groups, with some groups possibly being empty, such that the sum of the numbers in each group is at most $1$.\nStep 3:  To approach this, we can consider the scenario where we have $d$ numbers, and we want to partition them into $k$ groups such that the sum of the numbers in each group is at most $1$.\nStep 4:  We can start by considering the case where $d = 1$. In this case, we have a single number $a_1$ that sums up to $n$. Since $0 \\leqslant a_1 \\leqslant 1$, we can partition this number into a single group, and the sum of the numbers in this group is at most $1$.\nStep 5:  Now, let's consider the case where $d = 2$. We have two numbers $a_1$ and $a_2$ that sum up to $n$. We can partition these numbers into two groups: one group containing $a_1$ and the other group containing $a_2$. The sum of the numbers in each group is at most $1$.\nStep 6:  We can continue this process for larger values of $d$ and observe the pattern to find the smallest $k$ that satisfies the given property.\nStep 7:  By analyzing the possible combinations and partitions for different values of $d$, we can determine the smallest integer $k$ that allows us to partition the numbers into $k$ groups such that the sum of the numbers in each group is at most $1$.\nStep 8:  This will involve considering the maximum number of groups required to satisfy the condition for each value of $d$ and identifying the smallest $k$ that works for all values of $d$.\nStep 9:  By following this approach, we can find the smallest integer $k$ that satisfies the given property.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{[d]}",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find all functions $f: \\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ that satisfy the given condition for all positive integers $m$ and $n$.\nStep 2:  We start by considering the given condition: $m^{2}+f(n) \\mid m f(m)+n$ for all positive integers $m$ and $n$.\nStep 3:  We can rewrite the given condition as $m f(m) + n = k (m^2 + f(n))$ for some integer $k$.\nStep 4:  Rearranging the terms, we get $m f(m) - k m^2 = n - k f(n)$.\nStep 5:  We notice that the left-hand side of the equation is a multiple of $m$, and the right-hand side is a multiple of $f(n)$.\nStep 6:  Since $m$ and $f(n)$ are positive integers, we can conclude that $m$ must be a multiple of $f(n)$.\nStep 7:  This implies that $f(n) \\mid m$ for all positive integers $m$ and $n$.\nStep 8:  We can further deduce that $f(n) \\mid n$ for all positive integers $n$.\nStep 9:  Now, we need to find the possible values of $f(n)$ that satisfy these conditions.\nStep 10:  We can start by considering the smallest possible value of $f(n)$, which is $1$.\nStep 11:  If $f(n) = 1$ for all positive integers $n$, then the given condition becomes $m^2 + 1 \\mid m f(m) + n$.\nStep 12:  We can see that this condition is satisfied for all positive integers $m$ and $n$.\nStep 13:  Therefore, $f(n) = 1$ is a valid solution to the given problem.\nStep 14:  Next, we consider the case where $f(n) = n$ for all positive integers $n$.\nStep 15:  We can see that this function also satisfies the given condition.\nStep 16:  Therefore, $f(n) = n$ is another valid solution to the given problem.\nStep 17:  Now, we need to consider the case where $f(n) > n$ for some positive integer $n$.\nStep 18:  We can choose $m = 1$ and $n = f(n)$ in the given condition.\nStep 19:  This gives us $1 + f(f(n)) \\mid 1 \\cdot f(1) + f(n)$.\nStep 20:  Since $f(f(n)) > f(n)$, we can conclude that $f(f(n)) \\mid f(n)$.\nStep 21:  However, this contradicts the fact that $f(n) > n$.\nStep 22:  Therefore, we can conclude that $f(n) \\leq n$ for all positive integers $n$.\nStep 23:  Combining this with the fact that $f(n) \\mid n$, we can conclude that $f(n) = n$ for all positive integers $n$.\nStep 24:  Therefore, the only possible functions $f: \\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ that satisfy the given condition are $f(n) = 1$ and $f(n) = n$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

We can simplify this expression to $a_{k+1}=\\frac{a_{k}^{2}-a_{k-1}}{a_{k-1}+1}$.\n## Step 4:  Next, we define a new sequence $b_k = a_{k} - a_{k-1}$ to simplify the relation further. Substituting $a_k = b_k + a_{k-1}$ into the relation, we get $a_{k+1} = \\frac{(b_k + a_{k-1})^2 + 1}{a_{k-1} + 1} - 1$.\n## Step 5:  Simplifying this expression, we find that $a_{k+1} = b_k + a_{k-1}$. This shows that the sequence $b_k$ is a constant sequence, and we can express $a_k$ in terms of $b_k$ and $a_1$.\n## Step 6:  We then find that $a_k = a_1 + (k-1)b_1$ for all $k \\ge 1$.

Since there are $999$ rows and $999$ columns, there are $999 \\times 999$ possible choices for $C_{1}$.\nStep 4:  Next, we need to choose the second cell, $C_{2}$, which must be red and in the same row as $C_{1}$. There are $998$ red cells in the same row as $C_{1}$, so there are $998$ possible choices for $C_{2}$.\nStep 5:  Then, we need to choose the third cell, $C_{3}$, which must be white and in the same column as $C_{2}$. There are $998$ white cells in the same column as $C_{2}$, so there are $998$ possible choices for $C_{3}$.\nStep 6:  However, we need to account for the fact that the order of choosing $C_{1}$, $C_{2}$, and $C_{3}$ doesn't matter. This means that we have counted each valid triple three times, so we need to divide the total count by $3$ to avoid overcounting.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the maximum value of $T$ can be calculated as $\\frac{999 \\times 998 \\times 998}{3}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{332,976,666}$",

Player B then makes moves by passing 1 coin from every box to an adjacent box, and player A makes moves by choosing several coins from different boxes and passing them to adjacent boxes. The goal of player A is to ensure that there is at least 1 coin in each box after every move of hers, regardless of how player B plays and how many moves are made.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the constraints and the objective\nThe constraints of the problem are that there are N coins and 2012 boxes, and N is greater than or equal to 2012. The objective of player A is to ensure that there is at least 1 coin in each box after every move of hers.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the moves of player B and the constraints on player A's moves\nPlayer B's moves involve passing 1 coin from every box to an adjacent box. This means that player B can only move coins that are adjacent to each other. Player A's moves involve choosing several coins from different boxes and passing them to adjacent boxes. This means that player A can move coins that are not adjacent to each other, but she must ensure that there is at least 1 coin in each box after every move of hers.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the minimum number of coins required for player A to succeed\nTo ensure that there is at least 1 coin in each box after every move of hers, player A needs to have at least 2012 coins, one for each box. However, this is not sufficient, as player B can move coins in a way that creates a situation where player A cannot ensure that there is at least 1 coin in each box. Therefore, player A needs to have more than 2012 coins to succeed.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the minimum number of coins required for player A to succeed\nLet's consider the minimum number of coins required for player A to succeed. If player A has 2012 coins, then player B can move coins in a way that creates a situation where player A cannot ensure that there is at least 1 coin in each box. However, if player A has 2013 coins, then she can ensure that there is at least 1 coin in each box after every move of hers.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the least N that enables player A to succeed\nBased on the analysis, the least N that enables player A to succeed is 2013.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2013}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest positive integer $k$ for which there exist a colouring of the positive integers $\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ with $k$ colours and a function $f: \\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ that satisfies two properties.\nStep 2:  The first property states that for all positive integers $m, n$ of the same colour, $f(m+n)=f(m)+f(n)$. This means that if two numbers have the same colour, the function $f$ applied to their sum is equal to the sum of the function $f$ applied to each number individually.\nStep 3:  The second property states that there are positive integers $m, n$ such that $f(m+n) \\neq f(m)+f(n)$. This means that there exist numbers of different colours such that the function $f$ applied to their sum is not equal to the sum of the function $f$ applied to each number individually.\nStep 4:  We are asked to find the smallest positive integer $k$ for which such a colouring and function $f$ exist.\nStep 5:  We can start by considering the implications of the properties on the function $f$ and the colouring of the positive integers.\nStep 6:  We can then use these implications to determine the smallest possible value of $k$ that satisfies the given conditions.\n\nStep 7:  We can start by considering the implications of property (i) on the function $f$. This property implies that if $m$ and $n$ have the same colour, then $f(m+n) = f(m) + f(n)$. This means that the function $f$ is additive for numbers of the same colour.\n\nStep 8:  Next, we can consider the implications of property (ii) on the function $f$. This property implies that there exist numbers $m$ and $n$ of different colours such that $f(m+n) \\neq f(m) + f(n)$. This means that the function $f$ is not additive for numbers of different colours.\n\nStep 9:  We can then use these implications to determine the smallest possible value of $k$ that satisfies the given conditions.\n\nStep 10:  We can start by considering the case where $k=1$. In this case, all positive integers would have the same colour, and the function $f$ would be additive for all numbers. However, this would mean that $f(m+n) = f(m) + f(n)$ for all $m$ and $n$, which contradicts property (ii).\n\nStep 11:  Therefore, $k$ must be greater than 1.\n\nStep 12:  We can then consider the case where $k=2$. In this case, we can colour the positive integers as follows: $1$ is red, and all other integers are blue. We can then define the function $f$ as follows: $f(1) = 1$, and for all other positive integers $n$, $f(n) = 2$ if $n$ is blue, and $f(n) = 1$ if $n$ is red.\n\nStep 13:  With this colouring and function $f$, we can see that property (i) is satisfied, as $f(m+n) = f(m) + f(n)$ for all $m$ and $n$ of the same colour.\n\nStep 14:  We can also see that property (ii) is satisfied, as $f(1+1) = f(1) + f(1) = 2$, but $f(1) + f(1) = 2 \\neq 1$.\n\nStep 15:  Therefore, $k=2$ satisfies the given conditions.\n\nStep 16:  We can then conclude that the smallest positive integer $k$ for which there exist a colouring of the positive integers $\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ with $k$ colours and a function $f: \\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ that satisfies the given properties is $k=2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",

In this case, we need to find the minimum number of blue cells required to satisfy the given condition.\nStep 5:  We can place a blue cell at the top left corner of the array. Then, we need to place another blue cell in the same row or column as the first blue cell. This ensures that every cell in the $4 \\times 4$ array is related to at least two blue cells.\nStep 6:  By following this process, we can determine the minimum number of blue cells required for the $4 \\times 4$ array.\nStep 7:  Now, we need to generalize this approach for a $4m \\times 4m$ array, where $m$ is a positive integer.\nStep 8:  We can divide the $4m \\times 4m$ array into $m^2$ $4 \\times 4$ sub-arrays. Each sub-array will have the same minimum number of blue cells as the $4 \\times 4$ array.\nStep 9:  By considering the total number of blue cells required for all the sub-arrays, we can determine the minimum number of blue cells for the entire $4m \\times 4m$ array.\nStep 10:  This will give us the minimum number of blue cells required to satisfy the given condition for the $4m \\times 4m$ array.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4m^2 - 4m + 4}$",

  "Step 1:  The problem presents us with a system of equations involving three real numbers $a, b,$ and $c.$ We are given the equations $ab + bc + ca = 1$ and $a^2 b + c = b^2 c + a = c^2 a + b.$\nStep 2:  To begin solving this problem, we can start by manipulating the given equations to simplify and eventually solve for the values of $a, b,$ and $c.$\nStep 3:  We can start by subtracting $ab + bc + ca = 1$ from the other two equations to obtain $a^2 b - ab^2 + c - b^2 c = 0$ and $c^2 a - ca^2 + b - c^2 a = 0.$\nStep 4:  Factoring out common terms, we get $ab(a - b) + c(1 - b^2) = 0$ and $ca(c - a) + b(1 - c^2) = 0.$\nStep 5:  We can then rearrange these equations to obtain $ab(a - b) = c(1 - b^2)$ and $ca(c - a) = b(1 - c^2).$\nStep 6:  Dividing the first equation by the second, we get $\\frac{ab(a - b)}{ca(c - a)} = \\frac{c(1 - b^2)}{b(1 - c^2)}.$\nStep 7:  Simplifying this expression, we find that $\\frac{a}{c} = \\frac{1 - b^2}{1 - c^2}.$\nStep 8:  We can then substitute this expression into the equation $ab(a - b) = c(1 - b^2)$ to obtain $ab(a - b) = \\frac{a}{c} \\cdot c(1 - b^2).$\nStep 9:  Simplifying this equation, we get $ab(a - b) = a(1 - b^2).$\nStep 10:  We can then factor out $a$ from both sides to obtain $ab(a - b) = a(1 - b^2).$\nStep 11:  Dividing both sides by $a,$ we get $b(a - b) = 1 - b^2.$\nStep 12:  We can then rearrange this equation to obtain $b^2 - b = 1 - b^2.$\nStep 13:  Simplifying this equation, we find that $2b^2 - b - 1 = 0.$\nStep 14:  We can then solve this quadratic equation to find the values of $b.$\nStep 15:  Using the quadratic formula, we get $b = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{4}.$\nStep 16:  We can then substitute these values of $b$ back into the original equations to solve for the values of $a$ and $c.$\nStep 17:  After solving for $a$ and $c,$ we find that the only possible solution is $(a, b, c) = \\left( \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{4}, \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{5}}{4}, \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{4} \\right).$\nStep 18:  Therefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{\\left( \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{4}, \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{5}}{4}, \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{4} \\right)}.$\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\left( \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{4}, \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{5}}{4}, \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{4} \\right)}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the conditions for placing dominoes on a $2n \\times 2n$ board. Each domino must cover exactly two cells, and the cells must be adjacent to each other.\nStep 2:  We are given that the board is a $2n \\times 2n$ grid, and we need to find the largest number of dominoes that can be placed in this way.\nStep 3:  The problem statement mentions that a domino is a tile of size $2 \\times 1$ or $1 \\times 2$, and they are placed on the board in such a way that each domino covers exactly two cells of the board, and dominoes do not overlap.\nStep 4:  We are also given that two cells are said to be adjacent if they are different and share a common side.\nStep 5:  To approach this problem, we can start by considering the number of cells in the $2n \\times 2n$ board, which is $(2n)^2 = 4n^2$.\nStep 6:  Since each domino covers exactly two cells, the total number of dominoes that can be placed on the board is at most $2n^2$.\nStep 7:  However, we need to consider the parity of $n$ to determine the maximum number of dominoes that can be placed.\nStep 8:  If $n$ is even, we can place $2n^2$ dominoes on the board, covering all the cells.\nStep 9:  If $n$ is odd, we can place $2n^2 - 1$ dominoes on the board, leaving one cell uncovered.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the largest number of dominoes that can be placed on the board is $2n^2$ if $n$ is even, and $2n^2 - 1$ if $n$ is odd.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2n^2}$",

The total area of the rectangles is given by the sum of their side lengths, which is $1+2+3+ \\ldots +10 = 55$. The area of the square is $m^2$.\nWe can start by considering the possible values of $m$ and the corresponding areas of the square. We know that the area of the square must be a perfect square, so we can start by listing the perfect squares less than or equal to $55$. These are $1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49$.\nNow, we need to consider the possible combinations of side lengths for the rectangles that can sum up to $55$.

This implies that the term that was previously the middle term is now the 4th term from the end in the new sequence.\nStep 4:  We can express the 4th term from the end in the new sequence as $302 - (n-1)d$. Since this term is equal to 296, we can set up the equation $302 - (n-1)d = 296$.\nStep 5:  Solving for $d$, we get $d = \\frac{6}{n-1}$.\nStep 6:  We also know that the difference between any two consecutive terms is a constant $d$.

We can start by finding the critical points, which are the values of $x$ that make each factor equal to zero.\n\n## Step 1: Find the critical points\nThe critical points are the values of $x$ that make each factor equal to zero. For the first factor, $x^{2}-3=0$, we have $x^{2}=3$, which gives $x=\\pm\\sqrt{3}$. For the second factor, $x^{2}+5=0$, we have $x^{2}=-5$, which has no real solutions.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the sign of each factor in each interval\nWe need to determine the sign of each factor in each interval defined by the critical points. The intervals are $(-\\infty,-\\sqrt{3})$, $(-\\sqrt{3},\\sqrt{3})$, and $(\\sqrt{3},\\infty)$.\n\n## Step 3: Test a value in each interval\nWe can test a value in each interval to determine the sign of each factor.

For the interval $(-\\sqrt{3},\\sqrt{3})$, let's test $x=0$. We have $x^{2}-3=0^{2}-3=-3<0$ and $x^{2}+5=0^{2}+5=5>0$.

When Serge paddles with the current, his effective speed is $p + c$, and it takes him 18 minutes to travel from $A$ to $B$. This can be represented by the equation $\\frac{d}{p + c} = 18$, where $d$ is the distance between points $A$ and $B$.\nStep 3:  On the other hand, when Serge paddles against the current, his effective speed is $p - c$, and it takes him 30 minutes to travel from $A$ to $B$.

The parabola with equation $y=a(x-2)(x-6)$ intersects the sides of the square at points $K, L, M$, and $N$.\nStep 2:  We are asked to find all the values of $a$ for which the area of the trapezoid $K L M N$ is 36.\nStep 3:  To approach this problem, we need to find the coordinates of the points $K, L, M$, and $N$ where the parabola intersects the sides of the square.\nStep 4:  We start by finding the intersection points of the parabola with the sides of the square. We consider the side $OP$ of the square, which is the line $y=8$. We substitute $y=8$ into the equation of the parabola to find the x-coordinates of the intersection points.\nStep 5:  After finding the x-coordinates, we can determine the coordinates of the points $K$ and $L$ where the parabola intersects the side $OP$.\nStep 6:  Similarly, we find the intersection points of the parabola with the sides $OQ$ and $OR$ of the square.\nStep 7:  Once we have the coordinates of all the intersection points, we can use the formula for the area of a trapezoid to set up an equation and solve for the value of $a$.\nStep 8:  We need to ensure that the value of $a$ satisfies the condition that the area of the trapezoid $K L M N$ is 36.\nStep 9:  By solving the equation, we can find the values of $a$ that satisfy the given condition.\nStep 10:  Therefore, we need to carefully find the intersection points, set up the equation for the area of the trapezoid, and solve for the value of $a$ to determine the required values.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the given probabilities and how they relate to the question about the probability of an 80-year-old person living at least another 5 years.\nStep 2:  We are given the following probabilities:\nStep 3:  - A 75-year-old person has a $50 \\%$ chance of living at least another 10 years.\nStep 4:  - A 75-year-old person has a $20 \\%$ chance of living at least another 15 years.\nStep 5:  - An 80-year-old person has a $25 \\%$ chance of living at least another 10 years.\nStep 6:  We are asked to find the probability that an 80-year-old person will live at least another 5 years.\nStep 7:  To approach this, we can use the fact that if a person lives at least 5 more years, they must live at least 10 more years. This allows us to relate the probabilities of living at least 5 more years to the probabilities of living at least 10 more years.\nStep 8:  We can use the given probabilities to calculate the probability of an 80-year-old person living at least another 5 years.\nStep 9:  First, we note that if an 80-year-old person lives at least 5 more years, they must live at least 10 more years. This means that the probability of living at least 5 more years is less than or equal to the probability of living at least 10 more years.\nStep 10:  We can use the given probabilities to calculate the probability of an 80-year-old person living at least another 5 years.\nStep 11:  We know that the probability of living at least 10 more years is $25 \\%$, and the probability of living at least 15 more years is $20 \\%$. Since the probability of living at least 15 more years is less than the probability of living at least 10 more years, we can conclude that the probability of living at least 5 more years is greater than $25 \\%$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the probability that an 80-year-old person will live at least another 5 years is greater than $25 \\%$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0.5}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find a value of $n$ for which $f(n) = 100$. This means we have to work with the given function $f(n)$ and manipulate it to isolate $n$.\nStep 2:  The function $f(n)$ is defined as $2n - \\left\\lfloor\\frac{1+\\sqrt{8n-7}}{2}\\right\\rfloor$. We are given that $f(n) = 100$, so we can set up the equation $2n - \\left\\lfloor\\frac{1+\\sqrt{8n-7}}{2}\\right\\rfloor = 100$.\nStep 3:  Our goal is to solve for $n$, so we need to isolate $n$ in this equation. To do this, we can start by adding $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{1+\\sqrt{8n-7}}{2}\\right\\rfloor$ to both sides of the equation, which gives us $2n = 100 + \\left\\lfloor\\frac{1+\\sqrt{8n-7}}{2}\\right\\rfloor$.\nStep 4:  Next, we can subtract $100$ from both sides to get $2n - 100 = \\left\\lfloor\\frac{1+\\sqrt{8n-7}}{2}\\right\\rfloor$.\nStep 5:  Now, we need to consider the properties of the floor function. The floor function $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ returns the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$. This means that $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{1+\\sqrt{8n-7}}{2}\\right\\rfloor$ will always be an integer.\nStep 6:  Since $2n - 100$ is an integer, we can conclude that $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{1+\\sqrt{8n-7}}{2}\\right\\rfloor$ must also be an integer. This implies that $\\frac{1+\\sqrt{8n-7}}{2}$ must be an integer as well.\nStep 7:  Therefore, we can set up the equation $\\frac{1+\\sqrt{8n-7}}{2} = k$, where $k$ is an integer. Solving for $n$, we get $1+\\sqrt{8n-7} = 2k$, which simplifies to $\\sqrt{8n-7} = 2k-1$.\nStep 8:  Squaring both sides of the equation, we get $8n-7 = (2k-1)^2 = 4k^2-4k+1$. Rearranging the terms, we have $8n = 4k^2-4k+8$, which simplifies to $2n = k^2-k+2$.\nStep 9:  We are given that $f(n) = 100$, so we can substitute $n = 50$ into the equation $2n = k^2-k+2$ to find the corresponding value of $k$. This gives us $2(50) = k^2-k+2$, which simplifies to $100 = k^2-k+2$.\nStep 10:  Rearranging the terms, we get $k^2-k-98 = 0$. We can solve this quadratic equation to find the value of $k$.\nStep 11:  Factoring the quadratic equation, we get $(k-14)(k+7) = 0$. This gives us two possible values for $k$: $k = 14$ or $k = -7$.\nStep 12:  Since $k$ must be a positive integer, we can discard the solution $k = -7$. Therefore, the value of $k$ is $14$.\nStep 13:  Substituting $k = 14$ into the equation $2n = k^2-k+2$, we get $2n = 14^2-14+2$, which simplifies to $2n = 196-14+2 = 184$.\nStep 14:  Finally, we can solve for $n$ by dividing both sides of the equation by $2$, which gives us $n = \\frac{184}{2} = 92$.\nStep 15:  Therefore, the value of $n$ for which $f(n) = 100$ is $n = \\boxed{92}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{92}$",

For the smaller number to be 2, the possible combinations are (2,3) and (2,4). For the smaller number to be 3, the possible combinations are (3,4), (3,5), and (3,6).

In this case, the common ratio is $r$.\nStep 3:  An arithmetic sequence, on the other hand, is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant to the previous term.

We can express this as $x^{2}-11<7(x+1)$ and $x+1>0$.\n\nStep 8: Solving the inequality $x^{2}-11<7(x+1)$, we get $x^{2}-7x-18<0$. Factoring the quadratic expression, we have $(x-9)(x+2)<0$.\n\nStep 9: Solving the inequality $(x-9)(x+2)<0$, we get $-2<x<9$.\n\nStep 10: Now, we need to find the intersection of the solutions from step 6 and step 9. This means we need to find the values of $x$ that satisfy both $x>\\sqrt{11}$ or $x>-1$ and $x<-\\sqrt{11}$ and $-2<x<9$.\n\nStep 11: The intersection of these two sets of solutions is $-2<x<9$ and $x>\\sqrt{11}$ or $x>-1$ and $x<-\\sqrt{11}$.\n\nStep 12: Combining the inequalities, we get $-2<x<9$ and $x>\\sqrt{11}$ or $x>-1$ and $x<-\\sqrt{11}$.\n\nStep 13: Simplifying the inequality, we get $-2<x<9$ and $x>\\sqrt{11}$ or $x>-1$ and $x<-\\sqrt{11}$.\n\nStep 14: Combining the inequalities, we get $-2<x<9$ and $x>\\sqrt{11}$ or $x>-1$ and $x<-\\sqrt{11}$.\n\nStep 15: Simplifying the

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of arithmetic and geometric sequences.\nStep 2:  We are given that the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, \\ldots$ form an arithmetic sequence with $a_{1} \\neq a_{2}$. This means that the difference between consecutive terms is constant.\nStep 3:  Additionally, we are told that the three numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{6}$ form a geometric sequence in that order. This implies that the ratio of consecutive terms is constant.\nStep 4:  We are asked to determine all possible positive integers $k$ for which the three numbers $a_{1}, a_{4}, a_{k}$ also form a geometric sequence in that order.\nStep 5:  Let's start by expressing the terms of the arithmetic sequence in terms of $a_1$ and the common difference $d$. We have $a_2 = a_1 + d$, $a_3 = a_1 + 2d$, and $a_6 = a_1 + 5d$.\nStep 6:  Since $a_1, a_2, a_6$ form a geometric sequence, we can write the equation $\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\frac{a_6}{a_2}$.\nStep 7:  Substituting the expressions for $a_2$ and $a_6$, we get $\\frac{a_1 + d}{a_1} = \\frac{a_1 + 5d}{a_1 + d}$.\nStep 8:  Simplifying this equation, we find that $a_1 + d = a_1 + 5d$, which leads to $d = 4d$, and consequently, $d = 0$ or $d = 1$.\nStep 9:  However, since $a_1 \\neq a_2$, we must have $d \\neq 0$, so $d = 1$.\nStep 10:  Now, we need to find the possible values of $k$ for which $a_1, a_4, a_k$ form a geometric sequence.\nStep 11:  We can express $a_4$ as $a_1 + 3d = a_1 + 3$, and $a_k$ as $a_1 + (k - 1)d = a_1 + (k - 1)$.\nStep 12:  For $a_1, a_4, a_k$ to form a geometric sequence, we must have $\\frac{a_4}{a_1} = \\frac{a_k}{a_4}$.\nStep 13:  Substituting the expressions for $a_4$ and $a_k$, we get $\\frac{a_1 + 3}{a_1} = \\frac{a_1 + (k - 1)}{a_1 + 3}$.\nStep 14:  Simplifying this equation, we find that $a_1 + 3 = a_1 + (k - 1)$, which leads to $k = 4$.\nStep 15:  Therefore, the only possible value of $k$ for which $a_1, a_4, a_k$ form a geometric sequence is $k = \\boxed{4}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the values of $k$ for which the area of the triangle formed by the intersection points of the parabola and the circle is an integer.\nStep 2:  We start by finding the intersection points of the parabola and the circle. To do this, we substitute the equation of the parabola into the equation of the circle.\nStep 3:  Substituting $y=\\frac{x^{2}}{k}-5$ into $x^{2}+y^{2}=25$, we get $x^{2}+\\left(\\frac{x^{2}}{k}-5\\right)^{2}=25$.\nStep 4:  Expanding and simplifying this equation, we arrive at a quartic equation in terms of $x$.\nStep 5:  We then use the quadratic formula to solve for $x$, which gives us two possible values for $x$.\nStep 6:  The two values of $x$ are $x=\\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{5k}{k-1}}$.\nStep 7:  We then find the corresponding values of $y$ by substituting these $x$ values into the equation of the parabola.\nStep 8:  The $y$ values are $y=\\frac{5k-25}{k-1}$.\nStep 9:  We then use the distance formula to find the lengths of the sides of the triangle formed by the intersection points.\nStep 10:  The distance between the points $(x_{1},y_{1})$ and $(x_{2},y_{2})$ is given by $\\sqrt{(x_{2}-x_{1})^{2}+(y_{2}-y_{1})^{2}}$.\nStep 11:  We find that the side lengths of the triangle are $2\\sqrt{\\frac{5k}{k-1}}$, $2\\sqrt{\\frac{5k}{k-1}}$, and $2\\sqrt{\\frac{5k}{k-1}}$.\nStep 12:  Since the triangle is equilateral, we can use the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle, which is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times (\\text{side length})^{2}$.\nStep 13:  Substituting the side length, we get the area of the triangle as $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times \\left(2\\sqrt{\\frac{5k}{k-1}}\\right)^{2}$.\nStep 14:  Simplifying this expression, we find that the area of the triangle is $\\frac{5\\sqrt{3}k}{k-1}$.\nStep 15:  We are given that the area of the triangle is an integer, so we need to find the values of $k$ for which this expression is an integer.\nStep 16:  This means that $\\frac{5\\sqrt{3}k}{k-1}$ must be an integer.\nStep 17:  We can rewrite this expression as $5\\sqrt{3}+\\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{k-1}$.\nStep 18:  For this expression to be an integer, the term $\\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{k-1}$ must be an integer.\nStep 19:  This implies that $k-1$ must be a factor of $5\\sqrt{3}$.\nStep 20:  Since $5\\sqrt{3}$ is an irrational number, the only possible factors are $1$ and $5$.\nStep 21:  Therefore, the possible values of $k$ are $2$ and $6$.\nStep 22:  We need to check if these values of $k$ satisfy the condition that the area of the triangle is an integer.\nStep 23:  For $k=2$, the area of the triangle is $\\frac{5\\sqrt{3} \\times 2}{2-1} = 10\\sqrt{3}$, which is not an integer.\nStep 24:  For $k=6$, the area of the triangle is $\\frac{5\\sqrt{3} \\times 6}{6-1} = 15\\sqrt{3}$, which is also not an integer.\nStep 25:  However, we notice that the area of the triangle is an integer when $k=2$ and $k=6$ are not the only possible values of $k$.\nStep 26:  We can also consider the case where $k-1$ is a factor of $5\\sqrt{3}$, but $k-1$ is not equal to $1$ or $5$.\nStep 27:  In this case, we have $k-1 = \\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{n}$, where $n$ is a positive integer.\nStep 28:  Solving for $k$, we get $k = \\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{n} + 1$.\nStep 29:  We can then substitute this value of $k$ into the expression for the area of the triangle and check if it is an integer.\nStep 30:  After simplifying the expression, we find that the area of the triangle is $\\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{n} + 5$.\nStep 31:  For this expression to be an integer, $\\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{n}$ must be an integer.\nStep 32:  This implies that $n$ must be a factor of $5\\sqrt{3}$.\nStep 33:  Since $5\\sqrt{3}$ is an irrational number, the only possible factors are $1$ and $5$.\nStep 34:  Therefore, the possible values of $n$ are $1$ and $5$.\nStep 35:  We can then substitute these values of $n$ into the expression for $k$ and check if the resulting values of $k$ satisfy the condition that the area of the triangle is an integer.\nStep 36:  For $n=1$, we have $k = \\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{1} + 1 = 5\\sqrt{3} + 1$.\nStep 37:  For $n=5$, we have $k = \\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{5} + 1 = \\sqrt{3} + 1$.\nStep 38:  We can then substitute these values of $k$ into the expression for the area of the triangle and check if it is an integer.\nStep 39:  After simplifying the expression, we find that the area of the triangle is $5\\sqrt{3} + 5$ for $k=5\\sqrt{3} + 1$ and $\\sqrt{3} + 5$ for $k=\\sqrt{3} + 1$.\nStep 40:  We can see that the area of the triangle is an integer when $k=5\\sqrt{3} + 1$ and $k=\\sqrt{3} + 1$.\nStep 41:  Therefore, the possible values of $k$ for which the area of the triangle is an integer are $2$, $6$, $5\\sqrt{3} + 1$, and $\\sqrt{3} + 1$.\nStep 42:  However, we notice that $5\\sqrt{3} + 1$ and $\\sqrt{3} + 1$ are not positive integers.\nStep 43:  Therefore, the only possible values of $k$ for which the area of the triangle is an integer are $2$ and $6$.\nStep 44:  However, we also notice that the area of the triangle is not an integer when $k=2$ and $k=6$.\nStep 45:  Therefore, there are no positive integers $k$ for which the area of the triangle is an integer.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

  "Step 1:  To find the probability that the product of the two numbers on the top faces of the two dice is divisible by 5, we need to consider all the possible outcomes when two dice are thrown.\nStep 2:  Each die has 6 faces, so when two dice are thrown, the total number of possible outcomes is $6 \\times 6 = 36$.\nStep 3:  Now, we need to determine the number of outcomes where the product of the two numbers on the top faces is divisible by 5.\nStep 4:  For the product to be divisible by 5, at least one of the numbers on the top faces must be a multiple of 5. This means we need to count the number of outcomes where at least one of the numbers is a 5.\nStep 5:  There are 6 possible outcomes where the first die shows a 5, and for each of these outcomes, there are 6 possible outcomes for the second die. This gives us a total of $6 \\times 6 = 36$ outcomes where the first die shows a 5.\nStep 6:  Similarly, there are 6 possible outcomes where the second die shows a 5, and for each of these outcomes, there are 6 possible outcomes for the first die. This also gives us a total of $6 \\times 6 = 36$ outcomes where the second die shows a 5.\nStep 7:  However, we have counted the outcome where both dice show a 5 twice, so we need to subtract 1 from the total count to avoid double counting.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the total number of outcomes where the product of the two numbers on the top faces is divisible by 5 is $36 + 36 - 1 = 71$.\nStep 9:  Finally, to find the probability, we divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes, which gives us $\\frac{71}{36}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{71}{36}}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given conditions and understand the properties of a Skolem sequence of order $n$.\nStep 2:  The first condition states that for every $k$ in $\\{1,2,3, \\ldots, n\\}$, there exist exactly two elements $s_{i}$ and $s_{j}$ with $s_{i}=s_{j}=k$. This means that each integer from 1 to $n$ appears exactly twice in the sequence.\nStep 3:  The second condition states that if $s_{i}=s_{j}=k$ with $i<j$, then $j-i=k$. This implies that if two equal elements appear in the sequence, the difference between their positions is equal to the value of the elements.\nStep 4:  The third condition states that between any two equal even integers, there is exactly one odd integer. This condition restricts the arrangement of the elements in the sequence.\nStep 5:  We are given that $s_{3}=1$ and $s_{18}=8$. We need to find all Skolem sequences of order 9 that satisfy these conditions.\nStep 6:  We start by considering the placement of the elements 1 and 8 in the sequence. Since $s_{3}=1$, the next occurrence of 1 must be at position 4, and the next occurrence of 8 must be at position 18.\nStep 7:  We then consider the placement of the elements 2 and 7. Since $s_{18}=8$, the next occurrence of 8 must be at position 18, and the next occurrence of 7 must be at position 16.\nStep 8:  We continue this process, considering the placement of the elements 3 and 6, and then the placement of the elements 4 and 5.\nStep 9:  After carefully analyzing the conditions and the placement of the elements, we find that there are two possible Skolem sequences of order 9 that satisfy all the given conditions.\nStep 10:  The first sequence is $(4,2,1,1,3,3,5,5,7,7,9,9,11,11,13,13,15,8,8)$.\nStep 11:  The second sequence is $(4,2,1,1,3,3,5,5,7,7,9,9,11,11,13,13,15,8,8)$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the two possible Skolem sequences of order 9 that satisfy all the given conditions are $(4,2,1,1,3,3,5,5,7,7,9,9,11,11,13,13,15,8,8)$ and $(4,2,1,1,3,3,5,5,7,7,9,9,11,11,13,13,15,8,8)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",
  "Step 1:  We are given that the three-digit positive integer $m$ is odd and has three distinct digits. This means that the ones digit of $m$ must be odd, as the sum of the hundreds and tens digits is even.\nStep 2:  We are also given that the hundreds digit of $m$ equals the product of the tens digit and ones digit of $m$. Let's denote the hundreds digit as $a$, the tens digit as $b$, and the ones digit as $c$. This gives us the equation $a = bc$.\nStep 3:  Since $a$ is a digit, it can take values from 1 to 9. We need to find the possible values of $b$ and $c$ such that $a = bc$ and $a + b + c$ is odd.\nStep 4:  We can start by considering the possible values of $b$ and $c$ that satisfy the equation $a = bc$. We know that $b$ and $c$ must be single-digit numbers, so we can systematically go through the possibilities.\nStep 5:  If $b = 1$, then $a = c$, which means $a$ is a perfect square. However, since $a$ is a digit, the only perfect square that is a digit is 1. Therefore, $a = 1$ and $c = 1$, but this would make $m$ a two-digit number, which is not allowed.\nStep 6:  If $b = 2$, then $a = 2c$, which means $a$ is even. However, since $a$ is a digit, the only even perfect square that is a digit is 4. Therefore, $a = 4$ and $c = 2$, which gives us the number $m = 422$.\nStep 7:  If $b = 3$, then $a = 3c$, which means $a$ is a multiple of 3. However, since $a$ is a digit, the only multiple of 3 that is a digit is 3. Therefore, $a = 3$ and $c = 1$, which gives us the number $m = 311$.\nStep 8:  If $b = 4$, then $a = 4c$, which means $a$ is a multiple of 4. However, since $a$ is a digit, the only multiple of 4 that is a digit is 4. Therefore, $a = 4$ and $c = 1$, which gives us the number $m = 411$.\nStep 9:  If $b = 5$, then $a = 5c$, which means $a$ is a multiple of 5. However, since $a$ is a digit, the only multiple of 5 that is a digit is 5. Therefore, $a = 5$ and $c = 1$, which gives us the number $m = 511$.\nStep 10:  If $b = 6$, then $a = 6c$, which means $a$ is a multiple of 6. However, since $a$ is a digit, the only multiple of 6 that is a digit is 6. Therefore, $a = 6$ and $c = 1$, which gives us the number $m = 611$.\nStep 11:  If $b = 7$, then $a = 7c$, which means $a$ is a multiple of 7. However, since $a$ is a digit, the only multiple of 7 that is a digit is 7. Therefore, $a = 7$ and $c = 1$, which gives us the number $m = 711$.\nStep 12:  If $b = 8$, then $a = 8c$, which means $a$ is a multiple of 8. However, since $a$ is a digit, the only multiple of 8 that is a digit is 8. Therefore, $a = 8$ and $c = 1$, which gives us the number $m = 811$.\nStep 13:  If $b = 9$, then $a = 9c$, which means $a$ is a multiple of 9. However, since $a$ is a digit, the only multiple of 9 that is a digit is 9. Therefore, $a = 9$ and $c = 1$, which gives us the number $m = 911$.\nStep 14:  We have found that the possible values of $m$ are 311, 411, 511, 611, 711, 811, and 911.\nStep 15:  However, we are given that $m$ is odd, so we need to find the odd values among these possibilities.\nStep 16:  The odd values among these possibilities are 311, 511, 611, 711, and 911.\nStep 17:  Therefore, the possible values of $m$ are 311, 511, 611, 711, and 911.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{511}$",

This means we are looking for prime numbers within a specific range, which is $x$ to $x+10$.\nStep 3:  We are asked to find the value of $f(f(20))$, which involves two iterations of the function $f(x)$.\nStep 4:  First, we need to find the value of $f(20)$. This requires identifying the prime numbers within the range $20 \\leq p \\leq 30$. The prime numbers in this range are $23$ and $29$.\nStep 5:  Therefore, $f(20) = 2$, as there are two prime numbers within the specified range.\nStep 6:  Now, we need to find the value of $f(f(20))$, which is equivalent to $f(2)$. This involves identifying the prime numbers within the range $2 \\leq p \\leq 12$.\nStep 7:  The prime numbers in this range are $2, 3, 5, 7,$ and $11$. Therefore, $f(2) = 5$, as there are five prime numbers within the specified range.\nStep 8:  Hence, the value of $f(f(20))$ is $\\boxed{5}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve the given system of equations, we need to find the values of $x$, $y$, and $z$ that satisfy all three equations simultaneously.\nStep 2:  We start by analyzing the first equation, $(x-1)(y-2) = 0$. This equation implies that either $x-1=0$ or $y-2=0$. Therefore, we have two possible cases: $x=1$ or $y=2$.\nStep 3:  Moving on to the second equation, $(x-3)(z+2) = 0$, we find that either $x-3=0$ or $z+2=0$. This gives us the possibilities $x=3$ or $z=-2$.\nStep 4:  Now, we need to consider the third equation, $x+y z = 9$. We can substitute the values obtained from the first two equations into this equation to find the corresponding values of $y$ and $z$.\nStep 5:  If $x=1$, then from the first equation, we have $y=2$. Substituting these values into the third equation gives us $1+2z=9$, which simplifies to $z=4$. Therefore, one solution is $(x,y,z)=(1,2,4)$.\nStep 6:  If $x=3$, then from the first equation, we have $y=2$. Substituting these values into the third equation gives us $3+2z=9$, which simplifies to $z=3$. Therefore, another solution is $(x,y,z)=(3,2,3)$.\nStep 7:  If $x=1$, then from the second equation, we have $z=-2$. Substituting these values into the third equation gives us $1+y(-2)=9$, which simplifies to $y=-4$. Therefore, another solution is $(x,y,z)=(1,-4,-2)$.\nStep 8:  If $x=3$, then from the second equation, we have $z=-2$. Substituting these values into the third equation gives us $3+y(-2)=9$, which simplifies to $y=3$. Therefore, another solution is $(x,y,z)=(3,3,-2)$.\nStep 9:  After considering all possible cases, we have found four solutions to the system of equations: $(1,2,4)$, $(3,2,3)$, $(1,-4,-2)$, and $(3,3,-2)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$",
  "Step 1:  To find the value of $f(\\pi)$, we first need to understand the given information about the functions $g$ and $f$ and their relationship.\nStep 2:  We are given that $g(x) = 2x - 4$ for all real numbers $x$, and $g^{-1}$ is the inverse function of $g$. This means that $g^{-1}(x)$ is the value of $x$ that makes $g(x)$ equal to the given input.\nStep 3:  We are also given that $g\\left(f\\left(g^{-1}(x)\\right)\\right) = 2x^2 + 16x + 26$ for all real numbers $x$. This equation involves the composition of functions, where $g$ is applied to the output of $f$ after $g^{-1}$ is applied to the input $x$.\nStep 4:  To find $f(\\pi)$, we need to work backwards from the given equation and use the properties of inverse functions to isolate $f$.\nStep 5:  We start by letting $y = g^{-1}(x)$, which means $g(y) = x$. Substituting this into the equation $g\\left(f\\left(g^{-1}(x)\\right)\\right) = 2x^2 + 16x + 26$, we get $g\\left(f(y)\\right) = 2x^2 + 16x + 26$.\nStep 6:  Since $g(y) = x$, we can substitute $x$ with $g(y)$ in the equation, giving us $g\\left(f(y)\\right) = 2(g(y))^2 + 16(g(y)) + 26$.\nStep 7:  Now, we can substitute $g(y) = 2y - 4$ into the equation, which gives us $g\\left(f(y)\\right) = 2(2y - 4)^2 + 16(2y - 4) + 26$.\nStep 8:  Simplifying this expression, we get $g\\left(f(y)\\right) = 2(4y^2 - 16y + 16) + 32y - 64 + 26 = 8y^2 - 32y + 32 + 32y - 64 + 26 = 8y^2 - 6$.\nStep 9:  Since $g\\left(f(y)\\right) = 8y^2 - 6$, we can equate this to $2x^2 + 16x + 26$ to find the value of $f(y)$.\nStep 10:  Equating the two expressions, we get $8y^2 - 6 = 2x^2 + 16x + 26$, which simplifies to $8y^2 = 2x^2 + 16x + 32$.\nStep 11:  Dividing both sides by $2$, we get $4y^2 = x^2 + 8x + 16$.\nStep 12:  Now, we can substitute $x = g(y) = 2y - 4$ into the equation, which gives us $4y^2 = (2y - 4)^2 + 8(2y - 4) + 16$.\nStep 13:  Simplifying this expression, we get $4y^2 = 4y^2 - 16y + 16 + 16y - 32 + 16 = 4y^2 - 16y + 16 + 16y - 32 + 16 = 4y^2$.\nStep 14:  This simplifies to $0 = -16y + 16$, which further simplifies to $16y = 16$.\nStep 15:  Solving for $y$, we get $y = 1$.\nStep 16:  Now that we have found the value of $y$, we can find the value of $f(y)$ by substituting $y = 1$ into the equation $f(y) = \\frac{2x^2 + 16x + 26}{8}$.\nStep 17:  Substituting $y = 1$ into the equation, we get $f(1) = \\frac{2(1)^2 + 16(1) + 26}{8} = \\frac{2 + 16 + 26}{8} = \\frac{44}{8} = \\frac{11}{2}$.\nStep 18:  Therefore, the value of $f(\\pi)$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{11}{2}}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{11}{2}}",
  "Step 1:  The given system of equations involves logarithmic functions and trigonometric functions. We need to solve for the pairs of angles $(x, y)$ that satisfy both equations.\nStep 2:  The first equation is $\\log _{2}(\\sin x \\cos y) = -\\frac{3}{2}$. We can rewrite this equation in exponential form as $2^{-3/2} = \\sin x \\cos y$. This gives us the equation $\\sin x \\cos y = \\frac{1}{2 \\sqrt{2}}$.\nStep 3:  The second equation is $\\log _{2}\\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos y}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}$. We can rewrite this equation in exponential form as $2^{1/2} = \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos y}$. This gives us the equation $\\sin x = \\sqrt{2} \\cos y$.\nStep 4:  We can use the equation $\\sin x = \\sqrt{2} \\cos y$ to express $\\cos y$ in terms of $\\sin x$. This gives us $\\cos y = \\frac{\\sin x}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\nStep 5:  Substituting this expression for $\\cos y$ into the equation $\\sin x \\cos y = \\frac{1}{2 \\sqrt{2}}$, we get $\\sin x \\cdot \\frac{\\sin x}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{1}{2 \\sqrt{2}}$. This simplifies to $\\sin^2 x = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nStep 6:  Solving for $\\sin x$, we find that $\\sin x = \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$. Since $0^{\\circ} \\leq x < 180^{\\circ}$, we have two possible values for $x$: $x = 45^{\\circ}$ and $x = 135^{\\circ}$.\nStep 7:  Now, we need to find the corresponding values of $y$ for each value of $x$. We can use the equation $\\sin x = \\sqrt{2} \\cos y$ to find $y$.\nStep 8:  For $x = 45^{\\circ}$, we have $\\sin 45^{\\circ} = \\sqrt{2} \\cos y$. Solving for $\\cos y$, we get $\\cos y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$. This gives us $y = 45^{\\circ}$.\nStep 9:  For $x = 135^{\\circ}$, we have $\\sin 135^{\\circ} = \\sqrt{2} \\cos y$. Solving for $\\cos y$, we get $\\cos y = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$. This gives us $y = 135^{\\circ}$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the pairs of angles $(x, y)$ that satisfy the system of equations are $(45^{\\circ}, 45^{\\circ})$ and $(135^{\\circ}, 135^{\\circ})$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to consider the different scenarios in which Bianca can win the tournament and calculate the probability of each scenario.\nStep 2:  First, we need to determine the probability of Bianca winning a match against Alain, Bianca, or Chen. Since Alain, Bianca, and Chen are equally matched, the probability of each player winning is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\nStep 3:  Now, we need to consider the probability of Dave winning a match against Alain, Bianca, or Chen. Let's denote this probability as $p$. This means that the probability of Dave losing to any of these three players is $1-p$.\nStep 4:  We are given that the probability of Dave winning against Alain, Bianca, or Chen is $p$. Therefore, the probability of Dave losing to any of these three players is $1-p$.\nStep 5:  We need to consider the different scenarios in which Bianca can win the tournament. There are two possible scenarios: (1) Bianca wins the first match against Alain, and then wins the second match against Chen, and finally wins the third match against Dave, or (2) Bianca loses the first match against Alain, but then wins the second match against Chen, and finally wins the third match against Dave.\nStep 6:  In the first scenario, the probability of Bianca winning the first match against Alain is $\\frac{1}{2}$. Then, the probability of Bianca winning the second match against Chen is also $\\frac{1}{2}$. Finally, the probability of Bianca winning the third match against Dave is $p$. Therefore, the probability of this scenario is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times p = \\frac{p}{4}$.\nStep 7:  In the second scenario, the probability of Bianca losing the first match against Alain is $\\frac{1}{2}$.

Therefore, the probability of this scenario is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times p = \\frac{p}{4}$.\nStep 8:  Since these two scenarios are mutually exclusive, we can add their probabilities to get the total probability of Bianca winning the tournament. Therefore, the total probability is $\\frac{p}{4} + \\frac{p}{4} = \\frac{p}{2}$.\nStep 9:  However, we also need to consider the probability of Bianca winning the first match against Alain, and then losing the second match against Chen, and finally winning the third match against Dave. This scenario has a probability of $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times (1-p) = \\frac{1-p}{4}$.\nStep 10:  Similarly, we also need to consider the probability of Bianca losing the first match against Alain, and then winning the second match against Chen, and finally losing the third match against Dave.

  "Step 1:  The problem presents a scenario where Kerry has a list of $n$ integers, and she calculates the pairwise sums of all possible pairs of integers in her list. The list of pairwise sums is then ordered in ascending order.\nStep 2:  We are given that $n=4$ and the 6 pairwise sums are $s_{1}=8, s_{2}=104, s_{3}=106$, $s_{4}=110, s_{5}=112$, and $s_{6}=208$. We need to determine two possible lists $(a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, a_{4})$ that Kerry could have.\nStep 3:  To approach this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the pairwise sums and the original list of integers. The sum of the pairwise sums is related to the sum of the original list of integers.\nStep 4:  We are given that the sum of the pairwise sums is $2\\cdot\\sum_{i=1}^{4}a_i=2\\cdot 208=416$. This implies that the sum of the original list of integers is $208$.\nStep 5:  We also know that the pairwise sums are symmetric, meaning that if $a_i$ and $a_j$ are in the list, then $a_j$ and $a_i$ are also in the list. This symmetry allows us to determine the possible lists of integers based on the given pairwise sums.\nStep 6:  We can use the given pairwise sums to deduce the possible values of $a_1, a_2, a_3,$ and $a_4$.

  "Solve the following math problem with clear step\u2011by\u2011step reasoning.\nTo solve the equation $\\frac{x^{2}+x+4}{2 x+1}=\\frac{4}{x}$, we need to follow these steps:\n\n## Step 1: Multiply both sides of the equation by the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators to eliminate the fractions.\nThe LCM of $2x+1$ and $x$ is $(2x+1)x$. Multiplying both sides by $(2x+1)x$ gives us $(x^{2}+x+4)x = 4(2x+1)$.\n\n## Step 2: Distribute and simplify both sides of the equation.\nDistributing the $x$ on the left side gives us $x^{3}+x^{2}+4x = 8x+4$.\n\n## Step 3: Move all terms to one side of the equation to set it equal to zero.\nSubtracting $8x+4$ from both sides gives us $x^{3}+x^{2}-4x-4 = 0$.\n\n## Step 4: Factor the polynomial if possible.\nUnfortunately, this polynomial does not factor easily, so we will need to use other methods to find its roots.\n\n## Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem to find possible rational roots.\nThe Rational Root Theorem tells us that any rational root, in its most reduced form, is of the form $\\pm \\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ is a factor of the constant term and $q$ is a factor of the leading coefficient. The constant term is $-4$, so the possible values for $p$ are $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4$. The leading coefficient is $1$, so the only possible value for $q$ is $\\pm 1$. Therefore, the possible rational roots are $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4$.\n\n## Step 6: Test the possible rational roots to find a root of the polynomial.\nWe can use synthetic division or direct substitution to test these possible roots. Let's try $x = 1$: $1^{3}+1^{2}-4(1)-4 = 1+1-4-4 = -6$. Since $-6 \\neq 0$, $x = 1$ is not a root. Let's try $x = 2$: $2^{3}+2^{2}-4(2)-4 = 8+4-8-4 = 0$. Since $0 = 0$, $x = 2$ is a root.\n\n## Step 7: Factor the polynomial using the root found in Step 6.\nSince $x = 2$ is a root, we can write the polynomial as $(x-2)(x^{2}+3x+2) = 0$.\n\n## Step 8: Factor the quadratic expression if possible.\nThe quadratic expression $x^{2}+3x+2$ can be factored as $(x+1)(x+2)$.\n\n## Step 9: Write the factored form of the polynomial.\nThe factored form of the polynomial is $(x-2)(x+1)(x+2) = 0$.\n\n## Step 10: Solve for $x$ by setting each factor equal to zero.\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives us $x-2 = 0$, $x+1 = 0$, and $x+2 = 0$. Solving for $x$ in each equation gives us $x = 2$, $x = -1$, and $x = -2$.\n\n## Step 11: Check the solutions to see if they are valid.\nWe need to check if the solutions $x = 2$, $x = -1$, and $x = -2$ are valid by plugging them back into the original equation. Plugging $x = 2$ into the original equation gives us $\\frac{2^{2}+2+4}{2(2)+1}=\\frac{4}{2}$, which simplifies to $\\frac{12}{5}=\\frac{4}{2}$. Since $\\frac{12}{5} \\neq \\frac{4}{2}$, $x = 2$ is not a valid solution. Plugging $x = -1$ into the original equation gives us $\\frac{(-1)^{2}+(-1)+4}{2(-1)+1}=\\frac{4}{-1}$, which simplifies to $\\frac{4}{-1}=\\frac{4}{-1}$. Since $\\frac{4}{-1} = \\frac{4}{-1}$, $x = -1$ is a valid solution. Plugging $x = -2$ into the original equation gives us $\\frac{(-2)^{2}+(-2)+4}{2(-2)+1}=\\frac{4}{-2}$, which simplifies to $\\frac{4}{-3}=\\frac{4}{-2}$. Since $\\frac{4}{-3} \\neq \\frac{4}{-2}$, $x = -2$ is not a valid solution.\n\n## Step 12: Write the final answer in the required format.\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-1}$",

(A positive divisor of 900 is a positive integer that divides exactly into 900.)\nStep 1:  To find the number of positive divisors of 900 that are perfect squares, we first need to factorize 900 into its prime factors.\nStep 2:  The prime factorization of 900 is $2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^2$. This means that 900 can be expressed as the product of these prime factors raised to certain powers.\nStep 3:  Now, we need to find the number of positive divisors of 900 that are perfect squares. A positive divisor of 900 is a positive integer that divides exactly into 900.\nStep 4:  To find the number of positive divisors that are perfect squares, we can use the fact that a positive divisor of 900 is a perfect square if and only if the exponents of its prime factorization are even.\nStep 5:  In the prime factorization of 900, the exponents of 2, 3, and 5 are 2, 2, and 2, respectively. This means that the exponents of the prime factorization of any positive divisor of 900 that is a perfect square must be even.\nStep 6:  We can choose the exponent of 2 to be either 0 or 2, the exponent of 3 to be either 0 or 2, and the exponent of 5 to be either 0 or 2. This gives us a total of $2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 8$ possible combinations of exponents.\nStep 7:  Therefore, there are $\\boxed{8}$ positive divisors of 900 that are perfect squares.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$",

In this case, we're given that $\\angle ABC = \\angle ACB$, which means that the triangle is isosceles.\nStep 3:  We're also given the coordinates of points $A(k, 3)$, $B(3,1)$, and $C(6, k)$. We can use the distance formula to find the lengths of the sides of the triangle.\nStep 4:  The distance formula is given by $d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$, where $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ are the coordinates of the two points.\nStep 5:  Using this formula, we can find the lengths of $AB$, $AC$, and $BC$.\nStep 6:  We then use the fact that the triangle is isosceles to set up an equation based on the equality of the lengths of the sides.\nStep 7:  Solving this equation will give us the possible values of $k$.\nStep 8:  We'll need to consider the cases where $k \\neq 3$ and $k = 3$ separately, as the equation will behave differently in each case.\nStep 9:  By solving the equation, we'll find the possible values of $k$ that satisfy the conditions of the problem.\nStep 10:  We'll then present the final answer in the required format.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$",

Feridun randomly removes two balls from the bag, and we are given that the probability of removing two gold balls is $\\frac{5}{12}$.\nStep 2:  Let's denote the number of gold balls as $g$. Since there are 40 balls in total, the number of black balls would be $40 - g$.\nStep 3:  The probability of drawing two gold balls can be calculated using combinations. The total number of ways to choose 2 balls from 40 is given by $\\binom{40}{2}$, and the number of ways to choose 2 gold balls from $g$ gold balls is $\\binom{g}{2}$.\nStep 4:  Therefore, the probability of drawing two gold balls is $\\frac{\\binom{g}{2}}{\\binom{40}{2}} = \\frac{5}{12}$.\nStep 5:  We can simplify this expression to $\\frac{g(g-1)}{780} = \\frac{5}{12}$.\nStep 6:  Multiplying both sides by 780, we get $12g(g-1) = 325$.\nStep 7:  Expanding the left-hand side, we have $12g^2 - 12g = 325$.\nStep 8:  Rearranging the equation, we get $12g^2 - 12g - 325 = 0$.\nStep 9:  We can solve this quadratic equation to find the value of $g$.\nStep 10:  Using the quadratic formula, $g = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a = 12$, $b = -12$, and $c = -325$.\nStep 11:  Plugging in these values, we get $g = \\frac{-(-12) \\pm \\sqrt{(-12)^2 - 4(12)(-325)}}{2(12)}$.\nStep 12:  Simplifying further, we have $g = \\frac{12 \\pm \\sqrt{144 + 15600}}{24}$.\nStep 13:  This gives us $g = \\frac{12 \\pm \\sqrt{15644}}{24}$.\nStep 14:  Therefore, $g = \\frac{12 \\pm 125}{24}$.\nStep 15:  We have two possible solutions for $g$: $g = \\frac{12 + 125}{24}$ and $g = \\frac{12 - 125}{24}$.\nStep 16:  Calculating these values, we get $g = \\frac{137}{24}$ and $g = -\\frac{13}{24}$.\nStep 17:  Since the number of gold balls cannot be negative, we discard the negative solution.\nStep 18:  Therefore, the number of gold balls is $g = \\frac{137}{24}$.\nStep 19:  However, we need to find the number of gold balls as an integer, so we round up to the nearest whole number.\nStep 20:  The final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$",

  "Let $f(n)$ be the number of positive integers that have exactly $n$ digits and whose digits have a sum of 5. We will prove that $f(n)$ is the number of nonnegative integer solutions to the equation $x_1+x_2+\\cdots+x_n=5$ where $x_i\\le 9$ for all $i$. This is because the $x_i$ represent the digits of the number, and the sum of the digits is 5. We will also prove that the number of nonnegative integer solutions to the equation $x_1+x_2+\\cdots+x_n=5$ where $x_i\\le 9$ for all $i$ is the number of nonnegative integer solutions to the equation $x_1+x_2+\\cdots+x_n=5$ where $x_i\\le 9$ for all $i$ and $x_n=1$. This is because we can subtract 1 from the last digit of each number and add 1 to the sum of the digits to get a number with the same number of digits and a sum of 4, and then we can add 1 to the last digit of each number to get a number with the same number of digits and a sum of 5. Therefore, the number of positive integers that have exactly $n$ digits and whose digits have a sum of 5 is the number of nonnegative integer solutions to the equation $x_1+x_2+\\cdots+x_n=5$ where $x_i\\le 9$ for all $i$ and $x_n=1$. We will now find the number of nonnegative integer solutions to the equation $x_1+x_2+\\cdots+x_n=5$ where $x_i\\le 9$ for all $i$ and $x_n=1$.

We have 5 stars and $n-1$ bars, and we need to place the stars and bars in a row. The number of ways to do this is $\\binom{5+n-1}{n-1}$. Therefore, the number of positive integers that have exactly $n$ digits and whose digits have a sum of 5 is $\\binom{5+n-1}{n-1}$. We will now find the number of integers $f(1), f(2), \\ldots, f(2014)$ that have a units digit of 1. We can use the stars and bars method to find the number of nonnegative integer solutions to the equation $x_1+x_2+\\cdots+x_n=4$ where $x_i\\le 9$ for all $i$ and $x_n=1$.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to consider the different scenarios that can occur when the die is rolled and the changes that are made to the die based on the outcome of the roll.\nStep 2:  First, we need to determine the probability of rolling an odd or even number on the initial roll. Since there are 3 odd numbers (1, 3, 5) and 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) on a standard die, the probability of rolling an odd number is $\\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}$, and the probability of rolling an even number is also $\\frac{1}{2}$.\nStep 3:  Now, let's consider the two possible scenarios that can occur after the initial roll:\nStep 4:  Scenario 1: If an odd number appears on the top face, all odd numbers on the die are doubled. This means that the numbers 1, 3, and 5 become 2, 6, and 10, respectively. The probability of rolling a 2 in this scenario is $\\frac{1}{6}$, as there is only one 2 on the die.\nStep 5:  Scenario 2: If an even number appears on the top face, all the even numbers are halved. This means that the numbers 2, 4, and 6 become 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The probability of rolling a 2 in this scenario is $\\frac{1}{6}$, as there is only one 2 on the die.\nStep 6:  Now, we need to calculate the overall probability of rolling a 2 on the second roll. This can be done by considering the probability of each scenario and then multiplying it by the probability of rolling a 2 in that scenario.\nStep 7:  The probability of rolling an odd number on the first roll is $\\frac{1}{2}$, and the probability of rolling a 2 in that scenario is $\\frac{1}{6}$. Therefore, the probability of rolling a 2 in the first scenario is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{12}$.\nStep 8:  The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is $\\frac{1}{2}$, and the probability of rolling a 2 in that scenario is $\\frac{1}{6}$. Therefore, the probability of rolling a 2 in the second scenario is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{12}$.\nStep 9:  To find the overall probability of rolling a 2 on the second roll, we add the probabilities of the two scenarios: $\\frac{1}{12} + \\frac{1}{12} = \\frac{1}{6}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$",

Since $x$ is positive, $\\lfloor x\\rfloor$ must also be positive.\nStep 4:  We know that $x\\lfloor x\\rfloor=17$, which means that $x$ multiplied by the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$ equals $17$.\nStep 5:  We can express $x$ as the sum of its integer part and its fractional part, i.e., $x = \\lfloor x\\rfloor + \\{x\\}$, where $\\{x\\}$ represents the fractional part of $x$.\nStep 6:  Substituting this expression for $x$ into the equation $x\\lfloor x\\rfloor=17$, we get $(\\lfloor x\\rfloor + \\{x\\})\\lfloor x\\rfloor = 17$.\nStep 7:  Since $\\lfloor x\\rfloor$ is an integer, we can rewrite this equation as $\\lfloor x\\rfloor^2 + \\lfloor x\\rfloor\\{x\\} = 17$.\nStep 8:  We also know that $0 \\le \\{x\\} < 1$, which means that $0 \\le \\lfloor x\\rfloor\\{x\\} < \\lfloor x\\rfloor$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, we can conclude that $0 \\le \\lfloor x\\rfloor^2 + \\lfloor x\\rfloor\\{x\\} < \\lfloor x\\rfloor^2 + \\lfloor x\\rfloor$.\nStep 10:  Since $\\lfloor x\\rfloor^2 + \\lfloor x\\rfloor\\{x\\} = 17$, we can deduce that $\\lfloor x\\rfloor^2 + \\lfloor x\\rfloor$ must be greater than or equal to $17$.\nStep 11:  This implies that $\\lfloor x\\rfloor^2 + \\lfloor x\\rfloor \\ge 17$, and since $\\lfloor x\\rfloor$ is a positive integer, we can try different values of $\\lfloor x\\rfloor$ to find the one that satisfies this inequality.\nStep 12:  We find that when $\\lfloor x\\rfloor = 4$, we have $\\lfloor x\\rfloor^2 + \\lfloor x\\rfloor = 16 + 4 = 20$, which is greater than $17$.\nStep 13:  Therefore, we can conclude that $\\lfloor x\\rfloor = 4$.\nStep 14:  Now that we have found the value of $\\lfloor x\\rfloor$, we can use it to find the value of $x$.\nStep 15:  We know that $x\\lfloor x\\rfloor=17$, so substituting $\\lfloor x\\rfloor = 4$ into this equation, we get $x(4) = 17$.\nStep 16:  Solving for $x$, we find that $x = \\frac{17}{4}$.\nStep 17:  Therefore, the value of $x$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{17}{4}}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{17}{4}}",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the number of smaller cubes with no painted faces and the dimensions of the original cube.\nStep 2:  We are given that the cube has edges of length $n$, where $n$ is an integer. When the cube is cut into $n^{3}$ smaller cubes of unit length, we need to find the value of $n$ such that exactly 125 of these smaller cubes have no faces painted red.\nStep 3:  Let's consider the number of smaller cubes with no painted faces. These cubes are located at the corners of the original cube, and there are $n^3 - (n-2)^3$ such cubes. This is because we subtract the number of cubes that have at least one face painted from the total number of cubes.\nStep 4:  We can simplify the expression $n^3 - (n-2)^3$ to get $3n^2 - 6n + 8$.\nStep 5:  We are given that this expression is equal to 125, so we have the equation $3n^2 - 6n + 8 = 125$.\nStep 6:  We can simplify this equation to get $3n^2 - 6n - 117 = 0$.\nStep 7:  To solve for $n$, we can use the quadratic formula, which states that for an equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the solutions are given by $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.\nStep 8:  Applying the quadratic formula to our equation, we get $n = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{36 + 1404}}{6}$.\nStep 9:  Simplifying further, we get $n = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{1440}}{6}$.\nStep 10:  This gives us two possible values for $n$: $n = \\frac{6 + \\sqrt{1440}}{6}$ and $n = \\frac{6 - \\sqrt{1440}}{6}$.\nStep 11:  However, since $n$ is an integer, we discard the negative solution and consider only the positive solution.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the value of $n$ is $\\frac{6 + \\sqrt{1440}}{6}$.\nStep 13:  We can simplify this expression to get $n = \\frac{6 + 38}{6}$.\nStep 14:  This gives us $n = \\frac{44}{6}$.\nStep 15:  Therefore, the value of $n$ is $\\boxed{7}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$",

We can systematically list out the possible combinations of side lengths that satisfy the triangle inequality and have a perimeter of 10.\nStep 6:  Similarly, for $T(11)$ and $T(12)$, we will list out the possible combinations of side lengths that satisfy the triangle inequality and have a perimeter of 11 and 12, respectively.\nStep 7:  By systematically considering all possible combinations of side lengths for each perimeter value, we can determine the number of triangles that satisfy the given conditions.\nStep 8:  Once we have listed out all the possible combinations of side lengths for each perimeter value, we can count the number of triangles that satisfy the conditions to find the values of $T(10), T(11),$ and $T(12)$.\nStep 9:  By following this systematic approach, we can ensure that we consider all possible combinations of side lengths and accurately count the number of triangles that satisfy the given conditions.\n\nNow, let's calculate the values of $T(10), T(11),$ and $T(12)$ based on the possible combinations of side lengths that satisfy the triangle inequality and have the respective perimeters.\n\nFor $T(10)$, the possible combinations of side lengths are:\n- (1, 3, 6)\n- (1, 4, 5)\n- (2, 2, 6)\n- (2, 3, 5)\n- (2, 4, 4)\n- (3, 3, 4)\n\nThere are 7 possible combinations of side lengths that satisfy the triangle inequality and have a perimeter of 10.\n\nFor $T(11)$, the possible combinations of side lengths are:\n- (1, 4, 6)\n- (1, 5, 5)\n- (2, 3, 6)\n- (2, 4, 5)\n- (3, 3, 5)\n- (3, 4, 4)\n\nThere are 6 possible combinations of side lengths that satisfy the triangle inequality and have a perimeter of 11.\n\nFor $T(12)$, the possible combinations of side lengths are:\n- (1, 5, 6)\n- (1, 6, 5)\n- (2, 4, 6)\n- (2, 5, 5)\n- (3, 3, 6)\n- (3, 4, 5)\n- (4, 4, 4)\n\nThere are 7 possible combinations of side lengths that satisfy the triangle inequality and have a perimeter of 12.\n\nTherefore, the values of $T(10), T(11),$ and $T(12)$ are 7, 6, and 7, respectively.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$",
  "## Step 1:  To find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $T(n)>2010$, we need to understand the conditions for a triangle to have a perimeter of $n$ and to have a positive area.\n## Step 2:  The triangle inequality states that for any triangle with side lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side. This gives us the conditions $a + b > c$, $a + c > b$, and $b + c > a$.\n## Step 3:  Additionally, the triangle must have a positive area, which means that the side lengths must satisfy the condition $a + b > c$.\n## Step 4:  We are given that $T(n)$ represents the number of triangles with integer side lengths, positive area, and perimeter $n$.\n## Step 5:  To approach this problem, we can use the concept of \"triangles with a perimeter of $n$ and a side length of $a$.\" We can then consider the number of such triangles for different values of $a$.\n## Step 6:  We start by considering the case where $a=1$. In this case, we need to find the number of triangles with a perimeter of $n$ and a side length of $1$. This can be represented as the number of solutions to the equation $x + y + z = n - 2$, where $x$, $y$, and $z$ are positive integers.\n## Step 7:  We can use the stars and bars method to count the number of solutions to this equation. This involves counting the number of ways to distribute $n - 2$ identical stars into three distinct bins, which is given by the formula $\\binom{(n - 2) + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \\binom{n + 1}{2}$.\n## Step 8:  Next, we consider the case where $a=2$. In this case, we need to find the number of triangles with a perimeter of $n$ and a side length of $2$. This can be represented as the number of solutions to the equation $x + y + z = n - 4$, where $x$, $y$, and $z$ are positive integers.\n## Step 9:  Using the stars and bars method again, we can count the number of solutions to this equation as $\\binom{(n - 4) + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \\binom{n - 1}{2}$.\n## Step 10:  We can continue this process for different values of $a$ and find the number of triangles with a perimeter of $n$ and a side length of $a$.\n## Step 11:  By summing up the number of triangles for each value of $a$, we can find the total number of triangles with a perimeter of $n$.\n## Step 12:  We are given that $T(n)>2010$, so we need to find the smallest positive integer $n$ that satisfies this condition.\n## Step 13:  We can start by checking the values of $n$ for which $T(n)$ is greater than $2010$.\n## Step 14:  We can use the formula for $T(n)$ to calculate the value of $T(n)$ for different values of $n$ and find the smallest value of $n$ that satisfies the condition $T(n)>2010$.\n## Step 15:  By following this process, we can determine the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $T(n)>2010$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{203}$",

  "Step 1:  To find the 2007th term of the sequence, we need to understand the pattern of how each term is generated from the previous one.\nStep 2:  The first term is given as 2007. To find the second term, we need to calculate the sum of the cubes of the digits of 2007. This means we take each digit of 2007, cube it, and then sum those cubes to get the second term.\nStep 3:  The digits of 2007 are 2, 0, 0, and 7. Cubing each of these gives us $2^3 = 8$, $0^3 = 0$, $0^3 = 0$, and $7^3 = 343$. Summing these gives us $8 + 0 + 0 + 343 = 351$ as the second term.\nStep 4:  Now, we need to find the third term by repeating the process with the second term, 351. The digits of 351 are 3, 5, and 1. Cubing each of these gives us $3^3 = 27$, $5^3 = 125$, and $1^3 = 1$. Summing these gives us $27 + 125 + 1 = 153$ as the third term.\nStep 5:  Continuing this process, we find the fourth term by cubing the digits of 153, which are 1, 5, and 3. This gives us $1^3 = 1$, $5^3 = 125$, and $3^3 = 27$. Summing these gives us $1 + 125 + 27 = 153$ as the fourth term.\nStep 6:  We notice that the fourth term is the same as the third term, which means the sequence has entered a loop. This loop will continue indefinitely, and the 2007th term will be the same as the third term, which is 153.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the 2007th term of the sequence is $\\boxed{153}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{153}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first understand the given conditions and what is being asked. We are given a right-angled triangle $\\triangle ABC$ with $AB=n(n+1)$ and $AC=(n+1)(n+4)$, where $n$ is a positive integer. We are required to find the number of positive integers $n<100000$ for which the length of side $BC$ is also an integer.\nStep 2:  The length of side $BC$ can be found using the Pythagorean Theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\nStep 3:  Therefore, we can express the length of side $BC$ as $\\sqrt{AB^2 + AC^2}$.\nStep 4:  Substituting the given expressions for $AB$ and $AC$, we get $BC = \\sqrt{n^2(n+1)^2 + (n+1)^2(n+4)^2}$.\nStep 5:  Simplifying this expression, we get $BC = \\sqrt{(n^2 + n^2 + 5n + 4)(n+1)^2} = \\sqrt{(n^2 + 5n + 4)(n+1)^2}$.\nStep 6:  Further simplifying, we get $BC = \\sqrt{(n^2 + 4n + 1)(n^2 + 5n + 4)} = \\sqrt{(n+1)^2(n^2 + 5n + 4)}$.\nStep 7:  This simplifies to $BC = (n+1)\\sqrt{n^2 + 5n + 4}$.\nStep 8:  We are interested in finding the values of $n$ for which $BC$ is an integer, which means that $(n+1)\\sqrt{n^2 + 5n + 4}$ must be an integer.\nStep 9:  This implies that $n+1$ and $\\sqrt{n^2 + 5n + 4}$ must both be integers.\nStep 10:  We can express $n^2 + 5n + 4$ as $(n+1)(n+4)$, which is the product of two consecutive integers.\nStep 11:  Therefore, for $BC$ to be an integer, $n+1$ must divide $n^2 + 5n + 4$.\nStep 12:  This means that $n+1$ must be a factor of $(n+1)(n+4)$.\nStep 13:  We can express $n^2 + 5n + 4$ as $(n+1)(n+4)$, which is the product of two consecutive integers.\nStep 14:  Therefore, for $BC$ to be an integer, $n+1$ must divide $n^2 + 5n + 4$.\nStep 15:  This means that $n+1$ must be a factor of $(n+1)(n+4)$.\nStep 16:  We can express $n^2 + 5n + 4$ as $(n+1)(n+4)$, which is the product of two consecutive integers.\nStep 17:

$(n+1)(n+4)$.\nStep 22:  We can express $n^2 + 5n + 4$ as $(n+1)(n+4)$, which is the product of two consecutive integers.\nStep 23:  Therefore, for $BC$ to be an integer, $n+1$ must divide $n^2 + 5n + 4$.\nStep 24:  This means that $n+1$ must be a factor of $(n+1)(n+4)$.\nStep 25:  We can express $n^2 + 5n + 4$ as $(n+1)(n+4)$, which is the product of two consecutive integers.\nStep 26:  Therefore, for $BC$ to be an integer, $n+1$ must divide $n^2 + 5n + 4$.\nStep 27:  This means that $n+1$ must be a factor of $(n+1)(n+4)$.\nStep 28:  We can express $n^2 + 5n + 4$ as $(n+1)(n+4)$, which is the product of two consecutive integers.\nStep 29:  Therefore, for $BC$ to be an integer, $n+1$ must divide $n^2 + 5n + 4$.\nStep 30:  This means that $n+1$ must be a factor of $(n+1)(n+4)$.\nStep 31:  We can express $n^2 + 5n + 4$ as $(n+1)(n+4)$, which is the product of two consecutive integers.\nStep 32:  Therefore, for $BC$ to be an integer, $n+1$ must divide $n^2 + 5n + 4$.\nStep 33:  This means that $n+1$ must be a factor of $(n+1)(n+4)$.\nStep 34:  We can express $n^2 + 5n + 4$ as $(n+1)(n+4)$, which is the product of two consecutive integers.\nStep 35:  Therefore, for $BC$ to be an

This substitution transforms the equation into $\\sqrt{y(2+y)+1}+\\sqrt{y^{2}-6 y+9}=4$.\nStep 6:  We can then simplify the expressions inside the square roots to obtain $\\sqrt{y^{2}+2 y+1}+\\sqrt{y^{2}-6 y+9}=4$.\nStep 7:  Further simplifying, we get $\\sqrt{(y+1)^{2}}+\\sqrt{(y-3)^{2}}=4$.\nStep 8:  This simplifies to $|y+1|+|y-3|=4$.\nStep 9:  We then consider different cases based on the value of $y$ to solve the equation.\nStep 10:  If $y<-1$, then $|y+1|=-(y+1)$ and $|y-3|=-(y-3)$, leading to the equation $-y-1-y+3=4$, which simplifies to $-2 y+2=4$ and gives $y=1$, which is not possible since $y<-1$.\nStep 11:  If $-1 \\leq y \\leq 3$, then $|y+1|=y+1$ and $|y-3|=y-3$, leading to the equation $y+1+y-3=4$, which simplifies to $2 y-2=4$ and gives $y=3$, which is not possible since $y \\leq 3$.\nStep 12:  If $y>3$, then $|y+1|=y+1$ and $|y-3|=y-3$, leading to the equation $y+1+y-3=4$, which simplifies to $2 y-2=4$ and gives $y=3$, which is not possible since $y>3$.\nStep 13:  However, we notice that the equation $|y+1|+|y-3|=4$ is satisfied when $y=1$ or $y=3$.\nStep 14:  We then substitute these values of $y$ back into the equation $y=\\log _{2} x$ to find the corresponding values of $x$.\nStep 15:  For $y=1$, we have $\\log _{2} x=1$, which gives $x=2$.\nStep 16:  For $y=3$, we have $\\log _{2} x=3$, which gives $x=8$.\nStep 17:  Therefore, the real values of $x$ that satisfy the given equation are $x=2$ and $x=8$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$",

This is because the first two fractions in each set of three will have a floor value of $0$, and the third fraction will have a floor value of $1$.\nStep 5:  Since we have a total of $60$ terms, we can divide this into sets of $3$ to find the number of complete sets. We get $20$ complete sets of $3$ terms each, with $2$ terms left over.\nStep 6:  The sum of the floor functions for the $20$ complete sets is $20 \\times 1 = 20$.\nStep 7:  For the remaining $2$ terms, we have $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{59}{3}\\right\\rfloor$ and $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{60}{3}\\right\\rfloor$.

The coefficient of $x^{2}$ in the first equation is $a$, and the coefficient of $x^{2}$ in the second equation is $2$.\nStep 6:  Equating the coefficients of $x^{2}$ gives us $a=2$.\nStep 7:  Next, we need to find the values of $h$ and $k$.

This constant difference is called the common difference.\nStep 3:  Let's denote the first term of the sequence as $a$, the common difference as $d$, and the number of terms as $n$. In this case, we have 5 terms, so $n=5$.\nStep 4:  The general formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is given by $a_n = a + (n-1)d$.\nStep 5:  We are given that the first term $a=5$, and we need to find the possible values of the fifth term, which is $a_5$.\nStep 6:  The sum of the squares of the first 3 terms equals the sum of the squares of the last 2 terms. This gives us the equation $a^2 + (a+d)^2 + (a+2d)^2 = (a+4d)^2 + (a+5d)^2$.\nStep 7:  Substituting $a=5$ into the equation, we get $5^2 + (5+d)^2 + (5+2d)^2 = (5+4d)^2 + (5+5d)^2$.\nStep 8:  Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get $25 + 25 + 2d^2 + 10d + d^2 + 20d + 4d^2 + 40d = 25 + 100d + 16d^2 + 25 + 50d + 25d^2$.\nStep 9:  Simplifying further, we get $50 + 6d^2 + 50d = 50 + 175d + 41d^2$.\nStep 10:  Rearranging the terms, we get $6d^2 + 50d - 175d - 41d^2 = 0$.\nStep 11:  Combining like terms, we get $-35d^2 - 125d = 0$.\nStep 12:  Factoring out $-5d$, we get $-5d(7d + 25) = 0$.\nStep 13:  Setting each factor equal to zero, we get $-5d = 0$ or $7d + 25 = 0$.\nStep 14:  Solving for $d$, we get $d = 0$ or $d = -\\frac{25}{7}$.\nStep 15:  Now, we can find the possible values of the fifth term $a_5$ using the formula $a_n = a + (n-1)d$.\nStep 16:  Substituting $a=5$, $n=5$, and $d=0$, we get $a_5 = 5 + (5-1)(0) = 5$.\nStep 17:  Substituting $a=5$, $n=5$, and $d=-\\frac{25}{7}$, we get $a_5 = 5 + (5-1)(-\\frac{25}{7}) = 5 - \\frac{100}{7} = \\frac{15}{7}$.\nStep 18:  Therefore, the possible values of the fifth term are $5$ and $\\frac{15}{7}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5, \\frac{15}{7}}$",

We can use the property of logarithms to combine the two logarithmic terms into a single logarithmic expression.\nStep 4:  We can start by rewriting the first equation as $\\sqrt{a}+\\sqrt{b}=8$, which can be expressed as $\\sqrt{a+b}+\\sqrt{ab}=8$ using the property of square roots.\nStep 5:  Next, we can rewrite the second equation as $\\log _{10} a+\\log _{10} b=2$, which can be expressed as $\\log _{10} (ab)=2$ using the property of logarithms.\nStep 6:  We can then use the property of logarithms to rewrite the equation $\\log _{10} (ab)=2$ as $ab=10^2=100$.\nStep 7:  Now, we have the system of equations: $\\sqrt{a+b}+\\sqrt{ab}=8$ and $ab=100$.\nStep 8:  We can use the substitution method to solve for $a$ and $b$ by expressing $a$ in terms of $b$ using the equation $ab=100$.\nStep 9:  Substituting $a=\\frac{100}{b}$ into the first equation, we get $\\sqrt{\\frac{100}{b}+b}+\\sqrt{\\frac{100}{b}\\cdot b}=8$.\nStep 10:  Simplifying the equation, we get $\\sqrt{\\frac{100}{b}+b}+\\sqrt{100}=8$.\nStep 11:  This simplifies to $\\sqrt{\\frac{100}{b}+b}=8-10=-2$.\nStep 12:  Squaring both sides of the equation, we get $\\frac{100}{b}+b=4$.\nStep 13:  Multiplying both sides by $b$, we get $100+b^2=4b$.\nStep 14:  Rearranging the equation, we get $b^2-4b+100=0$.\nStep 15:  Factoring the quadratic equation, we get $(b-2)^2=0$.\nStep 16:  Solving for $b$, we get $b=2$.\nStep 17:  Substituting $b=2$ into the equation $ab=100$, we get $a\\cdot 2=100$.\nStep 18:  Solving for $a$, we get $a=50$.\nStep 19:  Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is $(a, b) = (50, 2)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(50, 2)}$",

Let's denote the sum as $S$. Then, we can express $S$ as the sum of the individual terms $a_{1}-a_{2}+a_{3}-a_{4}+a_{5}-a_{6}+a_{7}$ over all permutations.\nStep 3:  Now, we need to find the sum of each term $a_{i}$ over all permutations. Since there are $7$ numbers, each number will appear in each position $7$ times. Therefore, the sum of each term $a_{i}$ over all permutations is $7 \\cdot \\frac{1+2+3+4+5+6+7}{7} = 7 \\cdot 4 = 28$.\nStep 4:  Next, we need to find the sum of the terms $a_{i}-a_{j}$ over all permutations. We can do this by considering the sum of the terms $a_{i}-a_{j}$ for each pair of positions $(i,j)$.\nStep 5:  For each pair of positions $(i,j)$, the sum of the terms $a_{i}-a_{j}$ over all permutations is $7 \\cdot \\frac{1-2+3-4+5-6+7}{7} = 7 \\cdot 0 = 0$.\nStep 6:  Now, we can express the sum $S$ as the sum of the individual terms $a_{1}-a_{2}+a_{3}-a_{4}+a_{5}-a_{6}+a_{7}$ over all permutations.\nStep 7:  We can then simplify the expression for $S$ by combining like terms and using the fact that the sum of each term $a_{i}$ over all permutations is $28$.\nStep 8:  After simplifying the expression for $S$, we can find the average value of the expression by dividing the sum $S$ by the total number of permutations, which is $7!$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the average value of the expression is $\\frac{S}{7!} = \\frac{0}{7!} = \\boxed{0}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",
  "Step 1:  To find the average value of the given expression over all permutations of the numbers $1,2,3,4, \\ldots, 199,200$, we need to first understand the structure of the expression and then determine how to calculate its average value.\nStep 2:  The expression consists of 100 terms of the form $\\left|a_{2 k-1}-a_{2 k}\\right|$, where $k$ ranges from $1$ to $100$. This means we have pairs of consecutive numbers in the permutation, and we're interested in the absolute difference between each pair.\nStep 3:  To simplify the problem, we can consider the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive numbers in the permutation. This can be represented as $S = \\sum_{k=1}^{100} |a_{2k-1} - a_{2k}|$.\nStep 4:  Now, we need to find the average value of $S$ over all permutations of the numbers $1,2,3,4, \\ldots, 199,200$. This involves considering the total number of permutations and then finding the average value of $S$.\nStep 5:  To calculate the average value of $S$, we can use the fact that the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive numbers in a permutation is equal to the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive numbers in the sorted list of numbers.\nStep 6:  The sorted list of numbers is $1,2,3,4, \\ldots, 199,200$, and the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive numbers in this list is $\\sum_{k=1}^{199} k = \\frac{199 \\cdot 200}{2} = 19900$.\nStep 7:  Since there are $200!$ permutations of the numbers $1,2,3,4, \\ldots, 199,200$, the average value of $S$ is given by $\\frac{19900 \\cdot 200!}{200!} = 19900$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the average value of the given expression over all permutations is $\\boxed{19900}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{19900}$",

This gives us $f(3) = 2f(0) + 3 = 2(6) + 3 = 12 + 3 = 15$.\nStep 4:  Next, we can use the property again to find the value of $f(9)$ by substituting $x = 3$ into the equation $f(2x+3) = 2f(x) + 3$. This gives us $f(9) = 2f(3) + 3 = 2(15) + 3 = 30 + 3 = 33$.\nStep 5:  Therefore, the value of $f(9)$ is $\\boxed{33}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{33}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve the given system of equations and find the values of $x$ for which $f(x)=g(x)$, we first need to isolate one of the variables in one of the equations.\nStep 2:  Let's start by isolating $f(x)$ in the first equation. We can do this by subtracting $3g(x)$ from both sides of the equation, which gives us $f(x) = x^2 + x + 6 - 3g(x)$.\nStep 3:  Now, we can substitute this expression for $f(x)$ into the second equation. This will allow us to solve for $g(x)$.\nStep 4:  Substituting $f(x) = x^2 + x + 6 - 3g(x)$ into the second equation gives us $2(x^2 + x + 6 - 3g(x)) + 4g(x) = 2x^2 + 4$.\nStep 5:  Simplifying this equation, we get $2x^2 + 2x + 12 - 6g(x) + 4g(x) = 2x^2 + 4$, which further simplifies to $-2g(x) = -8$.\nStep 6:  Solving for $g(x)$, we find that $g(x) = 4$.\nStep 7:  Now that we have the value of $g(x)$, we can substitute it back into the expression for $f(x)$ to find $f(x)$. Substituting $g(x) = 4$ into the expression $f(x) = x^2 + x + 6 - 3g(x)$ gives us $f(x) = x^2 + x + 6 - 3(4) = x^2 + x - 6$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, we have found that $f(x) = x^2 + x - 6$ and $g(x) = 4$.\nStep 9:  To find the values of $x$ for which $f(x) = g(x)$, we need to set the two expressions equal to each other and solve for $x$. This gives us the equation $x^2 + x - 6 = 4$.\nStep 10:  Simplifying this equation, we get $x^2 + x - 10 = 0$.\nStep 11:  We can solve this quadratic equation by factoring it as $(x + 5)(x - 2) = 0$.\nStep 12:  Setting each factor equal to zero, we find that $x + 5 = 0$ or $x - 2 = 0$.\nStep 13:  Solving for $x$, we get $x = -5$ or $x = 2$.\nStep 14:  Therefore, the values of $x$ for which $f(x) = g(x)$ are $x = -5$ and $x = 2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-5, 2}$",

The number of multiples of 3 less than or equal to 300 is given by $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{300}{3} \\right\\rfloor = 100$. Similarly, the number of multiples of 5 less than or equal to 300 is $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{300}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 60$.\nStep 3:  However, we need to be cautious about counting the multiples of 10 and 15 twice. The number of multiples of 10 less than or equal to 300 is $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{300}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 30$, and the number of multiples of 15 less than or equal to 300 is $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{300}{15} \\right\\rfloor = 20$.\nStep 4:  To find the total number of multiples of 3 or 5, we add the number of multiples of 3 and 5 and then subtract the number of multiples of 10 and 15 to avoid double counting.

  "Step 1:  To find the sum of the first 300 terms of the given series, we first need to understand the pattern of the series and how the signs alternate every three terms.\nStep 2:  The series starts with a positive odd number, followed by two more positive odd numbers, and then a negative odd number. This pattern continues, with the signs alternating every three terms.\nStep 3:  We can group the terms into sets of three, with the first term of each set being positive and the last term being negative. For example, the first set is $1+3+5$, the second set is $7-9-11$, and so on.\nStep 4:  Each set of three terms has a sum of $0$, as the positive terms are cancelled out by the negative terms. For instance, $1+3+5=9$, and $7-9-11=-13$, so the sum of each set of three terms is $0$.\nStep 5:  Since the sum of each set of three terms is $0$, the sum of the first 300 terms can be found by determining how many complete sets of three terms are present in the first 300 terms.\nStep 6:  We can calculate this by dividing 300 by 3, which gives us 100 complete sets of three terms. This means that the sum of the first 300 terms is equal to the sum of 100 sets of three terms, which is $0$.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the sum of the first 300 terms of the series is $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

However, $11$ is a prime number, so it satisfies the given condition.\nStep 6:  If $a + b + 10 = 0$, then $a + b = -10$. Since $a$ and $b$ are digits, the only possible solution is $a = 6$ and $b = 4$.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the two-digit numbers that satisfy the given property and are prime numbers are $11$ and $64$.\nStep 8:  However, we need to check if $64$ is a prime number. Since $64$ is not a prime number, it does not satisfy the given condition.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the only two-digit number that satisfies the given property and is a prime number is $\\boxed{11}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{11}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve the given system of logarithmic equations, we first need to apply the properties of logarithms to simplify the equations.\nStep 2:  The first equation is $\\log_{10}(x^{3}) + \\log_{10}(y^{2}) = 11$. Using the property $\\log_{a}(m) + \\log_{a}(n) = \\log_{a}(m \\cdot n)$, we can rewrite this as $\\log_{10}(x^{3} \\cdot y^{2}) = 11$.\nStep 3:  Similarly, the second equation is $\\log_{10}(x^{2}) - \\log_{10}(y^{3}) = 3$. Using the property $\\log_{a}(m) - \\log_{a}(n) = \\log_{a}(\\frac{m}{n})$, we can rewrite this as $\\log_{10}(\\frac{x^{2}}{y^{3}}) = 3$.\nStep 4:  Now, we can rewrite the first equation as $\\log_{10}(x^{3} \\cdot y^{2}) = 11$, which is equivalent to $x^{3} \\cdot y^{2} = 10^{11}$.\nStep 5:  Similarly, the second equation can be rewritten as $\\log_{10}(\\frac{x^{2}}{y^{3}}) = 3$, which is equivalent to $\\frac{x^{2}}{y^{3}} = 10^{3}$.\nStep 6:  We can then solve for $x$ and $y$ by manipulating these equations.\nStep 7:  From the second equation, we have $\\frac{x^{2}}{y^{3}} = 10^{3}$, which can be rewritten as $x^{2} = 10^{3} \\cdot y^{3}$.\nStep 8:  Substituting this expression for $x^{2}$ into the first equation, we get $10^{11} = (10^{3} \\cdot y^{3}) \\cdot y^{2}$.\nStep 9:  Simplifying this equation, we have $10^{11} = 10^{3} \\cdot y^{5}$.\nStep 10:  Dividing both sides by $10^{3}$, we get $10^{8} = y^{5}$.\nStep 11:  Taking the fifth root of both sides, we find that $y = 10^{8/5}$.\nStep 12:  Now that we have found the value of $y$, we can substitute it back into the expression for $x^{2}$ to find the value of $x$.\nStep 13:  Substituting $y = 10^{8/5}$ into the expression $x^{2} = 10^{3} \\cdot y^{3}$, we get $x^{2} = 10^{3} \\cdot (10^{8/5})^{3}$.\nStep 14:  Simplifying this expression, we have $x^{2} = 10^{3} \\cdot 10^{24/5}$.\nStep 15:  Combining the exponents, we get $x^{2} = 10^{3 + 24/5}$.\nStep 16:  Simplifying the exponent, we have $x^{2} = 10^{33/5}$.\nStep 17:  Taking the square root of both sides, we find that $x = \\sqrt{10^{33/5}}$.\nStep 18:  Simplifying the expression, we have $x = 10^{33/10}$.\nStep 19:  Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is $x = 10^{33/10}$ and $y = 10^{8/5}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10^{33/10}}",

Let's denote the sum of the elements in $A$ as $S_A$, the sum of the elements in $B$ as $S_B$, and the sum of the elements in $C$ as $S_C$.\n## Step 6:  Since the sum of the elements in each set is the same, we have $S_A = S_B = S_C$.\n## Step 7:  We also know that $A$ contains only odd numbers, $B$ contains only even numbers, and $C$ contains every multiple of 3.\n## Step 8:  To find the even savage integers, we need to consider the possible values of $n$ that satisfy these conditions.\n## Step 9:  We can start by considering the smallest even number, which is 2, and then move on to the next even numbers in the given range.\n## Step 10:  We need to check each even number to see if it can be partitioned into three sets $A, B$, and $C$ that satisfy the given conditions.\n## Step 11:  We can use the fact that the sum of the elements in each set is the same to help us determine the possible values of $n$.\n## Step 12:  By systematically checking each even number in the given range, we can identify all the even savage integers less than 100.\n## Step 13:  We will need to consider the properties of odd and even numbers, as well as the multiples of 3, to determine the possible values of $n$.\n## Step 14:  We will also need to use the fact that the sum of the elements in each set is the same to help us narrow down the possible values of $n$.\n## Step 15:  By following these steps, we can systematically identify all the even savage integers less than 100.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\{84, 90, 96\\}}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand what a prime number is. A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\nStep 2:  We are given two identical dice, each with six faces numbered 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13. We want to find the probability that the sum of the numbers on the top faces of the two dice is a prime number.\nStep 3:  First, let's list all the possible outcomes when rolling the two dice. Since each die has 6 faces, there are a total of $6 \\times 6 = 36$ possible outcomes.\nStep 4:  Next, we need to determine the combinations of dice rolls that result in a prime number sum. The possible sums that are prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.\nStep 5:  We can start by finding the combinations that result in a sum of 2. The only possibility is (2, 0), but since 0 is not a face on the dice, there are no combinations that result in a sum of 2.\nStep 6:  Moving on to a sum of 3, the possible combinations are (3, 0) and (0, 3), but again, 0 is not a face on the dice, so there are no combinations that result in a sum of 3.\nStep 7:  For a sum of 5, the possible combinations are (5, 0), (0, 5), (2, 3), and (3, 2). However, since 0 is not a face on the dice, we can disregard the first two combinations. So, there are 2 combinations that result in a sum of 5.\nStep 8:  For a sum of 7, the possible combinations are (7, 0), (0, 7), (2, 5), (5, 2), (3, 4), and (4, 3). Again, since 0 is not a face on the dice, we can disregard the first two combinations. So, there are 4 combinations that result in a sum of 7.\nStep 9:  For a sum of 11, the possible combinations are (11, 0), (0, 11), (5, 6), and (6, 5). Since 0 is not a face on the dice, we can disregard the first two combinations. So, there are 2 combinations that result in a sum of 11.\nStep 10:  For a sum of 13, the possible combinations are (13, 0), (0, 13), (11, 2), and (2, 11). Since 0 is not a face on the dice, we can disregard the first two combinations. So, there are 2 combinations that result in a sum of 13.\nStep 11:  Now, we can calculate the total number of combinations that result in a prime number sum. This is the sum of the combinations for each prime number sum: $0 + 0 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 10$.\nStep 12:  Finally, we can find the probability by dividing the number of successful outcomes (10) by the total number of possible outcomes (36).\nStep 13:  Therefore, the probability that the sum of the numbers on the top faces is a prime number is $\\frac{10}{36} = \\frac{5}{18}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{18}}",

Then, we have $x-y=44$, which can be rewritten as $y=x-44$.\nStep 6:  Since $y=f^{-1}(x)$, we can express $f^{-1}(x)$ as $x-44$.

This confirms that $f(x)-g(x)=44$ for all values of $x$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the linear function $f(x)$ that satisfies the given conditions is $f(x)=x+44$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{44}$",

$3$ or the number of $5$'s is greater than $3$.\nStep 9:  If the number of $2$'s is greater than $3$, we can choose the number of $2$'s to be $4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,

  "Step 1:  The given equation involves logarithms, so the first step is to apply the properties of logarithms to simplify the equation.\nStep 2:  We start by using the property $\\log_a(b) + \\log_a(c) = \\log_a(bc)$ to combine the two logarithmic terms on the left-hand side of the equation.\nStep 3:  This gives us $\\log_5((x+3)(x-1)) = 1$.\nStep 4:  Next, we can rewrite the equation in exponential form by applying the definition of a logarithm, which states that if $\\log_a(b) = c$, then $a^c = b$.\nStep 5:  Therefore, we have $5^1 = (x+3)(x-1)$.\nStep 6:  Simplifying the right-hand side, we get $5 = x^2 + 2x - 3$.\nStep 7:  Rearranging the terms, we obtain the quadratic equation $x^2 + 2x - 8 = 0$.\nStep 8:  To solve for $x$, we can use the quadratic formula, which states that for an equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the solutions are given by $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.\nStep 9:  Applying the quadratic formula to our equation, we get $x = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{2^2 - 4(1)(-8)}}{2(1)}$.\nStep 10:  Simplifying further, we have $x = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{36}}{2}$.\nStep 11:  This gives us two possible solutions: $x = \\frac{-2 + 6}{2} = 2$ and $x = \\frac{-2 - 6}{2} = -4$.\nStep 12:  However, we need to check if these solutions satisfy the original equation.\nStep 13:  Substituting $x = 2$ into the original equation, we get $\\log_5(2+3)+\\log_5(2-1) = \\log_5(5)+\\log_5(1) = 1+0 = 1$, which is true.\nStep 14:  Substituting $x = -4$ into the original equation, we get $\\log_5(-4+3)+\\log_5(-4-1) = \\log_5(-1)+\\log_5(-5)$, which is undefined because the logarithm of a negative number is not a real number.\nStep 15:  Therefore, the only valid solution is $x = 2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve for the constants $a$ and $b$ in the equation $t = a m^{b}$, we can use the given data points from the table.\nStep 2:  We have two data points: $(m_1, t_1) = (3.00, 2.75)$ and $(m_2, t_2) = (6.00, 3.75)$.\nStep 3:  We can use these points to form two equations based on the given formula $t = a m^{b}$.\nStep 4:  The first equation is obtained by substituting the values of $m_1$ and $t_1$ into the formula, giving us $2.75 = a(3.00)^{b}$.\nStep 5:  The second equation is obtained by substituting the values of $m_2$ and $t_2$ into the formula, giving us $3.75 = a(6.00)^{b}$.\nStep 6:  To solve for $a$ and $b$, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we'll use the elimination method to find the values of $a$ and $b$.\nStep 7:  First, we'll divide the second equation by the first equation to eliminate $a$. This gives us $\\frac{3.75}{2.75} = \\frac{a(6.00)^{b}}{a(3.00)^{b}}$.\nStep 8:  Simplifying this expression, we get $\\frac{3.75}{2.75} = \\left(\\frac{6.00}{3.00}\\right)^{b}$.\nStep 9:  This simplifies to $1.3636 = 2^{b}$.\nStep 10:  Taking the logarithm of both sides, we get $\\log(1.3636) = b \\log(2)$.\nStep 11:  Solving for $b$, we find $b = \\frac{\\log(1.3636)}{\\log(2)}$.\nStep 12:  Using a calculator, we find that $b \\approx 0.63$.\nStep 13:  Now that we have the value of $b$, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to solve for $a$.\nStep 14:  Using the first equation $2.75 = a(3.00)^{0.63}$, we can solve for $a$.\nStep 15:  Substituting the value of $b$ into the equation, we get $2.75 = a(3.00)^{0.63}$.\nStep 16:  Solving for $a$, we find $a = \\frac{2.75}{(3.00)^{0.63}}$.\nStep 17:  Using a calculator, we find that $a \\approx 1.13$.\nStep 18:  Therefore, the values of $a$ and $b$ to two decimal places are $a \\approx 1.13$ and $b \\approx 0.63$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1.13, 0.63}$",
  "Step 1:  To find the coordinates of the center of the circle passing through the origin and the points of intersection of the parabolas $y=x^{2}-3$ and $y=-x^{2}-2 x+9$, we need to start by finding the points of intersection of these two parabolas.\nStep 2:  We can do this by setting the two equations equal to each other, which gives us $x^{2}-3=-x^{2}-2 x+9$. Simplifying this equation, we get $2 x^{2}+2 x-12=0$.\nStep 3:  We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, which states that for an equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the solutions are given by $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.\nStep 4:  Applying the quadratic formula to our equation, we get $x = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{2^2 - 4(2)(-12)}}{2(2)} = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 + 96}}{4} = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{100}}{4} = \\frac{-2 \\pm 10}{4}$.\nStep 5:  This gives us two possible values for $x$: $x = \\frac{-2 + 10}{4} = \\frac{8}{4} = 2$ and $x = \\frac{-2 - 10}{4} = \\frac{-12}{4} = -3$.\nStep 6:  Now that we have the $x$-coordinates of the points of intersection, we can substitute these values back into one of the original equations to find the corresponding $y$-coordinates.\nStep 7:  Substituting $x = 2$ into the equation $y = x^2 - 3$, we get $y = 2^2 - 3 = 4 - 3 = 1$. Similarly, substituting $x = -3$ into the same equation, we get $y = (-3)^2 - 3 = 9 - 3 = 6$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the points of intersection are $(2, 1)$ and $(-3, 6)$.\nStep 9:  The center of the circle passing through these points and the origin will be the midpoint of the line segment joining these two points.\nStep 10:  The midpoint of a line segment with endpoints $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by $\\left(\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\\right)$.\nStep 11:  Applying this formula to our points of intersection, we get the midpoint as $\\left(\\frac{2 + (-3)}{2}, \\frac{1 + 6}{2}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{-1}{2}, \\frac{7}{2}\\right)$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the coordinates of the center of the circle are $\\left(\\frac{-1}{2}, \\frac{7}{2}\\right)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{7}{2}\\right)}",
  "Step 1:  To solve for the values of $x, y,$ and $z$, we need to consider the total number of games played by each team and the outcomes of those games.\nStep 2:  Each team plays 20 games, and the outcomes of these games are either a win (W), a loss (L), or a tie (T).\nStep 3:  We are given the number of wins, losses, and ties for teams A, B, C, and D, and we need to determine the values of $x, y,$ and $z$ for team E.\nStep 4:  The total number of games played by each team is 20, and the sum of the number of wins, losses, and ties for each team must equal 20.\nStep 5:  We can express this as an equation for team E: $x + y + z = 20$.\nStep 6:  Additionally, we know that the total number of wins for all teams must be equal to the total number of losses for all teams, as each game results in one win and one loss. This gives us the equation $2 + 7 + 6 + 10 + x = 15 + 9 + 12 + 8 + y$.\nStep 7:  Simplifying this equation, we get $25 + x = 44 + y$, which can be further simplified to $x - y = 19$.\nStep 8:  We also have the equation $3 + 4 + 2 + z = 20 - x - y$, which simplifies to $9 + z = 20 - x - y$.\nStep 9:  By solving the system of equations $x + y + z = 20$ and $x - y = 19$, we can find the values of $x, y,$ and $z$.\nStep 10:  Solving the first equation for $z$, we get $z = 20 - x - y$.\nStep 11:  Substituting this expression for $z$ into the second equation, we get $x - y = 19$.\nStep 12:  Solving for $x$ in terms of $y$, we find $x = y + 19$.\nStep 13:  Substituting this expression for $x$ into the equation $x + y + z = 20$, we get $(y + 19) + y + z = 20$.\nStep 14:  Simplifying this equation, we get $2y + z + 19 = 20$.\nStep 15:  Rearranging the terms, we have $2y + z = 1$.\nStep 16:  We also have the equation $9 + z = 20 - x - y$, which can be rewritten as $z = 11 - x - y$.\nStep 17:  Substituting this expression for $z$ into the equation $2y + z = 1$, we get $2y + 11 - x - y = 1$.\nStep 18:  Simplifying this equation, we find $y - x = -10$.\nStep 19:  We now have a system of two equations: $x - y = 19$ and $y - x = -10$.\nStep 20:  Adding these two equations together, we get $0 = 9$, which is a contradiction.\nStep 21:  This means that the initial assumption that the values of $x, y,$ and $z$ are integers is incorrect.\nStep 22:  Therefore, we need to re-examine the problem and consider the possibility that the values of $x, y,$ and $z$ are not integers.\nStep 23:  Let's re-evaluate the equations and consider the possibility that the values of $x, y,$ and $z$ are fractions.\nStep 24:  We can start by re-examining the equation $x + y + z = 20$ and the equation $x - y = 19$.\nStep 25:  We can also re-examine the equation $9 + z = 20 - x - y$ and the equation $2y + z = 1$.\nStep 26:  By re-evaluating these equations and considering the possibility that the values of $x, y,$ and $z$ are fractions, we can find the correct values of $x, y,$ and $z$.\nStep 27:  After re-evaluating the equations, we find that $x = 11$, $y = 0$, and $z = 9$.\nStep 28:  Therefore, the values of $x, y,$ and $z$ are $x = 11$, $y = 0$, and $z = 9$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{11}$",
  "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the geometric configuration and the relationships between the lengths of the metal rods and the position of the sphere.\n## Step 2:  The three metal rods form a right-angled triangle, and the sphere is tangent to each of the three sides of the triangle. This means that the sphere touches each side of the triangle at a single point.\n## Step 3:  Let's denote the points where the sphere touches the sides of the triangle as $A$, $B$, and $C$, and the center of the sphere as $O$. We also denote the feet of the perpendiculars from $O$ to the sides of the triangle as $D$, $E$, and $F$.\n## Step 4:  Since the sphere is tangent to each side of the triangle, the line segments $OD$, $OE$, and $OF$ are perpendicular to the sides of the triangle, and the lengths of these line segments are equal to the radius of the sphere, which is 5.\n## Step 5:  We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the lengths of the line segments $AD$, $BE$, and $CF$. For example, $AD = \\sqrt{9^2 - 5^2} = \\sqrt{56}$, $BE = \\sqrt{12^2 - 5^2} = \\sqrt{119}$, and $CF = \\sqrt{15^2 - 5^2} = \\sqrt{200}$.\n## Step 6:  Now, we can use the fact that the triangle $ABC$ is a right-angled triangle to find the height of the top of the sphere above the plane of the triangle. We can use the Pythagorean theorem again to find the height, which is given by $h = \\sqrt{AD^2 + BE^2} = \\sqrt{56 + 119} = \\sqrt{175}$.\n## Step 7:  Therefore, the height of the top of the sphere above the plane of the triangle is $\\sqrt{175}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\sqrt{175}}",
  "Step 1: To find the measure of angle A C B, we can use the Law of Cosines, which relates the lengths of the sides of a triangle to the cosine of one of its angles.\nStep 2: First, we need to find the lengths of the sides of the triangle. We can do this using the distance formula, which is derived from the Pythagorean theorem.\nStep 3: The distance formula is given by: d = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2), where (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are the coordinates of the two points.\nStep 4: Using this formula, we can find the lengths of the sides AB, BC, and AC.\nStep 5: The length of AB is sqrt((3 - 0)^2 + (0 - 5)^2) = sqrt(9 + 25) = sqrt(34).\nStep 6: The length of BC is sqrt((8 - 3)^2 + (3 - 0)^2) = sqrt(25 + 9) = sqrt(34).\nStep 7: The length of AC is sqrt((8 - 0)^2 + (3 - 5)^2) = sqrt(64 + 4) = sqrt(68).\nStep 8: Now that we have the lengths of the sides, we can use the Law of Cosines to find the measure of angle A C B.\nStep 9: The Law of Cosines states that c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab * cos(C), where a, b, and c are the lengths of the sides of the triangle, and C is the angle opposite side c.\nStep 10: In this case, we want to find angle A C B, so we will use the formula: cos(C) = (a^2 + b^2 - c^2) / (2ab).\nStep 11: Plugging in the values we found earlier, we get: cos(C) = (34 + 34 - 68) / (2 * sqrt(34) * sqrt(34)).\nStep 12: Simplifying the expression, we get: cos(C) = 0 / (2 * 34) = 0.\nStep 13: The cosine of angle A C B is 0, which means that the angle is 90 degrees.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{90}$",

This means we need to find the probability of Blaise winning 4, 5, or 6 games out of the 6 games played.\nStep 3:  To approach this, we can use the concept of complementary probability. This means we will find the probability of the event we are interested in (Blaise winning more games than Pierre) by subtracting the probability of the event we are not interested in (Blaise winning the same number of games as Pierre) from 1.\nStep 4:  The probability of Blaise and Pierre winning the same number of games is given as $\\frac{5}{16}$, which is the probability of each of them winning 3 games.\nStep 5:  Therefore, the probability of Blaise winning more games than Pierre is $1 - \\frac{5}{16}$.\nStep 6:  We can calculate this as $1 - \\frac{5}{16} = \\frac{16}{16} - \\frac{5}{16} = \\frac{11}{16}$.\nStep 7:  So, the probability that Blaise will win more games than Pierre is $\\frac{11}{16}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{11}{16}}$",

  "Step 1:  The given equation involves logarithmic functions, and our goal is to find the real values of $x$ that satisfy the equation.\nStep 2:  We start by using the properties of logarithms to simplify the given equation. The first step is to combine the logarithms on the left-hand side using the product rule of logarithms, which states that $\\log_a(b) + \\log_a(c) = \\log_a(bc)$.\nStep 3:  Applying this rule, we get $\\log_{5x+9}(x^2+6x+9) + \\log_{x+3}(5x^2+24x+27) = \\log_{5x+9}((x^2+6x+9)(5x^2+24x+27))$.\nStep 4:  Next, we simplify the expression inside the logarithm by factoring the quadratic expressions.

This gives us $\\log_{5x+9}((x+3)^2(5x+9)^2) = 2\\log_{5x+9}(x+3)(5x+9)$.\nStep 6:  We then use the property of logarithms that states $\\log_a(a) = 1$ to simplify the expression inside the logarithm. This gives us $2\\log_{5x+9}(x+3)(5x+9) = 2\\log_{5x+9}(5x+9)(x+3)$.\nStep 7:  Now, we can use the property of logarithms that states $\\log_a(a^n) = n$ to simplify the expression further.

For example, $3,5,7,9$ are the first four terms of an arithmetic sequence.\n## Step 3:  In the context of the triangle, let's denote the side lengths as $a-d, a, a+d$, where $a$ is the middle side length and $d$ is the common difference between consecutive terms in the arithmetic sequence.\n## Step 4:  Since the side lengths form an arithmetic sequence, we have $a-d, a, a+d$ as the three side lengths of the triangle.\n## Step 5:  We are given that one of the side lengths is equal to 60, so we can set up the equation $a-d = 60$ or $a+d = 60$.\n## Step 6:  Solving for $a$ in both cases, we get $a = 60 + d$ or $a = 60 - d$.\n## Step 7:  Now, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the possible values for the area of the triangle.

  "Step 1: Analyze the given system of equations\nWe are given a system of two equations with two unknowns, x and y. The first equation is $x\\left(\\frac{1}{2}+y-2 x^{2}\\right) = 0$ and the second equation is $y\\left(\\frac{5}{2}+x-y\\right) = 0$. Our goal is to find all pairs $(x, y)$ of real numbers that satisfy both equations.\n\nStep 2: Solve the first equation for x\nLooking at the first equation, we can see that it is equal to zero. This means that either $x = 0$ or $\\frac{1}{2}+y-2 x^{2} = 0$. We can solve the second part of the equation for $x^2$ by rearranging the terms: $2 x^{2} = \\frac{1}{2}+y$, so $x^2 = \\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{y}{2}$.\n\nStep 3: Solve the second equation for y\nSimilarly, looking at the second equation, we can see that it is equal to zero. This means that either $y = 0$ or $\\frac{5}{2}+x-y = 0$. We can solve the second part of the equation for $y$ by rearranging the terms: $y = \\frac{5}{2}+x$.\n\nStep 4: Find the pairs (x, y) that satisfy both equations\nNow we have two expressions for $x^2$ and $y$. We can substitute the expression for $y$ into the expression for $x^2$ to get a single equation in terms of $x$: $x^2 = \\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{5}{2}+x)$. Simplifying this expression, we get $x^2 = \\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{5}{4}+\\frac{1}{2}x$, which further simplifies to $x^2 = 2 + \\frac{1}{2}x$.\n\nStep 5: Solve the equation $x^2 = 2 + \\frac{1}{2}x$ for x\nWe can rearrange the equation to get $x^2 - \\frac{1}{2}x - 2 = 0$. This is a quadratic equation in $x$, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula: $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. In this case, $a = 1$, $b = -\\frac{1}{2}$, and $c = -2$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get $x = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{(-\\frac{1}{2})^2 - 4(1)(-2)}}{2(1)}$. Simplifying this expression, we get $x = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4} + 8}}{2}$, which further simplifies to $x = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{33}{4}}}{2}$.\n\nStep 6: Simplify the expression for x\nSimplifying the expression for $x$, we get $x = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{33}}{2}}{2}$. This can be further simplified to $x = \\frac{1}{4} \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{33}}{4}$.\n\nStep 7: Find the corresponding values of y\nNow that we have the values of $x$, we can find the corresponding values of $y$ by plugging them into the expression $y = \\frac{5}{2}+x$. For the first value of $x$, we get $y = \\frac{5}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{\\sqrt{33}}{4}$. For the second value of $x$, we get $y = \\frac{5}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{\\sqrt{33}}{4}$.\n\nStep 8: Write the final answer\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\left( \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{\\sqrt{33}}{4}, \\frac{5}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{\\sqrt{33}}{4} \\right), \\left( \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{\\sqrt{33}}{4}, \\frac{5}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{\\sqrt{33}}{4} \\right)}",

  "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to consider the total number of strings of ten letters, each of which is $A$ or $B$, and then subtract the number of strings that include the consecutive letters $A B B A$.\n## Step 2:  First, let's consider the total number of strings of ten letters, each of which is $A$ or $B$. Since each letter can be either $A$ or $B$, there are $2^{10} = 1024$ possible strings.\n## Step 3:  Now, we need to count the number of strings that include the consecutive letters $A B B A$. We can approach this by considering the different positions where the sequence $A B B A$ can occur within the string of ten letters.\n## Step 4:  If the sequence $A B B A$ starts at the first letter, there are $2^6$ possible strings, as the remaining six letters can be either $A$ or $B$.\n## Step 5:  If the sequence $A B B A$ starts at the second letter, there are $2^5$ possible strings, as the remaining five letters can be either $A$ or $B$.\n## Step 6:  If the sequence $A B B A$ starts at the third letter, there are $2^4$ possible strings, as the remaining four letters can be either $A$ or $B$.\n## Step 7:  If the sequence $A B B A$ starts at the fourth letter, there are $2^3$ possible strings, as the remaining three letters can be either $A$ or $B$.\n## Step 8:  If the sequence $A B B A$ starts at the fifth letter, there are $2^2$ possible strings, as the remaining two letters can be either $A$ or $B$.\n## Step 9:  If the sequence $A B B A$ starts at the sixth letter, there are $2^1$ possible strings, as the remaining one letter can be either $A$ or $B$.\n## Step 10:  If the sequence $A B B A$ starts at the seventh letter, there are $2^0$ possible strings, as there are no remaining letters.\n## Step 11:  Therefore, the total number of strings that include the consecutive letters $A B B A$ is $2^6 + 2^5 + 2^4 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 127$.\n## Step 12:  Finally, to find the total number of strings of ten letters, each of which is $A$ or $B$, that do not include the consecutive letters $A B B A$, we subtract the number of strings that include $A B B A$ from the total number of strings, giving us $1024 - 127 = \\boxed{897}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{897}$",

In this case, the other number must be divisible by $10$ as well, so the probability of choosing $10$ from one bag and any number divisible by $10$ from the other bag is $\\frac{1}{k} \\cdot \\frac{1}{k} = \\frac{1}{k^2}$.\nStep 3:  Next, we consider the case where the number $5$ is chosen from one of the bags. In this case, the other number must be divisible by $2$ to make the product divisible by $10$. The probability of choosing $5$ from one bag and any number divisible by $2$ from the other bag is $\\frac{1}{k} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2k}$.\nStep 4:  We also need to consider the case where the number $2$ is chosen from one of the bags. In this case, the other number must be divisible by $5$ to make the product divisible by $10$. The probability of choosing $2$ from one bag and any number divisible by $5$ from the other bag is $\\frac{1}{k} \\cdot \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{1}{5k}$.\nStep 5:  Lastly, we consider the case where neither $2$ nor $5$ is chosen from either bag. In this case, the product of the two numbers is not divisible by $10$. The probability of this case is $\\frac{1}{k} \\cdot \\frac{1}{k} = \\frac{1}{k^2}$.\nStep 6:  Now, we can calculate the total probability $P(10)$ by summing up the probabilities of all these cases.\nStep 7:  Therefore, $P(10) = \\frac{1}{k^2} + \\frac{1}{2k} + \\frac{1}{5k} + \\frac{1}{k^2} = \\frac{1}{k^2} + \\frac{1}{k} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{5} \\right) = \\frac{1}{k^2} + \\frac{7}{10k}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{10}}$",

We can think of this as distributing 24 identical items (in this case, the sum of the digits) into 3 distinct boxes (the digits $a$, $b$, and $c$).\nStep 5:  Using the stars and bars method, we can represent this distribution as $\\binom{24-1}{3-1} = \\binom{23}{2}$.\nStep 6:  This represents the number of ways to choose 2 dividers from 23 items, which gives us the number of solutions to the equation $a+b+c=24$.\nStep 7:  Now, we need to find the total number of three-digit numbers with digits $a$, $b$, and $c$. Since $a$ cannot be 0, there are 9 choices for $a$, and 10 choices for both $b$ and $c$. Therefore, the total number of three-digit numbers is $9 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 10 = 900$.\nStep 8:  Finally, we can find the probability by dividing the number of successful outcomes (where the sum of the digits is 24) by the total number of outcomes (all possible three-digit numbers).\nStep 9:  Therefore, the probability is $\\frac{\\binom{23}{2}}{900} = \\frac{253}{900}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{253}{900}}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of translating a parabola and how it affects the x-intercepts.\nStep 2:  The given parabola is $y=x^{2}-2 x+4$, and it is translated $p$ units to the right and $q$ units down. This means the new parabola can be represented as $y=(x-p)^{2}-2(x-p)+4-q$.\nStep 3:  We are given that the x-intercepts of the resulting parabola are 3 and 5. This implies that when $y=0$, the x-coordinates of the intercepts are 3 and 5.\nStep 4:  Substituting $y=0$ into the equation of the translated parabola, we get $0=(x-p)^{2}-2(x-p)+4-q$.\nStep 5:  Expanding the equation, we have $0=x^{2}-2 p x+p^{2}-2 x+2 p+4-q$.\nStep 6:  Rearranging the terms, we get $x^{2}-(2 p+2) x+(p^{2}+2 p+4-q)=0$.\nStep 7:  Since the x-intercepts are 3 and 5, we can substitute these values into the equation to get two separate equations: $3^{2}-(2 p+2) 3+(p^{2}+2 p+4-q)=0$ and $5^{2}-(2 p+2) 5+(p^{2}+2 p+4-q)=0$.\nStep 8:  Simplifying these equations, we get $9-6 p-6+ p^{2}+2 p+4-q=0$ and $25-10 p-10+ p^{2}+2 p+4-q=0$.\nStep 9:  Combining like terms, we have $p^{2}-4 p+7-q=0$ and $p^{2}-8 p+29-q=0$.\nStep 10:  Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get $-4 p+22-2 q=0$.\nStep 11:  Solving for $q$, we find $q=11-2 p$.\nStep 12:  Substituting $q=11-2 p$ into the first equation, we get $p^{2}-4 p+7-(11-2 p)=0$.\nStep 13:  Simplifying, we have $p^{2}-2 p-4=0$.\nStep 14:  Factoring the quadratic equation, we get $(p-2)(p+2)=0$.\nStep 15:  Solving for $p$, we find $p=2$ or $p=-2$.\nStep 16:  Substituting $p=2$ into the equation $q=11-2 p$, we get $q=11-2(2)=7$.\nStep 17:  Therefore, the values of $p$ and $q$ are $p=2$ and $q=7$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2,7}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of a geometric sequence and how logarithms work.\nStep 2:  A geometric sequence is a sequence in which each term after the first is obtained from the previous term by multiplying it by a constant. In this case, we're given three consecutive terms of a geometric sequence: $\\log _{2} x,\\left(1+\\log _{4} x\\right)$, and $\\log _{8} 4 x$.\nStep 3:  We know that the common ratio between consecutive terms in a geometric sequence is constant. So, we can set up the equation $\\frac{\\log _{4} x}{\\log _{2} x} = \\frac{\\log _{8} 4 x}{\\log _{4} x}$ to find the value of $x$.\nStep 4:  To simplify this equation, we can use the properties of logarithms. We can express $\\log _{4} x$ in terms of $\\log _{2} x$ using the change-of-base formula, which states that $\\log _{a} b = \\frac{\\log _{c} b}{\\log _{c} a}$.\nStep 5:  Applying this formula, we get $\\log _{4} x = \\frac{\\log _{2} x}{\\log _{2} 4} = \\frac{\\log _{2} x}{2}$.\nStep 6:  Similarly, we can express $\\log _{8} 4 x$ in terms of $\\log _{2} x$ using the change-of-base formula, which gives us $\\log _{8} 4 x = \\frac{\\log _{2} 4 x}{\\log _{2} 8} = \\frac{\\log _{2} 4 x}{3}$.\nStep 7:  Substituting these expressions back into the equation, we get $\\frac{\\frac{\\log _{2} x}{2}}{\\log _{2} x} = \\frac{\\frac{\\log _{2} 4 x}{3}}{\\frac{\\log _{2} x}{2}}$.\nStep 8:  Simplifying this equation, we find that $\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{2}{3}$, which is not true. This means that the given terms are not consecutive terms of a geometric sequence.\nStep 9:  However, we can try to find a different relationship between the terms. We can express $\\log _{4} x$ in terms of $\\log _{2} x$ as $\\log _{4} x = \\frac{\\log _{2} x}{2}$.\nStep 10:  Then, we can express $\\log _{8} 4 x$ in terms of $\\log _{2} x$ as $\\log _{8} 4 x = \\frac{\\log _{2} 4 x}{3}$.\nStep 11:  Substituting these expressions back into the equation, we get $\\frac{\\log _{2} x}{2} + 1 = \\frac{\\log _{2} 4 x}{3}$.\nStep 12:  Simplifying this equation, we find that $\\frac{3 \\log _{2} x + 6}{6} = \\frac{2 \\log _{2} 4 x}{3}$.\nStep 13:  Further simplifying, we get $3 \\log _{2} x + 6 = 4 \\log _{2} 4 x$.\nStep 14:  Using the property of logarithms that $\\log _{a} b^{c} = c \\log _{a} b$, we can rewrite $4 x$ as $2^{2} x$, giving us $3 \\log _{2} x + 6 = 2 \\log _{2} 2^{2} x$.\nStep 15:  Simplifying further, we get $3 \\log _{2} x + 6 = 2 \\log

  "Step 1:  The given equation involves logarithmic functions, so the first step is to simplify the equation by using the properties of logarithms.\nStep 2:  We start by isolating the logarithmic terms on one side of the equation.

This probability is $\\frac{2}{6} \\cdot \\frac{4}{5} \\cdot \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{1}{5}$.\nStep 6:  We can continue this pattern to find the probability of Amir winning on his fourth, fifth, and

  "Step 1: The problem provides the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence as $t_{n}=555-7 n$. We are also given the formula for the sum of the first n terms of the sequence as $S_{n}=t_{1}+t_{2}+\\ldots+t_{n}$.\n\nStep 2: To find the smallest value of n for which $S_{n}<0$, we need to find the sum of the first n terms of the sequence and determine when it becomes negative.\n\nStep 3: We can start by finding the sum of the first n terms of the sequence using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: $S_{n}=\\frac{n}{2}(2a+(n-1)d)$, where a is the first term and d is the common difference.\n\nStep 4: In this case, the first term is $t_{1}=555-7(1)=548$ and the common difference is $d=-7$. We can substitute these values into the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.\n\nStep 5: Substituting the values of a and d into the formula, we get $S_{n}=\\frac{n}{2}(2(548)+(n-1)(-7))$.\n\nStep 6: Simplifying the expression, we get $S_{n}=\\frac{n}{2}(1096-7n+7)$.\n\nStep 7: Further simplifying, we get $S_{n}=\\frac{n}{2}(1103-7n)$.\n\nStep 8: We want to find the smallest value of n for which $S_{n}<0$.

  "Step 1:  To solve the given system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we'll use the elimination method to find the values of $x$ and $y$.\nStep 2:  First, we'll subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate the $x^2$ term. This gives us the equation $xy - 8x + 8 = 0$.\nStep 3:  Next, we'll solve for $y$ in terms of $x$ from the equation $xy - 8x + 8 = 0$. We can rearrange the terms to get $y = \\frac{8x - 8}{x}$.\nStep 4:  Now, we'll substitute the expression for $y$ into the second equation, $x^2 - 8x + y = 0$, to solve for $x$. Substituting $y = \\frac{8x - 8}{x}$ into the second equation gives us $x^2 - 8x + \\frac{8x - 8}{x} = 0$.\nStep 5:  Multiplying through by $x$ to clear the fraction, we get $x^3 - 8x^2 + 8x - 8 = 0$.\nStep 6:  We can factor the equation $x^3 - 8x^2 + 8x - 8 = 0$ to find the values of $x$ that satisfy the equation.\nStep 7:  Factoring the equation gives us $(x - 2)(x^2 - 6x + 4) = 0$.\nStep 8:  Setting each factor equal to zero, we get $x - 2 = 0$ and $x^2 - 6x + 4 = 0$.\nStep 9:  Solving for $x$ in the first equation gives us $x = 2$.\nStep 10:  For the second equation, $x^2 - 6x + 4 = 0$, we can use the quadratic formula to find the values of $x$. The quadratic formula is given by $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.\nStep 11:  Substituting the values $a = 1$, $b = -6$, and $c = 4$ into the quadratic formula, we get $x = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{(-6)^2 - 4(1)(4)}}{2(1)}$.\nStep 12:  Simplifying the expression under the square root, we get $x = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{36 - 16}}{2}$.\nStep 13:  This simplifies to $x = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{20}}{2}$.\nStep 14:  Therefore, the solutions for $x$ are $x = 2$ and $x = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{20}}{2}$.\nStep 15:  Now that we have the values of $x$, we can substitute them back into the expression for $y$ to find the corresponding values of $y$.\nStep 16:  For $x = 2$, substituting into the expression $y = \\frac{8x - 8}{x}$ gives us $y = \\frac{8(2) - 8}{2} = \\frac{16 - 8}{2} = \\frac{8}{2} = 4$.\nStep 17:  Therefore, one solution to the system of equations is $(x, y) = (2, 4)$.\nStep 18:  For $x = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{20}}{2}$, we can substitute into the expression $y = \\frac{8x - 8}{x}$ to find the corresponding values of $y$.\nStep 19:  Substituting $x = \\frac{6 + \\sqrt{20}}{2}$ into the expression for $y$ gives us $y = \\frac{8\\left(\\frac{6 + \\sqrt{20}}{2}\\right) - 8}{\\frac{6 + \\sqrt{20}}{2}}$.\nStep 20:  Simplifying the expression, we get $y = \\frac{4(6 + \\sqrt{20}) - 8}{6 + \\sqrt{20}} = \\frac{24 + 4\\sqrt{20} - 8}{6 + \\sqrt{20}} = \\frac{16 + 4\\sqrt{20}}{6 + \\sqrt{20}}$.\nStep 21:  Therefore, one solution to the system of equations is $(x, y) = \\left(\\frac{6 + \\sqrt{20}}{2}, \\frac{16 + 4\\sqrt{20}}{6 + \\sqrt{20}}\\right)$.\nStep 22:  Similarly, substituting $x = \\frac{6 - \\sqrt{20}}{2}$ into the expression for $y$ gives us $y = \\frac{8\\left(\\frac{6 - \\sqrt{20}}{2}\\right) - 8}{\\frac{6 - \\sqrt{20}}{2}}$.\nStep 23:  Simplifying the expression, we get $y = \\frac{4(6 - \\sqrt{20}) - 8}{6 - \\sqrt{20}} = \\frac{24 - 4\\sqrt{20} - 8}{6 - \\sqrt{20}} = \\frac{16 - 4\\sqrt{20}}{6 - \\sqrt{20}}$.\nStep 24:  Therefore, another solution to the system of equations is $(x, y) = \\left(\\frac{6 - \\sqrt{20}}{2}, \\frac{16 - 4\\sqrt{20}}{6 - \\sqrt{20}}\\right)$.\nStep 25:  Therefore, the solutions to the system of equations are $(x, y) = (2, 4)$, $\\left(\\frac{6 + \\sqrt{20}}{2}, \\frac{16 + 4\\sqrt{20}}{6 + \\sqrt{20}}\\right)$, and $\\left(\\frac{6 - \\sqrt{20}}{2}, \\frac{16 - 4\\sqrt{20}}{6 - \\sqrt{20}}\\right)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$",

Then the next three consecutive multiples of 4 are $y+4$, $y+8$, and $y+12$.\nStep 7:  We can now set up the equation $x + (x+3) + (x+6) + y + (y+4) + (y+8) + (y+12) = 84$ to represent the sum of the smallest and largest integers.\nStep 8:  Simplifying this equation, we get $3x + 4y + 27 = 84$, which further simplifies to $3x + 4y = 57$.\nStep 9:  We also know that the sum of the three consecutive multiples of 3 is $3a$, so we have the equation $3x + 3(x+3) + 3(x+6) = 3a$, which simplifies to $9x + 27 = 3a$.\nStep 10:  Similarly, the sum of the four consecutive multiples of 4 is $4(a+27)$, so we have the equation $4y + 4(y+4) + 4(y+8) + 4(y+12) = 4(a+27)$, which simplifies to $20y + 168 = 4a + 108$.\nStep 11:  We can now solve the system of equations formed by these two equations to find the value of $a$.\nStep 12:  First, we can solve the equation $3x + 4y = 57$ for $x$ in terms of $y$, which gives us $x = \\frac{57-4y}{3}$.\nStep 13:  Substituting this expression for $x$ into the equation $9x + 27 = 3a$, we get $9\\left(\\frac{57-4y}{3}\\right) + 27 = 3a$, which simplifies to $57-4y+27=3a$.\nStep 14:  We can then solve for $a$ in terms of $y$ by rearranging the equation to get $a = \\frac{84-4y}{3}$.\nStep 15:  Substituting this expression for $a$ into the equation $20y + 168 = 4a + 108$, we get $20y + 168 = 4\\left(\\frac{84-4y}{3}\\right) + 108$.\nStep 16:  Simplifying this equation, we get $20y + 168 = \\frac{336-16y}{3} + 108$, which further simplifies to $60y + 504 = 336 - 16y + 324$.\nStep 17:  Combining like terms, we get $76y = -84$, which gives us $y = -\\frac{84}{76} = -\\frac{21}{19}$.\nStep 18:  Now that we have the value of $y$, we can substitute it back into the expression for $a$ to find the value of $a$.\nStep 19:  Substituting $y = -\\frac{21}{19}$ into the expression $a = \\frac{84-4y}{3}$, we get $a = \\frac{84-4\\left(-\\frac{21}{19}\\right)}{3}$.\nStep 20:  Simplifying this expression, we get $a = \\frac{84+\\frac{84}{19}}{3} = \\frac{1596+84}{57} = \\frac{1680}{57}$.\nStep 21:  Therefore, the value of $a$ is $\\frac{1680}{57}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1680}{57}}",

This means we need to consider the cases where $b-c$ is a multiple of 4.\nStep 4:  To approach this, we can first find the total number of possible pairs of $(b,c)$, which is $26 \\times 26 = 676$.\nStep 5:  Next, we need to identify the pairs where $b-c$ is a multiple of 4. This can be achieved by considering the possible remainders when $b$ and $c$ are divided by 4.\nStep 6:  We can then count the number of pairs where $b-c$ is a multiple of 4 by considering the different cases based on the remainders of $b$ and $c$ when divided by 4.\nStep 7:  By counting the pairs in each case, we can determine the total number of pairs where $b-c$ is a multiple of 4.\nStep 8:  Finally, we can calculate the probability by dividing the number of successful pairs by the total number of possible pairs.\nStep 9:  This will give us the probability that $b$ and $c$ differ by a multiple of 4.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{169}{676}}$",

This gives us an expression for $y$ in terms of $x$.\nStep 3:  Similarly, the second equation $y+\\log _{10}(y-1)=z-1$ can be rewritten as $y+\\log _{10}(y-1)-1=z$, providing an expression for $z$ in terms of $y$.\nStep 4:  Substituting the expression for $y$ from the first equation into the second equation, we get $x+\\log _{10} x-1+\\log _{10}(x+\\log _{10} x-1)-1=z$. This allows us to express $z$ in terms of $x$.\nStep 5:  Substituting the expression for $z$ from the second equation into the third equation, we get $y+\\log _{10}(y-1)-1+\\log _{10}(y+\\log _{10}(y-1)-1)-1=x+2$. This gives us an equation involving only $y$.\nStep 6:  We can then substitute the expression for $y$ from the first equation into this equation to obtain an equation involving only $x$.\nStep 7:  By analyzing the resulting equation, we can determine the possible values of $x$ and subsequently find the corresponding values of $y$ and $z$.\nStep 8:  We need to consider the domain of the logarithmic functions and ensure that the solutions obtained are valid.\nStep 9:  After finding the solutions, we must prove that there are no more solutions by showing that the equation obtained from the substitution process has no other solutions.\nStep 10:  This involves analyzing the equation and demonstrating that it has a unique solution, thereby confirming that the obtained solutions are the only possible solutions to the system of equations.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

The common divisors of two numbers are the numbers that divide both of them without leaving a remainder.\nStep 3:  We are given that the positive integers 34 and 80 have exactly two positive common divisors, namely 1 and 2.

This condition states that $f(n)=f(n-1)+1$ for odd positive integers $n>1$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, we can express $f(25)$ as $f(24)+1$.\nStep 9:  Now, we need to find the value of $f(24)$. Since $24$ is an even positive integer, we can use the second condition, which states that $f(n)=f\\left(\\frac{1}{2} n\\right)$ for even positive integers $n$.\nStep 10:  This means that $f(24)=f(12)$.\nStep 11:  Continuing this process, we find that $f(12)=f(6)$, $f(6)=f(3)$, and $f(3)=f(2)+1$.\nStep 12:  Since $2$ is an even positive integer, we can use the second condition again to find that $f(2)=f(1)$.\nStep 13:  Given that $f(1)=1$, we can now find the value of $f(3)$, which is $f(2)+1=1+1=2$.\nStep 14:  Therefore, $f(6)=f(3)=2$, $f(12)=f(6)=2$, and $f(24)=f(12)=2$.\nStep 15:  Finally, we can find the value of $f(25)$, which is $f(24)+1=2+1=3$.\nStep 16:  Hence, the value of $f(50)$ is $\\boxed{3}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$",

  "Problem: Determine the coordinates of the points of intersection of the graphs of $y=\\log _{10}(x-2)$ and $y=1-\\log _{10}(x+1)$. Step 1: To find the points of intersection, we need to set the two equations equal to each other and solve for x. This is because at the points of intersection, the y-values of the two graphs will be the same. Step 2: Set the two equations equal to each other: $\\log _{10}(x-2)=1-\\log _{10}(x+1)$. Step 3: Use the properties of logarithms to simplify the equation. We can rewrite $1-\\log _{10}(x+1)$ as $\\log _{10}\\left(\\frac{10}{x+1}\\right)$. So the equation becomes $\\log _{10}(x-2)=\\log _{10}\\left(\\frac{10}{x+1}\\right)$. Step 4: Since the bases of the logarithms are the same, we can equate the expressions inside the logarithms: $x-2=\\frac{10}{x+1}$. Step 5: Multiply both sides of the equation by $(x+1)$ to eliminate the fraction: $(x-2)(x+1)=10$. Step 6: Expand the left side of the equation: $x^{2}-x-2=10$. Step 7: Add $x$ and $2$ to both sides of the equation to get $x^{2}=12$. Step 8: Take the square root of both sides of the equation to solve for x: $x=\\pm \\sqrt{12}$. Step 9: Simplify the square root: $x=\\pm 2 \\sqrt{3}$. Step 10: Now that we have the x-coordinates of the points of intersection, we can substitute them into either of the original equations to find the corresponding y-coordinates. Let's use the first equation: $y=\\log _{10}(x-2)$. Step 11: Substitute $x=2 \\sqrt{3}$ into the equation: $y=\\log _{10}\\left(2 \\sqrt{3}-2\\right)$. Step 12: Simplify the expression inside the logarithm: $y=\\log _{10}\\left(2(\\sqrt{3}-1)\\right)$. Step 13: Use the properties of logarithms to simplify the expression: $y=\\log _{10} 2+\\log _{10}\\left(\\sqrt{3}-1\\right)$. Step 14: Use a calculator to find the values of the logarithms: $y \\approx 0.3010+0.1461 \\approx 0.4471$. Step 15: Now that we have the y-coordinate, we can write the coordinates of the point of intersection: $\\left(2 \\sqrt{3}, 0.4471\\right)$. Step 16: Repeat the process for the other x-coordinate: $x=-2 \\sqrt{3}$. Step 17: Substitute $x=-2 \\sqrt{3}$ into the equation: $y=\\log _{10}\\left(-2 \\sqrt{3}-2\\right)$.

This can be expressed as $2(x \\pmod{100})$.\nStep 4:  Since Charlie was born in the twentieth century, the year in which he was born is between 1900 and 1999. Therefore, we can express his current age as $2014 - x$.\nStep 5:  Equating these two expressions for Charlie's age, we get the equation $2014 - x = 2(x \\pmod{100})$.\nStep 6:  We can simplify this equation by considering the possible values of $x \\pmod{100}$, which range from 0 to 99.\nStep 7:  By analyzing the equation, we find that the only possible value for $x \\pmod{100}$ is 14, which leads to the solution $x = 1914$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the four-digit year in which Charlie was born is $\\boxed{1914}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1914}$",

This means that the order of these pairs must be maintained in the lineup.\nStep 3:  We can start by considering the possible positions for each person in the lineup. Since there are 6 people, there are 6! ways to arrange them without any restrictions.\nStep 4:  However, we need to account for the restrictions imposed by the given conditions. We can do this by considering the number of ways to arrange the pairs within the restrictions.\nStep 5:  The first pair, Greg and Peter, can be arranged in 2 ways (Greg-Peter or Peter-Greg), but since Greg must be ahead of Peter, there is only 1 acceptable arrangement for this pair.\nStep 6:  Similarly, the second pair, Peter and Bobby, can also be arranged in 2 ways, but again, only 1 arrangement is acceptable (Peter-Bobby).\nStep 7:  The third pair, Marcia and Jan, can be arranged in 2 ways, but only 1 arrangement is acceptable (Marcia-Jan).\nStep 8:  The fourth pair, Jan and Cindy, can also be arranged in 2 ways, but only 1 arrangement is acceptable (Jan-Cindy).\nStep 9:  Now, we need to consider the number of ways to arrange the remaining person, Marcia, in the lineup.

The sequence starts with $X$ and $O$, and then each subsequent term is formed by appending the reverse of the previous term to the previous term.

We are told that the area of this region is $T=20 \\sqrt{7}$.\nStep 3:  To approach this problem, we need to understand the behavior of the function $y=\\lceil x\\rceil^{2}$ and how it affects the area of the region.\nStep 4:  We are given that for $0\\le x<1$, the graph of $y=\\lceil x\\rceil^{2}$ is a horizontal line at $y=1$. For $1\\le x<2$, the graph of $y=\\lceil x\\rceil^{2}$ is a horizontal line at $y=4$. This pattern continues, with the graph of $y=\\lceil x\\rceil^{2}$ being a horizontal line at $y=n^2$ for $n-1\\le x<n$.\nStep 5:  We can use this information to calculate the area of the region by summing the areas of the rectangles formed by the graph of $y=\\lceil x\\rceil^{2}$ and the lines $x=0$ and $x=w$.\nStep 6:  The area of each rectangle is given by the product of its length and width, which is $n^2$ and $1$, respectively. The total area is then given by the sum of these areas, which is $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\lceil w\\rceil} n^2$.\nStep 7:  We are given that this total area is equal to $20 \\sqrt{7}$, so we can set up the equation $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\lceil w\\rceil} n^2 = 20 \\sqrt{7}$.\nStep 8:  We can use the formula for the sum of squares of the first $n$ natural numbers, which is $\\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$, to simplify the equation.\nStep 9:  By substituting the value of the sum of squares into the equation, we can solve for $\\lceil w\\rceil$.\nStep 10:  Once we have the value of $\\lceil w\\rceil$, we can find the value of $\\lceil 2w\\rceil$ by multiplying $\\lceil w\\rceil$ by $2$ and taking the ceiling of the result.\nStep 11:  Therefore, we need to solve the equation $\\frac{\\lceil w\\rceil(\\lceil w\\rceil+1)(2\\lceil w\\rceil+1)}{6} = 20 \\sqrt{7}$ to find the value of $\\lceil w\\rceil$.\nStep 12:  After solving for $\\lceil w\\rceil$, we can find the value of $\\lceil 2w\\rceil$ by multiplying $\\lceil w\\rceil$ by $2$ and taking the ceiling of the result.\nStep 13:  This will give us the final answer to the problem.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{41}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first understand the given information and what is being asked. We are told that $T=8$ and that a total of $20T$ handshakes take place at the party.\nStep 2:  We know that each person shakes hands with everyone else exactly once, except for Ed, who leaves early. This means that the total number of handshakes is the sum of the handshakes each person has with the others, minus the handshakes Ed has with the others.\nStep 3:  Let's denote the number of people at the party as $n$. Then, the total number of handshakes can be expressed as $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$, as each person shakes hands with $n-1$ others, and we divide by $2$ to avoid counting each handshake twice.\nStep 4:  We are given that the total number of handshakes is $20T$, which is equal to $160$. So, we have the equation $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} = 160$.\nStep 5:  Solving for $n$, we get $n^2 - n - 320 = 0$. We can factor this quadratic equation to get $(n-16)(n+20) = 0$.\nStep 6:  Since the number of people cannot be negative, we take the positive root, which gives us $n=16$.\nStep 7:  Now, we need to find the number of people who shook hands with Ed. This can be calculated as $16-1=15$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the number of people at the party who shook hands with Ed is $\\boxed{15}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{15}$",

We need to find the relationship between the number of residents $n$ and the number of dishes $d$.\nStep 4:  To approach this, we can consider the number of pairs of dishes that can be made by the residents. Since each resident knows how to make exactly two dishes, the number of pairs of dishes is given by the combination formula $\\binom{n}{2}$, where $n$ is the number of residents.\nStep 5:  However, we also know that each pair of dishes is associated with exactly one resident who knows how to make those two dishes. This means that the number of pairs of dishes is equal to the number of residents, which is $n$.\nStep 6:  Therefore, we have the equation $\\binom{n}{2} = n$.

Therefore, the only valid solution is $n=3$.\nStep 14:  Now, we need to find the value of $d$ in terms of $n$.

  "To solve this problem, we need to understand the structure of a full town $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$ and how resident cycles are formed within it. A full town is one where every pair of dishes is known by exactly one resident. This means that for any two dishes, there is a unique resident who knows how to make both of them.\n\nLet's consider the number of ways to choose a resident cycle of length $k$ in $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$. We can start by choosing the first resident in the cycle. Since there are $d$ dishes in total, there are $d$ choices for the first resident, as they can know any of the $d$ dishes.\n\nOnce the first resident is chosen, we need to choose the second resident. This resident must know a dish that is common to the first resident and another resident. Since there are $d-1$ remaining dishes, there are $d-1$ choices for the second resident.\n\nHowever, we need to be careful not to count the same resident cycle multiple times. If we choose the same resident for the second position, we will end up with the same cycle. Therefore, we need to divide by the number of ways to choose the second resident, which is $d-1$.\n\nWe can continue this process, choosing the third resident, and so on, until we have chosen $k$ residents. At each step, we need to choose a resident who knows a dish that is common to the previous resident and another resident.\n\nThe number of ways to choose the $i$th resident is $d-i+1$, as there are $d-i+1$ remaining dishes that are common to the previous resident and another resident.\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinguishable resident cycles of length $k$ in $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$ is given by the product of the number of choices at each step:\n\n$$\\frac{d(d-1)(d-2) \\cdots (d-k+1)}{(d-k+1)!}$$\n\nThis expression counts the number of ways to choose a resident cycle of length $k$ in $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$, taking into account the fact that the same cycle may be counted multiple times.\n\nTo simplify this expression, we can cancel out the common factors in the numerator and denominator:\n\n$$\\frac{d(d-1)(d-2) \\cdots (d-k+1)}{(d-k+1)!} = \\frac{d!}{(d-k)!}$$\n\nThis is the final answer.\n\n\\boxed{\\frac{d!}{(d-k)!}}",

This means that the square has a side length of $1$ unit.\nStep 3:  We are looking for the shortest path that touches three of the four sides of the square. This path will be a straight line, and we can find it by considering the reflections of the point $(2/7, 3/7)$ across the sides of the square.\nStep 4:  Let's denote the point $(2/7, 3/7)$ as $P$.

Using the formula for the area of a regular hexagon, we get $[A B C D E F] = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\cdot 24^2$.\nStep 8:  Since the area of the overlapping region $[G B C D K L]$ is half the area of the entire hexagon, we have $[G B C D K L] = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot [A B C D E F] = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\cdot 24^2$.\nStep 9:  We can simplify this expression to find the area of the overlapping region.\n\nStep 10:  Next, we need to find the length of $L F$. To do this, we can use the fact that the area of a triangle is given by $A = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot b \\cdot h$. We can consider the triangle formed by $L F$ and the base $B K$.\nStep 11:  The height of this triangle is the distance from $L$ to the line $B K$, which is equal to the side length of the hexagon, $24$.\nStep 12:  We can use the formula for the area of a triangle to find the length of $L F$.\n\nStep 13:  By carefully analyzing the given information and using these geometric properties, we can find the length of $L F$.\n\nStep 14:  Now, let's calculate the area of the entire hexagon $[A B C D E F]$ using the formula for the area of a regular hexagon: $[A B C D E F] = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\cdot 24^2 = 1296\\sqrt{3}$.\nStep 15:  Since the area of the overlapping region $[G B C D K L]$ is half the area of the entire hexagon, we have $[G B C D K L] = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot [A B C D E F] = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1296\\sqrt{3} = 648\\sqrt{3}$.\nStep 16:  Now, let's consider the triangle formed by $L F$ and the base $B K$. The height of this triangle is the distance from $L$ to the line $B K$, which is equal to the side length of the hexagon, $24$.\nStep 17:  We can use the formula for the area of a triangle to find the length of $L F$: $[L F B K] = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot B K \\cdot L F$. Since $B K = 24$, we have $[L F B K] = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 24 \\cdot L F$.\nStep 18:  We also know that the area of the overlapping region $[G B C D K L]$ is equal to the area of the triangle $[L F B K]$, so we can set up the equation: $648\\sqrt{3} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 24 \\cdot L F$.\nStep 19:  Solving for $L F$, we get $L F = \\frac{648\\sqrt{3}}{12} = 54\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{54\\sqrt{3}}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first understand the relationship between the number of digits in the decimal expansion of a number and its logarithm.\nStep 2:  We are given two numbers, $100^{1000^{10,000}}$ and $1000^{10,000^{100,000}}$, and we need to find the number of digits in their decimal expansions, denoted by $X$ and $Y$ respectively.\nStep 3:  The number of digits in the decimal expansion of a number $n$ can be found using the formula $\\lfloor\\log_{10} n\\rfloor + 1$, where $\\lfloor x\\rfloor$ represents the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$.\nStep 4:  We can start by finding the number of digits in the decimal expansion of $100^{1000^{10,000}}$. This can be expressed as $\\lfloor\\log_{10} 100^{1000^{10,000}}\\rfloor + 1 = \\lfloor 1000^{10,000} \\log_{10} 100\\rfloor + 1$.\nStep 5:  Similarly, for $1000^{10,000^{100,000}}$, the number of digits in its decimal expansion is given by $\\lfloor\\log_{10} 1000^{10,000^{100,000}}\\rfloor + 1 = \\lfloor 10,000^{100,000} \\log_{10} 1000\\rfloor + 1$.\nStep 6:  We can simplify these expressions further by using the properties of logarithms.

This implies that the constant term $c$ in the quadratic function is $0$.\nStep 3:  Therefore, the quadratic function can be expressed as $f(x) = ax^2 + bx$.\nStep 4:  We also know that the graph of the function passes through the point $(15,225)$. Substituting these values into the function, we get $f(15) = 225$.\nStep 5:  Substituting $x=15$ and $f(15)=225$ into the function $f(x) = ax^2 + bx$, we get $225 = 225a + 15b$.\nStep 6:  This equation can be simplified to $15b = -15a$, which further simplifies to $b = -a$.\nStep 7:  Now, we need to find the integer roots of the quadratic function.

Since $c=0$, the product of the roots is $0$.\nStep 9:  This implies that one of the roots must be $0$, and the other root can be any integer value.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the possible pairs of roots are $(0, r)$, where $r$ can be any integer.\nStep 11:  Since $b = -a$, we can express the quadratic function as $f(x) = ax^2 - ax = a(x^2 - x)$.\nStep 12:  The roots of the quadratic function are the values of $x$ that satisfy the equation $x^2 - x = 0$.\nStep 13:  Factoring the quadratic expression, we get $x(x-1) = 0$.\nStep 14:  Therefore, the roots of the quadratic function are $x=0$ and $x=1$.\nStep 15:  Since the roots are $0$ and $1$, the quadratic function can be expressed as $f(x) = a(x^2 - x)$.\nStep 16:  We need to find the integer values of $a$ that satisfy the condition $f(15) = 225$.\nStep 17:  Substituting $x=15$ into the function, we get $f(15) = a(15^2 - 15) = 225$.\nStep 18:  Simplifying the equation, we get $a(210) = 225$.\nStep 19:  Solving for $a$, we find that $a = 225/210 = 15/14$.\nStep 20:  However, we are looking for integer values of $a$, so we need to find the integer values of $a$ that satisfy the condition $f(15) = 225$.\nStep 21:  Since $a$ must be an integer, we can try different integer values of $a$ to see if they satisfy the condition.\nStep 22:  We can start by trying $a=1$ and see if it satisfies the condition.\nStep 23:  Substituting $a=1$ into the function, we get $f(15) = 1(15^2 - 15) = 210$.\nStep 24:  Since $f(15) = 210 \\neq 225$, $a=1$ does not satisfy the condition.\nStep 25:  We can try other integer values of $a$ to see if they satisfy the condition.\nStep 26:  After trying different integer values of $a$, we find that $a=15$ satisfies the condition.\nStep 27:  Substituting $a=15$ into the function, we get $f(15) = 15(15^2 - 15) = 225$.\nStep 28:  Therefore, the quadratic function $f(x) = 15(x^2 - x)$ satisfies the condition $f(15) = 225$.\nStep 29:  Since $a=15$ is the only integer value that satisfies the condition, there is only one possible quadratic function that satisfies the given conditions.\nStep 30:  Therefore, the number of quadratic functions $f(x)=ax^2+bx+c$ with integer roots and integer coefficients whose graphs pass through the points $(0,0)$ and $(15,225)$ is $\\boxed{1}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given information and use geometric properties to find the area of the trapezoid $PQWZ$.\nStep 2:  First, we are given that points $P$ and $Q$ trisect $\\overline{AR}$, which means they divide it into three equal parts. Similarly, points $W, X, Y, Z$ divide $\\overline{ML}$ into fifths, with $W$ closest to $M$ and $X$ and $Y$ between $W$ and $Z$.\nStep 3:  We are also told that $[ARM L] = T$, where $T$ is a unit of area. Our goal is to find the area of trapezoid $PQWZ$, denoted as $[PQWZ]$.\nStep 4:  To approach this, we can use the fact that the area of a trapezoid is the average of the lengths of its bases multiplied by its height. In this case, the bases of the trapezoid $PQWZ$ are $PQ$ and $WZ$, and its height is the distance between the parallel sides $PQ$ and $WZ$.\nStep 5:  We can start by finding the lengths of $PQ$ and $WZ$ using the given information about the trisection and division of the line segments.\nStep 6:  Since $P$ and $Q$ trisect $\\overline{AR}$, we know that $AP = PQ = QR = \\frac{1}{3}AR$. Similarly, since $W, X, Y, Z$ divide $\\overline{ML}$ into fifths, we have $MW = \\frac{1}{5}ML$ and $WZ = \\frac{2}{5}ML$.\nStep 7:  Now, we can use the fact that the area of a trapezoid is the average of the lengths of its bases multiplied by its height. In this case, the height of the trapezoid $PQWZ$ is the distance between the parallel sides $PQ$ and $WZ$, which is equal to the distance between the parallel sides $AR$ and $ML$.\nStep 8:  We can then use the fact that the area of a parallelogram is equal to its base times its height to find the area of the parallelogram $ARM L$.\nStep 9:  Finally, we can use the fact that the area of a trapezoid is the average of the lengths of its bases multiplied by its height to find the area of the trapezoid $PQWZ$.\nStep 10:  By carefully following these steps and using the given information, we can find the area of the trapezoid $PQWZ$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{15}T}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first understand what is being asked. We are given the expression $(T+10)!$, where $T$ is defined as $T = T N Y W R$. We are asked to find the number of positive perfect cubes that are divisors of $(T+10)!$.\nStep 2:  The first step is to understand the value of $T$. Since $T = T N Y W R$, we can calculate the value of $T$ by multiplying the individual digits: $T = 2 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 = 1440$.\nStep 3:  Next, we need to find the prime factorization of $T+10$, which is $1450$. The prime factorization of $1450$ is $2 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 29$.\nStep 4:  Now, we need to find the prime factorization of $(T+10)!$. We know that the prime factorization of $n!$ is the product of the prime factorizations of all the numbers from $1$ to $n$.\nStep 5:  To find the number of positive perfect cubes that are divisors of $(T+10)!$, we need to find the number of perfect cubes that are divisors of $1450!$.\nStep 6:  We can use the formula for the number of perfect cubes that are divisors of $n!$, which is given by $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{3} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{9} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{27} \\right\\rfloor + \\cdots$.\nStep 7:  Applying this formula to $1450$, we get $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{1450}{3} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{1450}{9} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{1450}{27} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{1450}{81} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{1450}{243} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{1450}{729} \\right\\rfloor$.\nStep 8:  Evaluating each of these terms, we get $483 + 161 + 54 + 18 + 6 + 2$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the number of positive perfect cubes that are divisors of $(T+10)!$ is $483 + 161 + 54 + 18 + 6 + 2 = \\boxed{724}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{724}$",

We know that the graph intersects the $x$-axis at these points, so their $y$-coordinates are both $0$. We can use the equation of the graph to find the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $M$.\nStep 4:  The equation of the graph is $y=x^{2}+2 x-T$. Setting $y=0$, we get $x^{2}+2 x-T=0$. This is a quadratic equation in $x$, and we can solve for $x$ using the quadratic formula.\nStep 5:  The quadratic formula states that for an equation of the form $ax^{2}+bx+c=0$, the solutions for $x$ are given by $x=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}$. In this case, $a=1$, $b=2$, and $c=-T$.\nStep 6:  Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get $x=\\frac{-2\\pm\\sqrt{2^{2}-4(1)(-T)}}{2(1)}=\\frac{-2\\pm\\sqrt{4+4T}}{2}=-1\\pm\\sqrt{1+T}$.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $M$ are $-1+\\sqrt{1+T}$ and $-1-\\sqrt{1+T}$, respectively.\nStep 8:  Since $A$ and $M$ are diagonally opposite vertices of a square, the length of the side of the square is the difference between their $x$-coordinates, which is $2\\sqrt{1+T}$.\nStep 9:  The area of a square is given by the formula $[A R M L]=(\\text{side length})^{2}$. Substituting the side length we found, we get $[A R M L]=(2\\sqrt{1+T})^{2}=4(1+T)=4+4T$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the area of the square $A R M L$ is $4+4T$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4+4T}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the recursive definition of the sequence $a_n$ and then compute the sum of the squares of the first $T-3$ terms of the sequence.\nStep 2:  We are given that the first two terms of the sequence are $a_{1}=3 / 5$ and $a_{2}=4 / 5$. For $n>2$, if $n$ is odd, then $a_{n}=a_{n-1}^{2}-a_{n-2}^{2}$, while if $n$ is even, then $a_{n}=2 a_{n-2} a_{n-3}$.\nStep 3:  We are asked to compute the sum of the squares of the first $T-3$ terms of the sequence, where $T$ is defined as $T=T N Y W R$.\nStep 4:  To start, we need to calculate the first few terms of the sequence using the given recursive definition.\nStep 5:  We find that $a_3 = a_2^2 - a_1^2 = \\frac{16}{25} - \\frac{9}{25} = \\frac{7}{25}$, and $a_4 = 2a_2a_1 = \\frac{24}{25}$.\nStep 6:  Next, we calculate $a_5$ and $a_6$ using the recursive definition, and we find that $a_5 = \\frac{7}{25}$ and $a_6 = \\frac{48}{125}$.\nStep 7:  We then notice that the sequence becomes periodic from this point, with a period of length 4, and the terms repeat in the order $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4$.\nStep 8:  We can use this periodicity to simplify the calculation of the sum of the squares of the first $T-3$ terms of the sequence.\nStep 9:  Since the period has a length of 4, we can express $T-3$ as $4k$ for some integer $k$.\nStep 10:  This allows us to rewrite the sum of the squares of the first $T-3$ terms as the sum of the squares of the first $4k$ terms of the sequence.\nStep 11:  We can then use the periodicity of the sequence to simplify this sum into a more manageable form.\nStep 12:  After simplifying the sum, we find that it equals $\\frac{1}{5}$.\nStep 13:  Therefore, the sum of the squares of the first $T-3$ terms of the sequence is $\\frac{1}{5}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{5}}",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given information and what is being asked. We are given an arithmetic sequence $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, \\ldots$, and we know that $a_{16}=13$ and $a_{30}=20$. We are asked to find the value of $k$ for which $a_{k}=T$, where $T$ is defined as $T=T N Y W R$.\nStep 2:  The first step is to find the common difference of the arithmetic sequence. We can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence, which is $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$, where $a_n$ is the nth term, $a_1$ is the first term, $n$ is the term number, and $d$ is the common difference.\nStep 3:  We are given that $a_{16}=13$ and $a_{30}=20$. Using the formula, we can write the equations $13 = a_1 + 15d$ and $20 = a_1 + 29d$.\nStep 4:  Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get $7 = 14d$, which gives us the common difference $d = \\frac{7}{14} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nStep 5:  Now that we have the common difference, we can find the value of $a_1$ by substituting $d$ into one of the original equations. Let's use the equation $13 = a_1 + 15d$. Substituting $d = \\frac{1}{2}$, we get $13 = a_1 + 15 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}$, which simplifies to $13 = a_1 + \\frac{15}{2}$.

Since the palindrome must read the same forwards and backwards, the first and last letters must be the same, the second and second-to-last letters must be the same, and so on.\nStep 6:  This means that we have 5 pairs of letters to arrange, and for each pair, there are 2 choices (either the first or the second letter of the pair).

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to start by understanding the given information and what is being asked. We are given a square $A B C D$ with an area of $T=36$. Points $M, N, O$, and $P$ lie on the sides of the square, forming a rectangle $M N O P$.\nStep 2:  The first step is to find the side length of the square $A B C D$. Since the area of the square is $T=36$, we can find the side length by taking the square root of the area, which gives us $s = \\sqrt{T} = \\sqrt{36} = 6$.\nStep 3:  Next, we need to find the length of $M P$, which is given as $2$. Since $M P$ is a diagonal of the rectangle $M N O P$, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of $M N$. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\nStep 4:  In this case, we have a right-angled triangle with $M P$ as the hypotenuse and $M N$ and $P O$ as the other two sides. We know that $M P=2$ and $P O=s/2=3$. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find $M N$ as follows: $M N = \\sqrt{M P^2 - P O^2} = \\sqrt{2^2 - 3^2} = \\sqrt{4 - 9} = \\sqrt{-5}$.\nStep 5:  However, we made an error in our calculation. The correct calculation should be $M N = \\sqrt{M P^2 - P O^2} = \\sqrt{2^2 - 3^2} = \\sqrt{4 - 9} = \\sqrt{-5}$, which is not a real number. This indicates that our previous steps were incorrect.\nStep 6:  Let's re-evaluate the problem. We know that the area of the square is $T=36$, so the side length of the square is $s = \\sqrt{T} = \\sqrt{36} = 6$. We also know that $M P=2$ and $P O=s/2=3$. Since $M P$ is a diagonal of the rectangle $M N O P$, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of $M N$. However, we need to find the correct relationship between $M N$ and the other sides of the rectangle.\nStep 7:  Let's consider the relationship between the sides of the rectangle. Since $M P$ is a diagonal, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of $M N$. However, we need to find the correct relationship between $M N$ and the other sides of the rectangle.\nStep 8:  We can see that $M N$ is the difference between the side length of the square and the length of $P O$. Therefore, $M N = s - P O = 6 - 3 = 3$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that Aditya and Ayesha choose the same set of four letters from the alphabet.\nStep 2:  First, let's determine the total number of ways Aditya can choose 2 letters from the first half of the alphabet (A-M) and 2 letters from the second half (N-Z). This can be calculated using combinations, denoted as $\\binom{n}{r}$, which represents the number of ways to choose r items from a set of n items without considering the order.\nStep 3:  For Aditya, the number of ways to choose 2 letters from the first half of the alphabet is $\\binom{13}{2}$, and the number of ways to choose 2 letters from the second half is also $\\binom{13}{2}$. Therefore, the total number of ways for Aditya to choose 2 letters from each half is $\\binom{13}{2} \\times \\binom{13}{2}$.\nStep 4:  Similarly, for Ayesha, the number of ways to choose 2 letters from the first half of the alphabet is also $\\binom{13}{2}$, and the number of ways to choose 2 letters from the second half is also $\\binom{13}{2}$. Therefore, the total number of ways for Ayesha to choose 2 letters from each half is $\\binom{13}{2} \\times \\binom{13}{2}$.\nStep 5:  Now, we need to find the number of ways Aditya and Ayesha can choose the same set of four letters. This can be calculated by finding the number of ways to choose 4 letters from the entire alphabet, which is $\\binom{26}{4}$.\nStep 6:  The probability that Aditya and Ayesha choose the same set of four letters is then given by the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes (choosing the same set of four letters) to the total number of possible outcomes (choosing any set of four letters).\nStep 7:  Therefore, the probability is $\\frac{\\binom{26}{4}}{\\left( \\binom{13}{2} \\right)^2}$.\nStep 8:  Calculating this, we get $\\frac{12650}{4225} = \\frac{2530}{845}$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the probability that Aditya and Ayesha choose the same set of four letters is $\\frac{2530}{845}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{2530}{845}}$",

This means that the element should not share any prime factors with any other number in the sequence.\nStep 3:  We are given that $n=6$, so we have a sequence of 6 consecutive positive integers.\nStep 4:  To maximize the number of cromulent elements, we need to find a sequence where the numbers are as far apart as possible, so that they don't share any common factors.\nStep 5:  The sequence with the maximum number of cromulent elements will be the one where the numbers are consecutive and the first number is 1, as 1 is relatively prime to all other numbers.\nStep 6:  Therefore, the sequence with the maximum number of cromulent elements is $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$.\nStep 7:  Now, let's find the minimum possible number of cromulent elements.

  "To find the maximum and minimum possible number of cromulent elements in a sequence of $n$ consecutive positive integers with $n=7$, we need to consider the properties of consecutive integers and the concept of being relatively prime.\n\nFirst, let's understand what it means for two numbers to be relatively prime. Two numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1. In other words, they have no common factors other than 1.\n\nNow, let's consider a sequence of $n$ consecutive positive integers. We can represent this sequence as $x, x+1, x+2, \\ldots, x+n-1$, where $x$ is the first integer in the sequence.\n\nFor an element $a$ in the sequence to be cromulent, it must be relatively prime to all other elements in the sequence. This means that $a$ cannot share any common factors with any other element in the sequence.\n\nLet's consider the possible values of $x$ and how they affect the number of cromulent elements in the sequence.\n\nIf $x$ is a prime number, then all elements in the sequence will be relatively prime to each other, since a prime number has no common factors with any other number except for 1. In this case, all $n$ elements in the sequence will be cromulent.\n\nIf $x$ is a composite number, then some elements in the sequence will share common factors with $x$. For example, if $x$ is a multiple of a prime number $p$, then all elements in the sequence that are also multiples of $p$ will share a common factor with $x$.\n\nTo find the maximum possible number of cromulent elements, we need to choose $x$ such that it is a prime number. In this case, all $n$ elements in the sequence will be cromulent.\n\nTo find the minimum possible number of cromulent elements, we need to choose $x$ such that it is a composite number that has the largest number of common factors with other elements in the sequence. In this case, we can choose $x$ to be a multiple of a prime number $p$ that is also a factor of many other elements in the sequence.\n\nFor example, if $x$ is a multiple of 2, then all even numbers in the sequence will share a common factor with $x$. Similarly, if $x$ is a multiple of 3, then all multiples of 3 in the sequence will share a common factor with $x$.\n\nBy choosing $x$ to be a composite number with the largest number of common factors with other elements in the sequence, we can minimize the number of cromulent elements.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible number of cromulent elements in a sequence of $n$ consecutive positive integers with $n=7$ is $n=7$, and the minimum possible number of cromulent elements is $n-1=6$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$",

For the roots of this polynomial to be integers, the discriminant, which is the expression under the square root in the quadratic formula, must be a perfect square.\n## Step 3:  The discriminant of the polynomial is given by the expression $(u+v)^2-4(uv+4)$.\n## Step 4:  We can simplify this expression to get $u^2+2uv+v^2-4uv-16$, which further simplifies to $u^2-2uv+v^2-16$.\n## Step 5:  We can rewrite this expression as $(u-v)^2-16$. For the roots of the polynomial to be integers, $(u-v)^2-16$ must be a perfect square.\n## Step 6:  This means that $(u-v)^2$ must be a perfect square plus 16. We need to find all the perfect squares that are 16 more than another perfect square.\n## Step 7:  We can start by listing the perfect squares from 1 to 30 and then check which ones are 16 more than another perfect square.\n## Step 8:  The perfect squares from 1 to 30 are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, and 36. We can see that 36 is 16 more than 20, which is not a perfect square.\n## Step 9:  However, 25 is 16 more than 9, and 16 is 16 more than 0, which is also not a perfect square.\n## Step 10:  We can also see that 9 is 16 more than 1, and 4 is 16 more than 0, but 0 is not a perfect square.\n## Step 11:  Therefore, the only perfect squares that are 16 more than another perfect square are 25 and 9.\n## Step 12:  This means that the possible values for $(u-v)^2$ are 25 and 9.\n## Step 13:  Since $u$ and $v$ are distinct numbers chosen from the set $\\{1,2,3, \\ldots, 30\\}$, we need to find the number of pairs $(u,v)$ such that $(u-v)^2$ is equal to 25 or 9.\n## Step 14:  For $(u-v)^2=25$, we have $u-v=\\pm5$. This gives us 6 possible pairs: $(6,11)$, $(7,12)$, $(8,13)$, $(9,14)$, $(10,15)$, and $(11,16)$.\n## Step 15:  For $(u-v)^2=9$, we have $u-v=\\pm3$. This gives us 8 possible pairs: $(4,7)$, $(5,8)$, $(6,9)$, $(7,10)$, $(8,11)$, $(9,12)$, $(10,13)$, and $(11,14)$.\n## Step 16:  Therefore, the total number of pairs $(u,v)$ such that the roots of the polynomial are integers is 6+8=14.\n## Step 17:  Since there are 30 possible pairs $(u,v)$, the probability that the roots of the polynomial are integers is $\\frac{14}{30}=\\frac{7}{15}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{15}}",
  "Problem: The degree-measures of the interior angles of convex hexagon TIEBRK are all integers in arithmetic progression. Compute the least possible degree-measure of the smallest interior angle in hexagon TIEBRK.\nStep 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of a convex hexagon and the concept of arithmetic progression.\nStep 2:  A convex hexagon has six sides, and the sum of the interior angles of any polygon can be calculated using the formula $(n-2) \\times 180^\\circ$, where $n$ is the number of sides. For a hexagon, this sum is $(6-2) \\times 180^\\circ = 720^\\circ$.\nStep 3:  We are given that the degree-measures of the interior angles of the convex hexagon TIEBRK are all integers in arithmetic progression. This means that the angles can be represented as $x$, $x+d$, $x+2d$, $x+3d$, $x+4d$, and $x+5d$, where $x$ is the smallest angle and $d$ is the common difference between consecutive angles.\nStep 4:  The sum of these angles must equal $720^\\circ$, so we can write the equation $6x+15d=720$.\nStep 5:  We also know that the smallest angle, $x$, must be an integer, and we want to find the least possible value of $x$.\nStep 6:  To minimize $x$, we need to minimize $d$. Since $d$ is an integer, we can start by trying the smallest possible value for $d$, which is $1$.\nStep 7:  Substituting $d=1$ into the equation $6x+15d=720$, we get $6x+15=720$, which simplifies to $6x=705$. Solving for $x$, we find that $x=117.5$.\nStep 8:  However, $x$ must be an integer, so $d=1$ is not a valid solution. We need to try the next possible value for $d$, which is $2$.\nStep 9:  Substituting $d=2$ into the equation $6x+15d=720$, we get $6x+30=720$, which simplifies to $6x=690$. Solving for $x$, we find that $x=115$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the least possible degree-measure of the smallest interior angle in hexagon TIEBRK is $\\boxed{115}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{115}$",

The domain of the function is the set of all real numbers, which implies that the denominator $x^{2}+1$ is never equal to zero for any real value of $x$.\nStep 3:  To find the least integer value of the function, we need to analyze the behavior of the function as $x$ varies over the real numbers.\nStep 4:  We can start by factoring the numerator of the function, which is $x^{4}-6 x^{3}+2 x^{2}-6 x+2$. Factoring this expression will help us understand the behavior of the function better.\nStep 5:  After factoring the numerator, we get $(x-1)(x-2)(x^{2}-3 x+1)$. This gives us a clearer understanding of the function's behavior.\nStep 6:  Now, we can analyze the behavior of the function by considering the factors of the numerator and the denominator.\nStep 7:  We observe that the function has a vertical asymptote at $x=0$ due to the factor $x^{2}+1$ in the denominator.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given information and what is being asked. We are dealing with a right square pyramid, $L E O J S$, with base $E O J S$ and area $T=4$. The length of the diagonal $L E$ is given as $5 \\sqrt{2}$, and we are required to find the area of the triangular face $[L E O]$.\nStep 2:  The first step is to find the side length of the base $E O J S$. Since the area of the base is given as $T=4$, we can use the formula for the area of a square, which is side length squared. Therefore, the side length of the base is $\\sqrt{T} = \\sqrt{4} = 2$.\nStep 3:  Next, we need to find the length of the diagonal $E O$. Since the base is a square, the diagonal $E O$ is equal to the side length multiplied by $\\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, $E O = 2 \\cdot \\sqrt{2} = 2 \\sqrt{2}$.\nStep 4:  Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height of the pyramid. The height is the leg of a right triangle with hypotenuse $L E$ and base $E O$. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have $L E^2 = E O^2 + H^2$, where $H$ is the height of the pyramid. Substituting the given values, we get $5^2 \\cdot 2 = (2 \\sqrt{2})^2 + H^2$, which simplifies to $50 = 8 + H^2$. Solving for $H$, we find $H^2 = 42$, and taking the square root gives us $H = \\sqrt{42}$.\nStep 5:  Finally, we can find the area of the triangular face $[L E O]$ using the formula for the area of a triangle, which is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\text{base} \\cdot \\text{height}$.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the largest possible perimeter of the region enclosed by three non-overlapping squares with positive integer side lengths.\nStep 2:  We are given that the three squares have one vertex at the origin and sides parallel to the coordinate axes, and together they enclose a region whose area is 41.\nStep 3:  Let's denote the side lengths of the squares as $a$, $b$, and $c$. The area of the enclosed region is given by the sum of the areas of the three squares, which is $ab + bc + ca = 41$.\nStep 4:  We are asked to find the largest possible perimeter of the region, which is given by $2(a + b + c)$.\nStep 5:  To maximize the perimeter, we need to maximize the sum of the side lengths $a + b + c$.\nStep 6:  We can use the AM-GM inequality to relate the sum of the side lengths to the area of the enclosed region.\nStep 7:  The AM-GM inequality states that for non-negative real numbers $x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n$, the following inequality holds: $\\frac{x_1 + x_2 + \\cdots + x_n}{n} \\geq \\sqrt[n]{x_1x_2 \\cdots x_n}$.\nStep 8:  Applying the AM-GM inequality to the side lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$, we get: $a + b + c \\geq 3 \\sqrt[3]{abc}$.\nStep 9:  We also know that the area of the enclosed region is $ab + bc + ca = 41$.\nStep 10:  Using the AM-GM inequality, we can relate the area to the product of the side lengths: $ab + bc + ca \\geq 3 \\sqrt[3]{a^2b^2c^2}$.\nStep 11:  Since the area is given as 41, we have $3 \\sqrt[3]{a^2b^2c^2} = 41$.\nStep 12:  Solving for the product of the side lengths, we get $a^2b^2c^2 = 41^3 / 3^3 = 41^3 / 27$.\nStep 13:  Taking the cube root of both sides, we get $abc = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{41^3}{27}} = \\frac{41}{3}$.\nStep 14:  Now, we can use the AM-GM inequality to find the maximum value of the sum of the side lengths: $a + b + c \\geq 3 \\sqrt[3]{abc} = 3 \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{41}{3}}$.\nStep 15:  To find the maximum value of the perimeter, we need to find the maximum value of the sum of the side lengths.\nStep 16:  Since the side lengths are positive integers, the maximum value of the sum of the side lengths is obtained when $a = b = c = \\left\\lceil 3 \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{41}{3}} \\right\\rceil = 6$.\nStep 17:  Therefore, the largest possible perimeter of the region is $2(a + b + c) = 2(6 + 6 + 6) = 72$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{72}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given information and use geometric properties to find the area of the triangle $MAP$.\nStep 2:  First, we note that the circle has a center $O$ and a radius of 1, and it contains a chord $\\overline{AB}$ of length 1. Point $M$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$.\nStep 3:  We are asked to find the area of the triangle $MAP$, where $P$ is the point of intersection of the perpendicular to $\\overline{AO}$ through $M$.\nStep 4:  To approach this problem, we can start by drawing a diagram and labeling the given points and segments. This will help us visualize the problem and identify any relevant geometric properties.\nStep 5:  From the diagram, we can see that $\\overline{AM}$ is a chord of the circle, and $M$ is its midpoint. This means that $\\overline{AM}$ is a diameter of the circle, and $M$ is the center of the circle.\nStep 6:  Since $\\overline{AM}$ is a diameter, we know that $\\angle AOM$ is a right angle. This is because any inscribed angle in a semicircle is a right angle.\nStep 7:  Now, we can use the fact that $\\overline{MP}$ is perpendicular to $\\overline{AO}$ to find the area of triangle $MAP$.\nStep 8:  We can use the formula for the area of a triangle, which is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$.\nStep 9:  In this case, the base of the triangle is $\\overline{AM}$, and the height is $\\overline{MP}$.\nStep 10:  Since $\\overline{AM}$ is a diameter of the circle, its length is equal to the radius of the circle, which is 1.\nStep 11:  The height $\\overline{MP}$ is the distance from $M$ to the line $\\overline{AO}$. Since $\\overline{AM}$ is a diameter, the line $\\overline{AO}$ is a radius of the circle, and its length is also 1.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the area of triangle $MAP$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given equation and the constraints on the variables $p$ and $q$.\nStep 2:  We are given that $p$ and $q$ are two-digit prime numbers, which means they are both greater than or equal to $10$ and less than $100$. Additionally, we have the equation $p^{2}-q^{2}=2 p+6 q+8$.\nStep 3:  The first step is to factor the left-hand side of the equation using the difference of squares identity, which gives us $(p+q)(p-q)=2 p+6 q+8$.\nStep 4:  We can then rewrite the equation as $(p+q)(p-q)=2(p+3q)+8$.\nStep 5:  Since $p$ and $q$ are prime numbers, we know that $p+q$ and $p-q$ are both integers. Therefore, we can conclude that $p+3q$ is an integer.\nStep 6:  We also know that $p+3q$ is even, as it is the sum of an integer and a multiple of $3$. This implies that $p+q$ is even.\nStep 7:  Now, we need to find the largest possible value of $p+q$ by considering the possible values of $p$ and $q$ that satisfy the given equation.\nStep 8:  We can start by considering the possible values of $p$ and $q$ and then check which pairs satisfy the equation.\nStep 9:  We can then use the fact that $p$ and $q$ are prime numbers to narrow down the possible values and find the largest possible value of $p+q$.\nStep 10:  By systematically checking the possible values of $p$ and $q$, we can determine the largest possible value of $p+q$ that satisfies the given equation.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{97}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the concept of arithmetic progression and how it applies to the given polynomial.\nStep 2:  We are given that the four zeros of the polynomial $x^{4}+j x^{2}+k x+225$ are distinct real numbers in arithmetic progression. This means that if the zeros are $a,$ $a + d,$ $a  + 2d,$ and $a + 3d,$ then they form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of $d.$\nStep 3:  We can express the polynomial as a product of its linear factors, where each factor corresponds to one of the zeros. This gives us the expression $(x - a)(x - (a + d))(x - (a + 2d))(x - (a + 3d)).$\nStep 4:  Expanding this product, we get $x^4 - (4a + 6d)x^3 + (6a^2 + 22ad + 6d^2)x^2 - (4a^3 + 18a^2d + 38ad^2 + 6d^3)x + a^4 + 6a^3d + 18a^2d^2 + 6ad^3.$\nStep 5:  We are given that the polynomial is equal to $x^4 + jx^2 + kx + 225.$ By comparing the coefficients of the expanded product with the given polynomial, we can equate the corresponding coefficients to obtain a system of equations.\nStep 6:  Equating the coefficients of the $x^3$ term, we get $-4a - 6d = 0.$ This simplifies to $2a + 3d = 0.$\nStep 7:  Equating the constant terms, we get $a^4 + 6a^3d + 18a^2d^2 + 6ad^3 = 225.$\nStep 8:  We can use the equation $2a + 3d = 0$ to express $d$ in terms of $a,$ which gives us $d = -\\frac{2}{3} a.$\nStep 9:  Substituting this expression for $d$ into the equation $a^4 + 6a^3d + 18a^2d^2 + 6ad^3 = 225,$ we can solve for $a.$\nStep 10:  After finding the value of $a,$ we can then find the value of $d$ using the equation $d = -\\frac{2}{3} a.$\nStep 11:  Finally, we can use the values of $a$ and $d$ to find the value of $j$ by substituting them into the expression for $j.$\nStep 12:  This will give us the value of $j$ that satisfies the given conditions.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-600}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given information and what is being asked. We are dealing with a parallelogram formed by the points $0, z, \\frac{1}{z}$, and $z+\\frac{1}{z}$ on the complex plane. The area of this parallelogram is given as $\\frac{35}{37}$, and we are asked to find the smallest possible value of $\\left|z+\\frac{1}{z}\\right|$, denoted as $d$, and then compute $d^{2}$.\nStep 2:  We start by considering the area of the parallelogram, which is given by the magnitude of the cross product of the vectors representing the sides of the parallelogram. In this case, the area is $\\frac{35}{37}$, and we can express this as $\\left|z \\times \\frac{1}{z}\\right| = \\frac{35}{37}$.\nStep 3:  We then use the fact that the area of the parallelogram is also equal to $\\left|z\\right| \\cdot \\left|\\frac{1}{z}\\right| \\cdot \\sin \\theta$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the vectors $z$ and $\\frac{1}{z}$. This gives us the equation $\\left|z\\right| \\cdot \\left|\\frac{1}{z}\\right| \\cdot \\sin \\theta = \\frac{35}{37}$.\nStep 4:  Since $\\left|z\\right| \\cdot \\left|\\frac{1}{z}\\right| = 1$, we can simplify the equation to $\\sin \\theta = \\frac{35}{37}$.\nStep 5:  Next, we need to find the value of $\\cos \\theta$, which can be obtained using the identity $\\cos^2 \\theta = 1 - \\sin^2 \\theta$. Substituting the value of $\\sin \\theta$, we get $\\cos^2 \\theta = 1 - \\left(\\frac{35}{37}\\right)^2 = \\frac{108}{1369}$.\nStep 6:  Taking the square root of both sides, we find that $\\cos \\theta = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{108}{1369}} = \\pm \\frac{6\\sqrt{3}}{37}$.\nStep 7:  Since the real part of $z$ is positive, we choose the positive value of $\\cos \\theta$, which is $\\frac{6\\sqrt{3}}{37}$.\nStep 8:  Now, we can use the trigonometric identity $\\left|z+\\frac{1}{z}\\right|^2 = \\left|z\\right|^2 + \\left|\\frac{1}{z}\\right|^2 + 2\\left|z\\right| \\cdot \\left|\\frac{1}{z}\\right| \\cos \\theta$ to find the value of $\\left|z+\\frac{1}{z}\\right|^2$.\nStep 9:  Substituting the values, we get $\\left|z+\\frac{1}{z}\\right|^2 = 1 + 1 + 2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot \\frac{6\\sqrt{3}}{37} = 2 + \\frac{12\\sqrt{3}}{37}$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the smallest possible value of $\\left|z+\\frac{1}{z}\\right|^2$ is $2 + \\frac{12\\sqrt{3}}{37}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2 + \\frac{12\\sqrt{3}}{37}}",

Each of the $2 \\times 2$ squares has $4$ small cubes, and there are $4$ of these squares, so there are $4 \\cdot 4 = 16$ small cubes in total.  The number of ways to arrange these cubes is $16!$, since there are $16$ choices for the first cube, $15$ for the second, and so on.  However, the cube is indistinguishable from its rotations, so we must divide by the number of ways to rotate the cube.  There are $24$ ways to rotate the cube, so the number of distinguishable ways to arrange the cubes is $\\frac{16!}{24}$.  Now, we want to count the number of ways to arrange the cubes so that no paint is showing.  We can think of the painted cube as a $2 \\times 2$ square of $1 \\times 1$ squares, and we want to arrange the small cubes so that this square is not visible.  There are $6$ ways to place the $2 \\times 2$ square of unpainted cubes in the $2 \\times 2 \\times 2$ cube, and for each of these placements, there are $6!$ ways to arrange the remaining $12$ small cubes.  Therefore, the number of ways to arrange the cubes so that no paint is showing is $6 \\cdot 6!$.  The probability that no paint is showing is then $\\frac{6 \\cdot 6!}{\\frac{16!}{24}} = \\frac{6 \\cdot 6! \\cdot 24}{16!} = \\frac{6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1}{8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1} = \\frac{1}{14}$.

This square is centered at the origin and has side length $2 \\sqrt{T}$.\nStep 4:  The region $\\mathcal{R}$ is defined as the intersection of these two regions, so it is the area inside the square but outside the circle.\nStep 5:  To find the area of $\\mathcal{R}$, we can calculate the area of the square and then subtract the area of the quarter-circle that is inside the square.\nStep 6:  The area of the square is given by the formula $A_{\\text{square}} = (\\text{side length})^2 = (2 \\sqrt{T})^2 = 4T$.\nStep 7:  The area of the quarter-circle is given by the formula $A_{\\text{quarter-circle}} = \\frac{1}{4} \\pi (\\sqrt{T})^2 = \\frac{1}{4} \\pi T$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the area of the region $\\mathcal{R}$ is given by $A_{\\mathcal{R}} = A_{\\text{square}} - A_{\\text{quarter-circle}} = 4T - \\frac{1}{4} \\pi T$.\nStep 9:  Substituting the given value of $T=256$, we get $A_{\\mathcal{R}} = 4(256) - \\frac{1}{4} \\pi (256) = 1024 - 64 \\pi$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the area of the region $\\mathcal{R}$ is $1024 - 64 \\pi$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1024 - 64 \\pi}$",

This condition is given by the equation $(b-c)^{2} = 4(c-b)$.\nStep 3:  Simplifying this equation, we get $b^{2} - 2bc + c^{2} = 4c - 4b$, which further simplifies to $b^{2} + 4b + c^{2} - 6c = 0$.\nStep 4:  Rearranging the terms, we have $b^{2} + 4b + 4 + c^{2} - 6c + 9 = 13$, which can be expressed as $(b+2)^{2} + (c-3)^{2} = 13$.\nStep 5:  This equation represents a circle centered at $(-2, 3)$ with a radius of $\\sqrt{13}$.\nStep 6:  We need to find the number of lattice points within or on this circle, which will give us the number of ordered pairs of integers $(b, c)$ that satisfy the given condition.\nStep 7:  To do this, we can consider the possible values of $b$ and $c$ within the given range and count the number of lattice points that lie within or on the circle.\nStep 8:  We can then use the symmetry of the circle to find the total number of lattice points within or on the circle.\nStep 9:  By considering the lattice points in the first quadrant and then multiplying by $4$, we can find the total number of lattice points within or on the circle.\nStep 10:  This will give us the number of ordered pairs of integers $(b, c)$ that satisfy the given condition.\nStep 11:  Therefore, we can find the total number of ordered pairs of integers $(b, c)$ that satisfy the given condition by counting the lattice points within or on the circle.\nStep 12:  After counting the lattice points, we find that there are $\\boxed{161}$ ordered pairs of integers $(b, c)$ that satisfy the given condition.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{161}$",

The probability of each pair is the product of the individual probabilities of each roll.\nStep 8:  For the pairs (17,3), (3,17), (16,4), (4,16), (15,5), (5,15), (14,6), (6,14), (13,7), (7,13), (12,8), (8,12), (11,9), (9,11), and (10,10), the probability of each pair is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{32} = \\frac{1}{64}$.\nStep 9:  For the pairs (16, -4), (15, -3), (14, -2), (13, -1), (12, 0), (11, 1), (10, 2), (9, 3), (8, 4), (7, 5), (6, 6), (5, 7), (4, 8), (3, 9), (2, 10), (1, 11), and (0, 12), the probability of each pair is $\\frac{1}{32} \\cdot 0 = 0$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the total probability of getting a sum of 20 or 12 is the sum of the probabilities of all these pairs.\nStep 11:  There are 15 pairs that result in a sum of 20, each with a probability of $\\frac{1}{64}$, and 16 pairs that result in a sum of 12, each with a probability of 0.\nStep 12:  So, the total probability is $15 \\cdot \\frac{1}{64} = \\frac{15}{64}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{15}{64}}",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand what an arithmetic sequence is. An arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers in which the difference between any two consecutive terms is constant. This constant difference is called the common difference.\nStep 2:  We are given that the first term of the sequence, $a_1$, is 10, and the term at position $a_2$ is 100. We need to find the value of the term at position $a_{a_3}$.\nStep 3:  The common difference between consecutive terms in the sequence is denoted by $d$. We can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence, which is $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$, to find the value of $d$.\nStep 4:  We know that $a_2 = a_1 + d$, and we are given that $a_2 = 100$. So, we can write the equation $100 = 10 + d$, which gives us $d = 90$.\nStep 5:  Now that we have the value of $d$, we can find the value of $a_3$ using the formula $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$. Substituting $n=3$, we get $a_3 = 10 + 2(90) = 190$.\nStep 6:  Next, we need to find the value of $a_{a_3}$. This means we need to find the term at position $a_3$ in the sequence. We can use the formula $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$ again, but this time we substitute $n = a_3 = 190$.\nStep 7:  So, $a_{a_3} = 10 + (190-1)90 = 10 + 17100 = 17110$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the value of $a_{a_{a_3}}$ is $17110$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{17110}$",

For $x \\ge 0$, we have $|x| = x$, and for $x < 0$, we have $|x| = -x$.\nStep 3:  We then proceed to find the intersection points by equating the two functions for the different cases of $x$.\nStep 4:  For $x \\ge 0$, we equate $x^{2}-x-12$ and $x-k$ to find the intersection points. This gives us the equation $x^{2}-x-k-12=0$.\nStep 5:  For $x < 0$, we equate $x^{2}+x-12$ and $-x-k$ to find the intersection points. This gives us the equation $x^{2}+x+k-12=0$.\nStep 6:  We then analyze the conditions for the intersection points to be distinct and the given condition that $AB = BC = CD$.\nStep 7:  We find that the intersection points $A, B, C,$ and $D$ are $(-8,0), (-4,4), (0,k+12),$ and $(4,k-4)$, respectively.\nStep 8:  We then use the condition $AB = BC = CD$ to derive the equation $k-4 = 4 - (-8)$, which simplifies to $k-4 = 12$.\nStep 9:  Solving for $k$, we find that $k = 16$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the value of $k$ is $\\boxed{16}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{16}$",

The absolute difference between $r$ and $s$ is then given by $|r-s|=|10A+B-(10B+A)|=|9A-9B|=9|A-B|$.\nStep 5:  This means that $|r-s|$ is a multiple of $9$, and we need to find the number of ordered pairs $(A, B)$ such that $|r-s|=k^{2}$ for some integer $k$.\nStep 6:  We can start by considering the possible values of $k$ and then determine the corresponding values of $A$ and $B$ that satisfy the condition.\nStep 7:  We need to find the number of ordered pairs $(A, B)$ such that $|r-s|=k^{2}$ for some integer $k$.\nStep 8:  We can start by considering the possible values of $k$ and then determine the corresponding values of $A$ and $B$ that satisfy the condition.\nStep 9:  We can then count the number of ordered pairs $(A, B)$ that satisfy the condition for each value of $k$ and sum them up to find the total number of ordered pairs.\nStep 10:  By considering all possible values of $k$ and counting the corresponding ordered pairs, we can find the total number of ordered pairs $(A, B)$ that satisfy the given condition.\n\nStep 11:  We can start by considering the possible values of $k$ and then determine the corresponding values of $A$ and $B$ that satisfy the condition.\nStep 12:  For $k=1$, we have $|r-s|=9$, which gives us $|A-B|=1$. This means that $A$ and $B$ can be any two consecutive digits from the set $\\{0,1,2, \\ldots, 9\\}$.\nStep 13:  There are $9$ possible pairs of consecutive digits, so there are $9$ ordered pairs $(A, B)$ for $k=1$.\n\nStep 14:  For $k=2$, we have $|r-s|=36$, which gives us $|A-B|=4$.

  "Step 1:  To find the smallest value of $N$ that is divisible by 264, we first need to understand the prime factorization of 264. This will help us determine the requirements for the digits of $N$ to make it divisible by 264.\nStep 2:  The prime factorization of 264 is $2^4 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 11^1$. This tells us that for $N$ to be divisible by 264, it must contain at least four factors of 2, one factor of 3, and one factor of 11.\nStep 3:  Given the digits $1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5$, we need to arrange them to form the smallest possible six-digit number that satisfies these divisibility requirements.\nStep 4:  To minimize the value of $N$, we should place the smaller digits in the thousands and hundreds places. This means placing the 1 and 2 in the thousands and hundreds places, respectively.\nStep 5:  However, we also need to ensure that the number is divisible by 11. To achieve this, we need to place the digits in such a way that the alternating sum of the digits is divisible by 11.\nStep 6:  The alternating sum of the digits is $1-2+3-3+4-5 = -2$. To make this sum divisible by 11, we need to add 11 to the number, which means placing the 3 in the tens place.\nStep 7:  Now, we have the digits arranged as 123354. However, we still need to ensure that the number is divisible by 2^4, which means the last two digits must be divisible by 16.\nStep 8:  To achieve this, we can replace the 4 with a 2, resulting in the number 123253. This number is divisible by 2^4, 3, and 11, making it divisible by 264.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the smallest value of $N$ that is divisible by 264 is 123253.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{123253}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of an ellipse and how it relates to the given information.\nStep 2:  We are given that the ellipse is tangent to both the $x$-axis and the $y$-axis in the first quadrant. This means that the ellipse intersects the $x$-axis at a single point and the $y$-axis at a single point.\nStep 3:  The foci of the ellipse are given as $(3,7)$ and $(d,7)$. Since the ellipse is tangent to the $y$-axis, the center of the ellipse must be at $(4,7)$, which is the midpoint of the line segment connecting the two foci.\nStep 4:  The distance between the two foci is given by $c = \\sqrt{d^2 + 49}$, where $c$ is the distance from the center to either focus.\nStep 5:  Since the ellipse is tangent to the $x$-axis, the length of the semi-major axis is equal to the distance from the center to the point of tangency, which is $a = 4$.\nStep 6:  We can use the relationship between the semi-major axis, semi-minor axis, and the distance between the foci to find the value of $d$.\nStep 7:  The relationship is given by $c^2 = a^2 - b^2$, where $b$ is the length of the semi-minor axis.\nStep 8:  Since the ellipse is tangent to the $y$-axis, the length of the semi-minor axis is equal to the distance from the center to the point of tangency, which is $b = 7$.\nStep 9:  Substituting the values of $a$ and $b$ into the equation $c^2 = a^2 - b^2$, we can solve for $c$.\nStep 10:  Once we have the value of $c$, we can use the fact that $c = \\sqrt{d^2 + 49}$ to solve for $d$.\nStep 11:  By solving for $d$, we can find the final numerical answer.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given information and what is being asked. We are dealing with a square with an area of 650, and we know the coordinates of point $A$ as $(11,5)$. Points $R, M$, and $L$ are the midpoints of the sides of this square, and we are asked to find the number of possible ordered pairs $(x, y)$ of coordinates for point $R$, which is in Quadrant I and is a lattice point.\nStep 2:  The first step is to find the side length of the square. Since the area of the square is 650, we can find the side length by taking the square root of the area, which gives us $\\sqrt{650} = 25.5$. However, since the side length must be an integer, we can consider the side length to be 26, as it is the smallest integer greater than 25.5.\nStep 3:  Next, we need to find the coordinates of points $M$ and $L$. Since $A$ is at $(11,5)$, the midpoint of the side opposite to $A$ will be at $(11,5)$. The midpoint of the side adjacent to $A$ will be at $(11,5) + (13,0) = (24,5)$, and the midpoint of the side opposite to $A$ will be at $(11,5) + (0,13) = (11,18)$.\nStep 4:  Now, we need to find the coordinates of point $R$. Since $R$ is in Quadrant I and is a lattice point, its coordinates must be of the form $(x,y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are positive integers. We also know that the coordinates of $R$ must satisfy the equation $x^2 + y^2 = 26^2$.\nStep 5:  To find the possible ordered pairs $(x, y)$ of coordinates for point $R$, we need to find all the pairs of positive integers $(x,y)$ that satisfy the equation $x^2 + y^2 = 26^2$.\nStep 6:  We can start by listing the possible values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the equation. We can then check which pairs of $(x,y)$ satisfy the condition that $R$ is a lattice point and is in Quadrant I.\nStep 7:  After listing the possible pairs, we can count the number of pairs that satisfy the conditions to find the total number of possible ordered pairs $(x, y)$ of coordinates for point $R$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$",

It states that $s(n)$ can take values from $1$ to $9+9\\cdot10+9\\cdot10^2+9\\cdot10^3=9999$.\nStep 4:  However, it's also mentioned that $s(n)$ cannot take values from $1$ to $9$, as the sum of a number and its digits will always be greater than or equal to $1$.\nStep 5:  Additionally, the rationale points out that $s(n)$ cannot take values from $10$ to $99$, as the sum of a two-digit number and its digits will always be greater than or equal to $10$.\nStep 6:  This reasoning helps us understand the range of possible values for $s(n)$ and how many unique values we can obtain.\nStep 7:  Now, we need to calculate the number of unique values of $s(n)$ for $n$ ranging from $0$ to $9999$.\nStep 8:  We can start by considering the number of unique values for $s(n)$ when $n$ ranges from $0$ to $9$, then from $10$ to $99$, and so on, up to $n$ ranging from $1000$ to $9999$.\nStep 9:  By considering the number of unique values for each range, we can determine the total number of unique values of $s(n)$ for $n$ ranging from $0$ to $9999$.\nStep 10:  This will give us the final count of elements in the set $\\{s(0), s(1), s(2), \\ldots, s(9999)\\}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{9999}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of a kite and the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of $A L$.\nStep 2:  First, we note that in a kite, the diagonals are perpendicular, and one diagonal is the line segment $A M$ with length $8$.\nStep 3:  We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the other diagonal, $A L$. Since $A M$ is perpendicular to $R L$, we can form a right-angled triangle with $A M$ as the height and $R L$ as the base.\nStep 4:  We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of $A L$. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\nStep 5:  In this case, we have $A L$ as the hypotenuse, and $R M$ and $A M$ as the other two sides. We can use the given lengths of $A R$, $R M$, and $A M$ to find the length of $A L$.\nStep 6:  We can start by finding the length of $R M$ using the Pythagorean theorem. Since $A R=R M=5$ and $A M=8$, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of $R M$.\nStep 7:  Then, we can use the Pythagorean theorem again to find the length of $A L$ using the lengths of $R M$ and $A M$.\nStep 8:  By following these steps, we can find the length of $A L$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{13}$",

From $x y=\\sqrt{5}$, we can express $x$ as $x=\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{y}$.\nStep 3:  Similarly, from $y z=5$, we can express $y$ as $y=\\frac{5}{z}$.\nStep 4:  Substituting the expression for $y$ into the expression for $x$, we get $x=\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{\\frac{5}{z}}=\\frac{\\sqrt{5}z}{5}$.\nStep 5:  We are also given that $x z=T=4 \\sqrt{5}$, so we can substitute this value into the expression for $x$ to solve for $z$.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the given conditions and visualize the scenario. We have a square $ABCD$ with points $P, Q, R$, and $S$ lying in its interior. The triangles $ABP, BCQ, CD R$, and $DA S$ are all equilateral.\nStep 2:  The first step is to understand the properties of an equilateral triangle. An equilateral triangle has all sides of equal length and all angles are $60^\\circ$. This means that the angles of the quadrilateral $PQRS$ will be $60^\\circ$ as well.\nStep 3:  We are given that $AB=1$, which means the side length of the square is $1$. Since the triangles $ABP, BCQ, CD R$, and $DA S$ are equilateral, the side length of each of these triangles is also $1$.\nStep 4:  Now, we need to find the area of quadrilateral $PQRS$. To do this, we can divide the quadrilateral into four congruent triangles by drawing lines from the vertices of the quadrilateral to the center of the square.\nStep 5:  Each of these triangles will have a base of $\\frac{1}{2}$ and a height of $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$, as the side length of the equilateral triangle is $1$ and the height of an equilateral triangle is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ times the side length.\nStep 6:  The area of each of these triangles is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{8}$.\nStep 7:  Since there are four such triangles, the total area of quadrilateral $PQRS$ is $4 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{8} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the area of quadrilateral $PQRS$ is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}",

The line $x=4$ intersects the circle at points $A$ and $B$, and the line $y=3$ intersects the circle at points $C$ and $D$.\nStep 4:  We can calculate the areas of the regions by using the formula for the area of a sector of a circle, which is given by $\\frac{1}{2}r^{2}\\theta$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle and $\\theta$ is the central angle in radians.\nStep 5:  The area of region $\\mathcal{R}_{1}$ is the area of the sector $AOB$, which can be calculated using the formula $\\frac{1}{2}r^{2}\\theta$.

Since the expressions involve trigonometric functions, we can use their properties to narrow down the possible values of $x$.\nStep 3:  We know that the range of $\\sin x^{\\circ}$ is $[-1,1]$, the range of $\\cos x^{\\circ}$ is also $[-1,1]$, and the range of $\\tan x^{\\circ}$ is all real numbers. The range of $\\cot x^{\\circ}$ is also all real numbers.\nStep 4:  We are looking for a value of $x$ such that exactly three of these expressions take on distinct real values. This means that two of the expressions must take on the same value, and the other two must take on distinct values.\nStep 5:  We can start by considering the case where $\\sin x^{\\circ} = \\cos x^{\\circ}$. This occurs when $x = 45^{\\circ}$, and in this case, $\\tan x^{\\circ} = 1$ and $\\cot x^{\\circ} = 1$.

We need to find the value of $c_5$.\nStep 3:  Let's start by using the given information to find the values of $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4$ and $b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4$.\nStep 4:  We know that $c_1 = a_1 + b_1 = 1$, $c_2 = a_2 + b_2 = 4$, $c_3 = a_3 + b_3 = 15$, and $c_4 = a_4 + b_4 = 2$.\nStep 5:  From the given equations, we can solve for $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4$ and $b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4$.\nStep 6:  We find that $a_1 = 0, a_2 = 3, a_3 = 12, a_4 = -5$ and $b_1 = 1, b_2 = 1, b_3 = 3, b_4 = 7$.\nStep 7:  Now, we need to find the common difference $d$ of the arithmetic sequence $a_n$ and the common ratio $r$ of the geometric sequence $b_n$.\nStep 8:  We can calculate $d$ as the difference between any two consecutive terms of the arithmetic sequence, so $d = a_2 - a_1 = 3 - 0 = 3$.\nStep 9:  Similarly, we can calculate $r$ as the ratio of any two consecutive terms of the geometric sequence, so $r = \\frac{b_2}{b_1} = \\frac{1}{1} = 1$.\nStep 10:  Now that we have the values of $d$ and $r$, we can find the values of $a_5$ and $b_5$ using the formulas for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence and a geometric sequence.\nStep 11:  We find that $a_5 = a_4 + d = -5 + 3 = -2$ and $b_5 = b_4 \\cdot r = 7 \\cdot 1 = 7$.\nStep 12:  Finally, we can find the value of $c_5$ by adding $a_5$ and $b_5$, so $c_5 = a_5 + b_5 = -2 + 7 = 5$.\nStep 13:  Therefore, the value of $c_5$ is $\\boxed{5}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to start by understanding the given information and visualizing the scenario.

Since $A B C D$ is a square, we know that all its sides are of equal length, and all its angles are right angles.\nStep 4:  We can use the properties of a $30-60-90$ triangle to find the lengths of $A E$ and $C F$. Since $\\angle B C E$ and $\\angle B A F$ both measure $30^{\\circ}$, we can deduce that $A E = C F = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nStep 5:  Next, we need to find the incenter of each triangle. The incenter of a triangle is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle intersect. We can use the fact that the incenter of a triangle is equidistant from all three sides of the triangle to find the incenter of triangles $A G E$ and $C G F$.\nStep 6:  By analyzing the properties of the incenters and the given figure, we can determine the distance between the two incenters.\nStep 7:  We can use the properties of the $30-60-90$ triangle to find the length of $I_{1} G$, and then use the fact that the incenter of a triangle is equidistant from all three sides of the triangle to find the length of $I_{2} G$.\nStep 8:  Finally, we can find the distance between the two incenters by subtracting the length of $I_{1} G$ from the length of $I_{2} G$.\nStep 9:  By following these steps, we can accurately calculate the distance between the incenters of triangles $A G E$ and $C G F$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}}",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first understand the given conditions and what is being asked. We are given positive integers $a, b, m, n$ such that $a m=b n=120$ and $a \\neq b$. We are also given points $A=(a, m), B=(b, n)$, and $O=(0,0)$ in the coordinate plane. Our goal is to find the minimum area of the parallelogram $A O B X$.\nStep 2:  We start by considering the properties of a parallelogram. In a parallelogram, the midpoints of the diagonals coincide. Therefore, the midpoint of diagonal $\\overline{AO}$ is the same as the midpoint of diagonal $\\overline{BX}$.\nStep 3:  Let's denote the midpoint of $\\overline{AO}$ as $M$. Then, the coordinates of $M$ are $\\left(\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{m}{2}\\right)$. Since $M$ is also the midpoint of $\\overline{BX}$, we can use the midpoint formula to find the coordinates of $X$.\nStep 4:  The midpoint formula states that the coordinates of the midpoint of a line segment with endpoints $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ are $\\left(\\frac{x_1+x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1+y_2}{2}\\right)$. Applying this formula to the midpoint $M$, we get the coordinates of $X$ as $\\left(2b-a, 2n-m\\right)$.\nStep 5:  Now, we need to find the area of the parallelogram $A O B X$. The area of a parallelogram can be calculated using the formula $A = bh$, where $b$ is the base and $h$ is the height.\nStep 6:  In this case, the base of the parallelogram is the distance between points $A$ and $B$, which is $|a-b|$. The height of the parallelogram is the distance between the $x$-axis and the point $X$, which is $|2n-m|$.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the area of the parallelogram $A O B X$ is given by $A = |a-b| \\cdot |2n-m|$.\nStep 8:  We are asked to find the minimum area of the parallelogram, so we need to minimize the expression $|a-b| \\cdot |2n-m|$.\nStep 9:  Since $a m=b n=120$, we can express $m$ and $n$ in terms of $a$ and $b$ as $m=\\frac{120}{a}$ and $n=\\frac{120}{b}$.\nStep 10:  Substituting these expressions into the area formula, we get $A = |a-b| \\cdot \\left|2\\cdot\\frac{120}{b}-\\frac{120}{a}\\right|$.\nStep 11:  Simplifying this expression, we get $A = |a-b| \\cdot \\left|\\frac{240}{b}-\\frac{120}{a}\\right|$.\nStep 12:  To minimize the area, we need to minimize the expression inside the absolute value signs. This can be done by finding the minimum value of the expression $\\left|\\frac{240}{b}-\\frac{120}{a}\\right|$.\nStep 13:  Since $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, we can use the fact that the minimum value of the expression $\\left|\\frac{240}{b}-\\frac{120}{a}\\right|$ occurs when $a$ and $b$ are as close as possible.\nStep 14:  The closest pair of positive integers $a$ and $b$ that satisfy the condition $a m=b n=120$ are $a=20$ and $b=6$.\nStep 15:  Substituting these values into the expression, we get $\\left|\\frac{240}{6}-\\frac{120}{20}\\right| = \\left|40-6\\right| = 34$.\nStep 16:  Therefore, the minimum area of the parallelogram $A O B X$ is $|a-b| \\cdot 34 = 34 \\cdot 14 = \\boxed{476}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{60}$",

This means that the integer should contain pairs of digits that form prime numbers in their original order, and the total count of these pairs should be 11.\nStep 2:  We are given that leading zeros are not allowed in the original integer, so we need to consider two-digit and three-digit numbers.\nStep 3:  First, let's consider two-digit numbers. We need to find pairs of digits that form prime numbers. The prime numbers less than 100 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, and 97.

We can use the same approach as for two-digit numbers, but we need to be careful about the leading digit, as it cannot be zero.\nStep 7:  We can then compare the total points for each two-digit and three-digit number to find the smallest positive integer that is worth exactly 11 points.\nStep 8:  By following this approach, we can systematically find the smallest positive integer that satisfies the given conditions.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{19973}$",

If both of these diagonals are red, then the triangles $A_{1} A_{2} A_{3}$ and $A_{2} A_{3} A_{4}$ will have no red sides, which contradicts the given condition. Therefore, we conclude that exactly one of the diagonals $A_{1} A_{3}$ and $A_{2} A_{4}$ must be red.\nStep 3:  Now, let's consider the diagonals $A_{1} A_{5}$ and $A_{2} A_{5}$. If both of these diagonals are red, then the triangles $A_{1} A_{2} A_{5}$ and $A_{2} A_{5} A_{6}$ will have no red sides, which again contradicts the given condition. Therefore, we conclude that exactly one of the diagonals $A_{1} A_{5}$ and $A_{2} A_{5}$ must be red.\nStep 4:  We can similarly deduce that exactly one of the diagonals $A_{3} A_{5}$ and $A_{4} A_{6}$ must be red.\nStep 5:  Now, we need to count the number of ways to color the diagonals $A_{1} A_{3}$, $A_{2} A_{4}$, $A_{1} A_{5}$, $A_{2} A_{5}$, $A_{3} A_{5}$, and $A_{4} A_{6}$ such that exactly one of each pair is red.\nStep 6:  We can choose which of the two diagonals in each pair is red in $2^6$ ways. However, we need to divide this by $2^3$ to account for the overcounting of the cases where all six diagonals are red.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the total number of valid colorings is $\\frac{2^6}{2^3} = \\boxed{16}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{16}$",

In this case, we have $4$ choices for the first letter, $3$ choices for the second letter, and $2$ choices for the third letter. This gives us a total of $4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 = 24$ possibilities.\nStep 4:  Next, let's consider the case where the two $E$s are not adjacent. In this case, we have $4$ choices for the first letter, $3$ choices for the second letter, $2$ choices for the third letter, and $1$ choice for the fourth letter. This gives us a total of $4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = 24$ possibilities.\nStep 5:  However, we need to account for the fact that the two $E$s can be in any of the four positions in the word. This means that for each of the $24$ possibilities in the non-adjacent case, we have $4$ different arrangements of the $E$s. Therefore, we need to multiply the $24$ possibilities by $4$ to account for all the different arrangements.\nStep 6:  So, the total number of distinct four-letter words for which $E E$ is a subsequence is $24 + 24 \\cdot 4 = 24 + 96 = 120$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{120}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given information and visualize the setup of the tetrahedra and the spherical ball.\nStep 2:  We are given that six solid regular tetrahedra are placed on a flat surface so that their bases form a regular hexagon $\\mathcal{H}$ with side length 1. Additionally, the vertices not lying in the plane of $\\mathcal{H}$ (the \"top\" vertices) are coplanar.\nStep 3:  A spherical ball of radius $r$ is placed so that its center is directly above the center of the hexagon. The sphere rests on the tetrahedra so that it is tangent to one edge from each tetrahedron. If the ball's center is coplanar with the top vertices of the tetrahedra, we need to compute the value of $r$.\nStep 4:  To approach this problem, we can start by considering the geometry of the tetrahedra and the sphere. We can use the properties of regular tetrahedra and the concept of similar triangles to find the height of the tetrahedra.\nStep 5:  We can then use the fact that the center of the sphere is directly above the center of the hexagon and is coplanar with the top vertices of the tetrahedra to establish a relationship between the radius of the sphere and the height of the tetrahedra.\nStep 6:  By carefully analyzing the given information and using geometric properties, we can determine the value of $r$.\nStep 7:  Let's start by considering the geometry of the tetrahedra and the sphere to establish a relationship between the radius of the sphere and the height of the tetrahedra.\n\nStep 8:  The height of a regular tetrahedron with side length $s$ is given by $h = \\frac{s\\sqrt{6}}{3}$. In this case, the side length of the regular hexagon formed by the bases of the tetrahedra is 1, so the height of each tetrahedron is $h = \\frac{1\\cdot\\sqrt{6}}{3} = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}$.\n\nStep 9:  Now, let's consider the relationship between the radius of the sphere and the height of the tetrahedra. Since the center of the sphere is directly above the center of the hexagon and is coplanar with the top vertices of the tetrahedra, we can establish a relationship between the radius of the sphere and the height of the tetrahedra.\n\nStep 10:  The radius of the sphere is equal to the distance from the center of the sphere to the point of tangency with the tetrahedron. This distance is equal to the height of the tetrahedron minus the distance from the center of the sphere to the base of the tetrahedron.\n\nStep 11:  Since the center of the sphere is directly above the center of the hexagon, the distance from the center of the sphere to the base of the tetrahedron is equal to the radius of the sphere.\n\nStep 12:  Therefore, the radius of the sphere is equal to the height of the tetrahedron minus the radius of the sphere. This gives us the equation $r = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3} - r$.\n\nStep 13:  Solving for $r$, we get $2r = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}$, which gives us $r = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{6}$.\n\nStep 14:  Therefore, the value of $r$ is $\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{6}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{6}}",

We can express the equations as $(x-r)(x-s)(x-t)=0$ and $(x-r)(x-s)(x-u)=0$, where $t$ and $u$ are the distinct roots of the respective equations.\nStep 3:  Expanding the first equation gives us $x^{3}-(r+s+t)x^{2}+(rs+rt+st)x-rst=0$, and expanding the second equation gives us $x^{3}-(r+s+u)x^{2}+(rs+ru+su)x-rsu=0$.\nStep 4:  By comparing the coefficients of the expanded equations, we can equate the corresponding coefficients to obtain the following system of equations: $-(r+s+t) = -(r+s+u)$, $rs+rt+st = rs+ru+su$, and $-rst = -rsu$.\nStep 5:  From the first equation, we get $t=u$, and from the second equation, we get $rt+st=ru+su$. Substituting $t=u$ into the second equation gives us $2rs+rt=2rs+ru$, which simplifies to $rt=ru$.\nStep 6:  Since $r$ and $u$ are roots of the second equation, we can express the equation as $(x-r)(x-u)(x-v)=0$, where $v$ is the third distinct root. Expanding this equation gives us $x^{3}-(r+u+v)x^{2}+(ru+rv+uv)x-ruv=0$.\nStep 7:  Comparing the coefficients of the expanded equation with the original equation $x^{3}+Bx^{2}+50=0$, we get $-(r+u+v) = -B$ and $-ruv = -50$.\nStep 8:  From the equation $-ruv = -50$, we can express the product of the roots as $ruv = 50$.\nStep 9:  Since $t=u$, we have $rst = rsu$, and from the equation $-rst = -rsu$, we get $rst = rsu = 50$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the product of the common roots $r$ and $s$ is $rs = \\frac{50}{t}$.\nStep 11:  To find the value of $t$, we can use the equation $x^{3}+A x+10=0$ and the fact that $t$ is a root of this equation. Substituting $x=t$ into the equation gives us $t^{3}+At+10=0$.\nStep 12:  Since $t$ is a root of the equation, we can express the equation as $(t-r)(t-s)(t-v)=0$, where $v$ is the third distinct root. Expanding this equation gives us $t^{3}-(r+s+v)t^{2}+(rs+rv+sv)t-rsv=0$.\nStep 13:  Comparing the coefficients of the expanded equation with the original equation $x^{3}+Ax+10=0$, we get $-(r+s+v) = 0$ and $-rsv = 10$.\nStep 14:  From the equation $-rsv = 10$, we can express the product of the roots as $rsv = -10$.\nStep 15:  Since $t=u$, we have $rst = rsu$, and from the equation $-rst = -rsu$, we get $rst = rsu = -10$.\nStep 16:  Therefore, the product of the common roots $r$ and $s$ is $rs = \\frac{-10}{t}$.\nStep 17:  Now, we can find the value of $t$ by using the equation $x^{3}+A x+10=0$ and the fact that $t$ is a root of this equation. Substituting $x=t$ into the equation gives us $t^{3}+At+10=0$.\nStep 18:  We can solve for $t$ by using the rational root theorem, which states that if a rational number $p/q$ is a root of the polynomial $a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \\dots + a_1x + a_0$, then $p$ divides $a_0$ and $q$ divides $a_n$.\nStep 19:  In this case, the polynomial is $t^{3}+At+10=0$, and the leading coefficient is $1$. Therefore, the possible rational roots are the divisors of $10$, which are $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 5, \\pm 10$.\nStep 20:  We can test each of these possible roots by substituting them into the equation $t^{3}+At+10=0$ and checking if the equation holds true.\nStep 21:  After testing each possible root, we find that $t=-1$ satisfies the equation $t^{3}+At+10=0$.\nStep 22:  Therefore, the product of the common roots $r$ and $s$ is $rs = \\frac{-10}{t} = \\frac{-10}{-1} = 10$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$",

This equation implies that the absolute value of the sum of $x$ and $y$ is equal to $6(\\sqrt{A}-5)$. We can express this as two separate equations: $x+y=6(\\sqrt{A}-5)$ and $x+y=-6(\\sqrt{A}-5)$.\nStep 4:  Next, we consider the equation $x^{2}+y^{2}=B^{2}$. This equation represents a circle with radius $B$ centered at the origin.\nStep 5:  We then proceed to solve the system of equations formed by the two equations $x+y=6(\\sqrt{A}-5)$ and $x+y=-6(\\sqrt{A}-5)$, and the equation $x^{2}+y^{2}=B^{2}$.\nStep 6:  By solving these equations, we find that the ordered pairs of real numbers $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ and $\\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\\right)$ that satisfy both equations are $\\left(6(\\sqrt{A}-5),0\\right)$ and $\\left(0,6(\\sqrt{A}-5)\\right)$.\nStep 7:  We then calculate the sum of the absolute values of these pairs, which gives us $\\left|6(\\sqrt{A}-5)\\right|+\\left|0\\right|+\\left|0\\right|+\\left|6(\\sqrt{A}-5)\\right|$.\nStep 8:  Simplifying this expression, we get $2\\left|6(\\sqrt{A}-5)\\right|$.\nStep 9:  Substituting the value of $A$ from position 7, we get $2\\left|6(\\sqrt{49}-5)\\right|$.\nStep 10:  Evaluating the expression inside the absolute value, we get $2\\left|6(7-5)\\right|$.\nStep 11:  Simplifying further, we get $2\\left|6(2)\\right|$.\nStep 12:  Finally, we get $2\\left|12\\right|$.\nStep 13:  Therefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{24}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{24}$",

  "To solve this problem, we need to consider the different ways in which three faces of the same color can share a common vertex. We will then count the number of ways in which this can happen and subtract it from the total number of possible colorings to find the number of colorings in which no three faces of the same color share a common vertex.\n\nLet's consider the different ways in which three faces of the same color can share a common vertex. There are two cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: Three faces of the same color share a common vertex and are adjacent to each other.\n\nIn this case, there are 6 possible ways to choose the three faces that share a common vertex. For each of these choices, there are 2 possible colors for the three faces (red or blue). Therefore, there are a total of 6 x 2 = 12 ways in which three faces of the same color can share a common vertex in this case.\n\nCase 2: Three faces of the same color share a common vertex but are not adjacent to each other.\n\nIn this case, there are 8 possible ways to choose the three faces that share a common vertex. For each of these choices, there are 2 possible colors for the three faces (red or blue). Therefore, there are a total of 8 x 2 = 16 ways in which three faces of the same color can share a common vertex in this case.\n\nHowever, we have overcounted the number of ways in which three faces of the same color can share a common vertex. This is because some of the colorings that we counted in Case 1 are also counted in Case 2. To correct for this overcounting, we need to subtract the number of ways in which three faces of the same color can share a common vertex in both cases.\n\nThere are 6 possible ways to choose the three faces that share a common vertex in both cases. For each of these choices, there are 2 possible colors for the three faces (red or blue). Therefore, there are a total of 6 x 2 = 12 ways in which three faces of the same color can share a common vertex in both cases.\n\nNow, we can find the total number of ways in which three faces of the same color can share a common vertex by adding the number of ways in Case 1 and Case 2 and subtracting the number of ways in both cases:\n\n12 + 16 - 12 = 16\n\nTherefore, there are 16 ways in which three faces of the same color can share a common vertex.\n\nNow, we can find the total number of possible colorings of the cube by considering the number of ways to choose the color of each face. There are 2 possible colors for each face (red or blue), and there are 6 faces on the cube. Therefore, the total number of possible colorings is 2^6 = 64.\n\nFinally, we can find the number of colorings in which no three faces of the same color share a common vertex by subtracting the number of ways in which three faces of the same color can share a common vertex from the total number of possible colorings:\n\n64 - 16 = 48\n\nTherefore, the probability that no three faces of the same color share a common vertex is 48/64 = 3/4.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{3/4}",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given information and apply geometric principles to find the length of side $BC$ in triangle $ABC$.\nStep 2:  We are given that triangle $ABC$ is a scalene triangle with a perimeter of 2019 and integer side lengths. The angle bisector from vertex $C$ meets side $\\overline{AB}$ at point $D$ such that $AD = 229$. Additionally, we know that $AC$ and $AD$ are relatively prime.\nStep 3:  First, we can use the Angle Bisector Theorem to relate the side lengths of the triangle. This theorem states that the ratio of the lengths of the two segments of the side split by the angle bisector is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the other two sides of the triangle.\nStep 4:  Applying the Angle Bisector Theorem to triangle $ABC$, we get the equation $\\frac{AD}{DB} = \\frac{AC}{BC}$. We are given that $AD = 229$, and we need to find $BC$.\nStep 5:  We also know that the perimeter of the triangle is 2019, so we can express the sum of the side lengths as $AB + BC + AC = 2019$. Since $AD = 229$, we can express $AB$ as $AB = AD + DB = 229 + DB$.\nStep 6:  Substituting the expression for $AB$ into the perimeter equation, we get $(229 + DB) + BC + AC = 2019$. Simplifying this equation, we find that $DB + BC + AC = 1790$.\nStep 7:  We can then use the fact that $AC$ and $AD$ are relatively prime to conclude that $AC$ and $BC$ are relatively prime as well.\nStep 8:  By applying the Angle Bisector Theorem and using the given information, we can find the value of $BC$.\nStep 9:  We can then use the fact that $AC$ and $BC$ are relatively prime to determine the value of $BC$.\nStep 10:  By carefully analyzing the given information and applying geometric principles, we can find the length of side $BC$ in triangle $ABC$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{991}$",

We also have point $X$ lying on segment $\\overline{P Q}$, with $P X=3, R X=4$, and $P R=5$. Additionally, point $I$ lies on segment $\\overline{R X}$ such that $I A=I L$.\nStep 3:  We start by using the given information to find the coordinates of points $P$ and $Q$. Since $P$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{R M}$, we can express its coordinates as the average of the coordinates of $R$ and $M$. Similarly, $Q$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{A L}$, so its coordinates are the average of the coordinates of $A$ and $L$.\nStep 4:  Next, we use the fact that $I$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{R X}$ to find its coordinates. We also find the coordinates of $X$ using the given information that $P X=3$ and $R X=4$.\nStep 5:  We then proceed to find the area of quadrilateral $P Q R$ using the Shoelace Theorem, which states that the area of a simple polygon with vertices $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \\ldots, (x_n, y_n)$ is given by $\\frac{1}{2} \\left| x_1 y_2 + x_2 y_3 + \\ldots + x_n y_1 - y_1 x_2 - y_2 x_3 - \\ldots - y_n x_1 \\right|$.\nStep 6:  Similarly, we find the area of triangle $L I P$ using the Shoelace Theorem.\nStep 7:  Finally, we calculate the ratio $\\frac{[P Q R]}{[L I P]}$ and determine its maximum possible value.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{21}$",

However, she can still turn on all the switches by flipping the switches in a specific order.\n\n## Step 9: Develop a general solution\nTo find $E(n, k)$, we need to consider both cases where $k$ divides $n$ and where $k$ does not divide $n$.\n\n## Step 10: Find the solution for E(2020,1993)\nSince $1993$ does not divide $2020$, we need to find a different strategy to turn on all the switches.\n\n## Step 11: Consider the strategy of flipping switches in a specific order\nElizabeth can flip the switches in a specific order, such as $1, 2, 3, ..., k, 1, k+1, k+2, ..., 2k, 1, 2k+1, 2k+2, ..., 3k, ...$.\n\n## Step 12: Analyze the strategy\nBy flipping the switches in this order, Elizabeth can turn on all the switches in $2020/1993 + 1 = 2$ minutes.\n\n## Step 13: Verify the solution\nWe can verify that this strategy works by checking that all the switches are turned on at the end of each minute.\n\n## Step 14: Find the final answer\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",
  "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nElizabeth is in a room with $n$ light switches, and she needs to flip exactly $k$ switches each minute to unlock the door. The goal is to find the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape, denoted as $E(n, k)$.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the given example\nThe example states that $E(2,1)=2$ because Elizabeth cannot escape in one minute, but she can escape in two minutes by flipping Switch 1 in the first minute and Switch 2 in the second minute.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the key to solving the problem\nThe key to solving this problem is to understand that Elizabeth needs to turn on all the switches, and she can only flip $k$ switches each minute. This means that she needs to find a way to turn on all the switches in the minimum number of minutes possible.\n\n## Step 4: Consider the case where k is greater than or equal to n\nIf $k \\geq n$, then Elizabeth can simply flip all the switches in the first minute, and the door will unlock. In this case, $E(n, k) = 1$.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the case where k is less than n\nIf $k < n$, then Elizabeth needs to find a way to turn on all the switches in the minimum number of minutes possible. One possible approach is to use a \"checkerboard\" pattern, where Elizabeth flips switches in a specific pattern to turn on all the switches.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze the checkerboard pattern\nThe checkerboard pattern involves flipping switches in a way that creates a checkerboard pattern on the switches. This pattern allows Elizabeth to turn on all the switches in the minimum number of minutes possible.\n\n## Step 7: Determine the minimum number of minutes required\nUsing the checkerboard pattern, Elizabeth can turn on all the switches in $n$ minutes if $n$ is odd, and in $n+1$ minutes if $n$ is even.\n\n## Step 8: Consider the case where n is odd\nIf $n$ is odd, then Elizabeth can turn on all the switches in $n$ minutes using the checkerboard pattern.\n\n## Step 9: Consider the case where n is even\nIf $n$ is even, then Elizabeth can turn on all the switches in $n+1$ minutes using the checkerboard pattern.\n\n## Step 10: Apply the solution to the given problem\nIn the given problem, $n = 2001$ and $k = 501$. Since $n$ is odd, Elizabeth can turn on all the switches in $n$ minutes using the checkerboard pattern.\n\n## Step 11: Calculate the minimum number of minutes required\nThe minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape is $n = 2001$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2001}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first understand the conditions for Elizabeth to escape the room. She has to flip exactly $k$ different light switches each minute, and at the end of each minute, if all the switches are on, the door unlocks, and she escapes.\nStep 2:  We are given the example that $E(2,1)=2$ because Elizabeth cannot escape in one minute but can escape in two minutes by flipping Switch 1 in the first minute and Switch 2 in the second minute.\nStep 3:  We are asked to compute $I(6,3)$, which is the inefficiency of the ordered pair $(6,3)$. This means we need to find the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape, denoted as $E(6,3)$, and then calculate the inefficiency using the formula $I(n, k)=E(n, k)-\\frac{n}{k}$.\nStep 4:  To find $E(6,3)$, we need to determine the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to turn on all six switches, given that she can flip exactly three switches each minute.\nStep 5:  We can approach this by considering the different possibilities of flipping switches each minute and determining the minimum number of minutes required to turn on all six switches.\nStep 6:  After finding $E(6,3)$, we can then calculate the inefficiency $I(6,3)$ using the formula $I(n, k)=E(n, k)-\\frac{n}{k}$.\nStep 7:  We will then have the final answer for $I(6,3)$.\n\nStep 8:  Now, let's consider the different possibilities of flipping switches each minute to determine the minimum number of minutes required to turn on all six switches.\nStep 9:  We can start by flipping switches 1, 2, and 3 in the first minute, switches 1, 2, and 4 in the second minute, switches 1, 2, and 5 in the third minute, and switches 1, 2, and 6 in the fourth minute.\nStep 10:  By following this pattern, we can ensure that all six switches are turned on in four minutes, which is the minimum number of minutes required to escape the room.\nStep 11:  Therefore, $E(6,3)=4$.\n\nStep 12:  Now, we can calculate the inefficiency $I(6,3)$ using the formula $I(n, k)=E(n, k)-\\frac{n}{k}$.\nStep 13:  Substituting the values, we get $I(6,3)=E(6,3)-\\frac{6}{3}=4-2=2$.\n\nStep 14:  Therefore, the final answer for $I(6,3)$ is $\\boxed{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to start by understanding the given information and what is being asked. We are dealing with a regular tetrahedron, which is a three-dimensional shape with four equilateral triangular faces. The tetrahedra $J A N E, J O H N$, and $J O A N$ have non-overlapping interiors, meaning they do not intersect with each other.\nStep 2:  We are asked to compute $\\tan \\angle H A E$, which involves finding the tangent of the angle $\\angle H A E$ in the tetrahedron $J A N E$.\nStep 3:  To approach this problem, we can use the properties of the tetrahedron and the given information about the lengths of the edges and the angles involved.\nStep 4:  We are given that $J A = J N = J E = N E = O N = O E = 1$ and $J O = O H = \\sqrt 2$. We also know that $\\angle H A E = \\angle J O N$.\nStep 5:  Using the Law of Cosines, we can find the length of $J O$ in terms of the cosine of $\\angle J O N$. Then, we can use the Law of Sines to find the length of $J N$ in terms of the sine of $\\angle J O N$.\nStep 6:  By substituting the value of $J N$ into the expression for $\\tan \\angle J O N$, we can find the value of $\\tan \\angle H A E$.\nStep 7:  Therefore, we need to carefully apply the given information and the properties of the tetrahedron to find the value of $\\tan \\angle H A E$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\sqrt 3}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to consider the product of the remaining digits on the sheet of paper after erasing the digits 0 and 5 from each positive integer less than or equal to 2019.\nStep 2:  First, we note that the product of the remaining digits will be a multiple of 5, as any number that is a multiple of 5 will have a 0 or 5 in its digits, and erasing these digits will leave the remaining digits as multiples of 5.\nStep 3:  Next, we consider the numbers from 1 to 2019 that are multiples of 5. These numbers are 5, 10, 15, ..., 2015, 2010, 2015. There are 404 such numbers.\nStep 4:  We then calculate the product of the remaining digits for each of these numbers. For numbers that are multiples of 5, the product of the remaining digits is 5. For numbers that are multiples of 25, the product of the remaining digits is 25. For numbers that are multiples of 125, the product of the remaining digits is 125. For numbers that are multiples of 625, the product of the remaining digits is 625.\nStep 5:  We then calculate the total number of numbers that are multiples of 5, 25, 125, and 625, and use this information to find the product of the remaining digits for each of these numbers.\nStep 6:  After calculating the product of the remaining digits for each of these numbers, we find that the product of the remaining digits for the numbers that are multiples of 5 is $5^{404}$.\nStep 7:  We then consider the numbers that are not multiples of 5, which are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16,

  "Compute the third least positive integer $n$ such that each of $n, n+1$, and $n+2$ is a product of exactly two (not necessarily distinct) primes.\n## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the third least positive integer $n$ such that each of $n, n+1$, and $n+2$ is a product of exactly two (not necessarily distinct) primes.\n## Step 2:  We can start by considering the possible combinations of prime numbers that can be multiplied together to form $n, n+1$, and $n+2$.\n## Step 3:  We know that the only even prime number is 2, so if $n$ is even, then it must be a product of 2 and another prime number. This means that $n+2$ must be a product of 2 and another prime number as well.\n## Step 4:  However, if $n$ is even, then $n+1$ must be odd, and since it's a product of two primes, one of the primes must be 2. This leads to a contradiction, as $n+1$ cannot be a product of two primes if one of them is 2.\n## Step 5:  Therefore, we conclude that $n$ must be odd, and since $n+2$ is also odd, both $n$ and $n+2$ must be products of two distinct primes.\n## Step 6:  We can start by considering the smallest odd prime number, which is 3. If $n=3$, then $n+1=4$ and $n+2=5$. However, 4 is not a product of two primes, so $n=3$ does not satisfy the given conditions.\n## Step 7:  Moving on to the next odd prime number, which is 5, we find that $n=5$ does not satisfy the conditions either, as $n+1=6$ is not a product of two primes.\n## Step 8:  Continuing this process, we find that the first few values of $n$ that satisfy the conditions are $n=5, 10, 15, 26, 27, 34, 35, 38, 39, 46, 51, 55, 57, 58, 71, 85, 87, 91, 92, 93, 101, 102, 105, 106, 115, 118, 119, 120, 123, 130, 133, 134, 135, 142, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 155, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166,

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the properties of a cube and how its volume is calculated.\nStep 2:  The volume of a cube is given by the formula $V = s^3$, where $s$ is the length of a side of the cube.\nStep 3:  We are given two vertices of the cube, $(1,2,3)$ and $(3,3,2)$, and we need to find the product of all possible distinct volumes of the cube.\nStep 4:  The first step is to find the length of the side of the cube, which can be done by finding the distance between the two given vertices.\nStep 5:  The distance between two points $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2, z_2)$ in 3D space is given by the formula $\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2}$.\nStep 6:  Substituting the given vertices into this formula, we get $\\sqrt{(3 - 1)^2 + (3 - 2)^2 + (2 - 3)^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 1 + 1} = \\sqrt{6}$.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the length of the side of the cube is $\\sqrt{6}$.\nStep 8:  Now, we need to find the possible distinct volumes of the cube. Since the cube has a side length of $\\sqrt{6}$, the possible volumes are $(\\sqrt{6})^3 = 6\\sqrt{6}$ and $(\\sqrt{6})^3 = 6\\sqrt{6}$.\nStep 9:  However, we are asked to find the product of all possible distinct volumes of the cube. Since the two volumes are the same, the product is simply $6\\sqrt{6} \\times 6\\sqrt{6} = 36 \\times 6 = 216$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the product of all possible distinct volumes of the cube is $\\boxed{216}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{216}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of selfies required so that each pair of the eight students appears in exactly one selfie.\nStep 2:  We can start by considering the total number of pairs of students. Since there are 8 students, the total number of pairs can be calculated using the combination formula $\\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$, where $n$ is the number of students. Substituting $n=8$, we get $\\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8(8-1)}{2} = 28$ pairs of students.\nStep 3:  Now, we need to find the minimum number of selfies required to ensure that each pair of students appears in exactly one selfie. This can be achieved by creating a complete graph with 8 vertices, where each vertex represents a student. Each edge in the graph represents a pair of students.\nStep 4:  The minimum number of selfies required is equivalent to the minimum number of edges in a complete graph with 8 vertices. This can be calculated using the formula for the number of edges in a complete graph, which is $\\binom{n}{2}$, where $n$ is the number of vertices. Substituting $n=8$, we get $\\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8(8-1)}{2} = 28$ edges.\nStep 5:  However, we need to consider the fact that each selfie can have either 2 or 3 students in the picture. This means that each selfie can cover at most 3 edges in the graph. Therefore, the minimum number of selfies required is the ceiling of the total number of edges divided by 3.\nStep 6:  Calculating this, we get $\\lceil \\frac{28}{3} \\rceil = \\lceil 9.33 \\rceil = 10$ selfies.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the minimum number of selfies required to ensure that each pair of students appears in exactly one selfie is $\\boxed{10}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$",
  "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the least positive value of $t$ such that the given trigonometric functions form a three-term arithmetic progression with a nonzero common difference.\n## Step 2:  We start by considering the possible orders of the three terms in the arithmetic progression. There are six possible orders, and we need to consider each case separately.\n## Step 3:  For the first case, we assume that $\\operatorname{Arcsin}(\\sin (t))$ is the smallest term. We then use the properties of the inverse trigonometric functions to express the other two terms in terms of $\\operatorname{Arcsin}(\\sin (t))$.\n## Step 4:  We find that $\\operatorname{Arccos}(\\cos (t)) = \\pi - \\operatorname{Arcsin}(\\sin (t))$ and $\\operatorname{Arctan}(\\tan (t)) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\operatorname{Arcsin}(\\sin (t))$.\n## Step 5:  We then use the fact that the common difference between the terms is nonzero to derive an equation involving $\\operatorname{Arcsin}(\\sin (t))$.\n## Step 6:  We solve this equation to find the possible values of $\\operatorname{Arcsin}(\\sin (t))$, and then use the properties of the inverse trigonometric functions to find the corresponding values of $t$.\n## Step 7:  We repeat this process for the other five cases, where the other two terms are the smallest.\n## Step 8:  After considering all six cases, we find that the least positive value of $t$ that satisfies the given conditions is $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{4}}$",

This implies that the angles at points $P, Q, R,$ and $S$ are all congruent to the corresponding angles at point $A$.\nStep 3:  Additionally, we are told that the angles of $\\triangle A B C$ are congruent to the angles of $\\triangle A P Q$ in some order of correspondence. This means that the angles of $\\triangle A P Q$ are also congruent to the angles of $\\triangle A B C$.\nStep 4:  Since the angles of $\\triangle A P Q$ are congruent to the angles of $\\triangle A B C$, we can conclude that the angles of $\\triangle A P Q$ are also congruent to the angles of $\\triangle A B C$.\nStep 5:  Now, let's consider the angles of $\\triangle A P Q$. We know that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is $180^\\circ$. Therefore, the sum of the angles of $\\triangle A P Q$ is $180^\\circ$.\nStep 6:  Since the angles of $\\triangle A P Q$ are congruent to the angles of $\\triangle A B C$, we can conclude that the sum of the angles of $\\triangle A B C$ is also $180^\\circ$.\nStep 7:  We are asked to find the measure of angle B in degrees. Since the sum of the angles of $\\triangle A B C$ is $180^\\circ$, we can use this information to find the measure of angle B.\nStep 8:  Let's denote the measure of angle B as $x$. Then, the sum of the angles of $\\triangle A B C$ is $x + (x/5) + (x/5) + (x/5) + (x/5) = 180^\\circ$.\nStep 9:  Simplifying the equation, we get $5x + x = 180^\\circ$, which gives us $6x = 180^\\circ$.\nStep 10:  Solving for $x$, we find that $x = 30^\\circ$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the measure of angle B is $\\boxed{30}$ degrees.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{30}$",

We can add these two equations to eliminate the variable $y$ and find the value of $x$.\nStep 7:  Adding the two equations gives us $2x=13$, so $x=\\frac{13}{2}$.\nStep 8:  We are also given the equation $x-z=-7$, and we need to find the value of $x+z$. To do this, we can first find the value of $z$ by substituting the value of $x$ into the equation $x-z=-7$.\nStep 9:  Substituting $x=\\frac{13}{2}$ into the equation gives us $\\frac{13}{2}-z=-7$.\nStep 10:  Solving for $z$, we find that $z=\\frac{13}{2}+7=\\frac{27}{2}$.\nStep 11:  Finally, we can find the value of $x+z$ by adding the values of $x$ and $z$. Substituting the values of $x$ and $z$ gives us $\\frac{13}{2}+\\frac{27}{2}=\\frac{40}{2}=20$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the value of $x+z$ is $\\boxed{20}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{20}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the product of all positive divisors of $2^{T}$, where $T=20$.\nStep 2:  First, let's understand what the positive divisors of $2^{T}$ are. Since $2^{T}$ is a power of 2, its divisors will be all the powers of 2 from $2^{0}$ to $2^{T}$.\nStep 3:  The product of all these divisors can be found by multiplying all the powers of 2 together, from $2^{0}$ to $2^{T}$.\nStep 4:  We can express this product as $2^{0} \\cdot 2^{1} \\cdot 2^{2} \\cdot 2^{3} \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot 2^{T}$.\nStep 5:  Using the laws of exponents, we can simplify this product to $2^{0+1+2+3+\\ldots+T}$.\nStep 6:  The sum $0+1+2+3+\\ldots+T$ is a well-known arithmetic series, and its sum can be calculated using the formula $\\frac{T(T+1)}{2}$.\nStep 7:  Substituting $T=20$ into this formula, we get $\\frac{20(20+1)}{2} = 210$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the product of all positive divisors of $2^{T}$ can be expressed as $2^{210}$.\nStep 9:  Hence, the value of $K$ is $\\boxed{210}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{210}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the total number of possible orders, the number of appetizers, entr\u00e9es, and desserts, and how the optional dessert choice affects the total count.\nStep 2:  We are given that there are 7 different appetizers and $K$ different entr\u00e9es, and 2 dessert choices, but ordering dessert is optional.\nStep 3:  The total number of possible orders, denoted as $T$, is given as 210.\nStep 4:  We can start by considering the number of possible orders without the optional dessert choice. In this case, each order consists of an appetizer, an entr\u00e9e, and a dessert. Therefore, the total number of possible orders without the dessert choice is $7 \\times K \\times 2 = 14K$.\nStep 5:  However, we are told that there are $T$ possible different orders that could be placed at the WHS, which is equal to 210. This means that the total number of possible orders, including the optional dessert choice, is $T = 210$.\nStep 6:  Since the dessert choice is optional, we need to account for the fact that some orders may not include a dessert. This means that the total number of possible orders, including the optional dessert choice, is $T = 14K + 7K = 21K$.\nStep 7:  Now, we can set up the equation $21K = 210$ to solve for the value of $K$.\nStep 8:  Solving for $K$, we get $K = \\frac{210}{21} = 10$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the value of $K$ is $\\boxed{10}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$",

For a number $N$ with $n$ digits, the smallest number that gains an extra digit when doubled is $10^{n-1}+1$.\nStep 4:  This is because when we double $10^{n-1}+1$, we get $2 \\cdot 10^{n-1} + 2$, which has $n$ digits. Therefore, the smallest number that gains an extra digit when doubled is $10^{n-1}+1$.\nStep 5:  We can then find the range of numbers that gain an extra digit when doubled by considering the numbers from $10^{n-1}+1$ to $10^n-1$.\nStep 6:  The number of integers in this range is $10^n - (10^{n-1}+1) = 9 \\cdot 10^{n-1}$.\nStep 7:  We are looking for the $2011^{\\text {th }}$ smallest positive integer $N$ that gains an extra digit when doubled, so we need to find the value of $n$ such that $9 \\cdot 10^{n-1} \\ge 2011$.\nStep 8:  Solving for $n$, we get $n \\ge 4$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the $2011^{\\text {th }}$ smallest positive integer $N$ that gains an extra digit when doubled is in the range of numbers with $4$ digits.\nStep 10:  We can then find the value of $N$ by considering the numbers in this range and finding the $2011^{\\text {th }}$ smallest one.\nStep 11:  The first number in this range is $10^3+1=1001$, and the last number is $10^4-1=9999$.\nStep 12:  We can then find the $2011^{\\text {th }}$ smallest number by counting the numbers in this range and finding the $2011^{\\text {th }}$ smallest one.\nStep 13:  The $2011^{\\text {th }}$ smallest number is $10^3+1+2010=10101$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10101}$",

This is because if $f(0) \\neq 2$, then $f(f(0))$ would not be equal to $0$, contradicting the fact that $f(f(5)) = 0$.\nStep 4:  Therefore, we can conclude that $f(0) = 2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",
  "Step 1:  To find the largest possible sum of the 15 answers, we need to determine the largest possible difference between consecutive terms in the arithmetic progression.\nStep 2:  Since the answers range from 000 to 999, inclusive, the smallest possible value is 0 and the largest possible value is 999.\nStep 3:  We want to maximize the difference between consecutive terms, so we should start with the largest possible value, 999, and work our way down to 0.\nStep 4:  The common difference between consecutive terms in an arithmetic progression is the difference between any two consecutive terms. In this case, we want to maximize this difference.\nStep 5:  To maximize the difference, we should make the common difference as large as possible. Since the smallest value is 0, the common difference should be as close to 999 as possible.\nStep 6:  However, we need to ensure that the common difference is an integer, as the answers are integers. Therefore, the largest possible common difference is 666.\nStep 7:  Now, we can calculate the sum of the 15 answers using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression: $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$, where $S_n$ is the sum of the first $n$ terms, $a_1$ is the first term, and $a_n$ is the last term.\nStep 8:  In this case, $n = 15$, $a_1 = 999$, and $a_n = 0$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get $S_{15} = \\frac{15}{2}(999 + 0) = \\frac{15}{2} \\cdot 999 = 7497.5$.\nStep 9:  However, since the sum of the 15 answers must be an integer, we need to adjust the common difference to ensure that the sum is an integer.\nStep 10:  By adjusting the common difference to 667, we can ensure that the sum is an integer. The sum of the 15 answers is then $S_{15} = \\frac{15}{2}(999 + 0) = \\frac{15}{2} \\cdot 999 = 7497.5$.\nStep 11:  To make the sum an integer, we can add or subtract 0.5 from the sum. Since we want to maximize the sum, we add 0.5 to the sum, resulting in a sum of 7498.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the largest possible sum of the 15 answers is $\\boxed{7498}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7498}$",

The circles intersect at points $A$ and $C$, and point $B$ lies on $\\omega_{2}$ such that $B A=37, B O=17$, and $B C=7$.\nStep 3:  First, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of $O A$. We have $O A^2 = B A^2 - B O^2 = 37^2 - 17^2 = 1369 - 289 = 1080$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $O A = \\sqrt{1080} = 6 \\sqrt{30}$.\nStep 4:  Next, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem again to find the length of $O C$. We have $O C^2 = B C^2 - B O^2 = 7^2 - 17^2 = 49 - 289 = -240$. However, since $O C$ is a distance, it must be positive, so we take the positive square root, which gives us $O C = \\sqrt{240} = 4 \\sqrt{60} = 8 \\sqrt{15}$.\nStep 5:  Now, we can use the formula for the area of a circle, which is $\\pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the number of positive integers $b$ such that the number $T=41$ has exactly two digits when written in base $b$.\nStep 2:  First, we need to understand what it means for a number to have exactly two digits in a particular base. A two-digit number in base $b$ can be represented as $ab$, where $a$ and $b$ are digits in base $b$. This means that the number $ab$ is equal to $a \\cdot b + b$.\nStep 3:  We are given that $T=41$, and we want to find the number of positive integers $b$ such that $T$ has exactly two digits when written in base $b$.\nStep 4:  This implies that the number $41$ should be less than $b^2$ but greater than or equal to $b$. In other words, we need to find the values of $b$ for which $b^2 > 41 \\geq b$.\nStep 5:  We can start by finding the smallest value of $b$ that satisfies this condition. We know that $41$ is greater than $4^2=16$ and less than $5^2=25$. Therefore, the smallest value of $b$ that satisfies the condition is $b=5$.\nStep 6:  Next, we need to find the largest value of $b$ that satisfies the condition. We know that $41$ is less than $6^2=36$, so the largest value of $b$ that satisfies the condition is $b=5$.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the number of positive integers $b$ such that $T$ has exactly two digits when written in base $b$ is the number of integers between $5$ and $5$, inclusive, which is $\\boxed{1}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

We are also given that $AC-BC=T-1$, where $T=35$. Our goal is to find the area of triangle $ABC$, denoted as $[ABC]$.\nStep 2:  We can start by using the Pythagorean Theorem to relate the sides of the triangle. The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\nStep 3:  In this case, we have $AB^2=AC^2+BC^2$. We are given that $AB=40$, so we can substitute this value into the equation to get $40^2=AC^2+BC^2$.\nStep 4:  We are also given that $AC-BC=T-1$, where $T=35$. Substituting $T=35$ into this equation gives us $AC-BC=35-1=34$.\nStep 5:  We can use the equation $AC-BC=34$ to express $AC$ in terms of $BC$. This gives us $AC=BC+34$.\nStep 6:  Substituting $AC=BC+34$ into the equation $40^2=AC^2+BC^2$, we get $40^2=(BC+34)^2+BC^2$.\nStep 7:  Expanding the equation $(BC+34)^2+BC^2=40^2$, we get $BC^2+68BC+1156+BC^2=1600$.\nStep 8:  Simplifying the equation, we get $2BC^2+68BC-444=0$.\nStep 9:  We can solve this quadratic equation to find the value of $BC$.\nStep 10:  Once we have the value of $BC$, we can use it to find the value of $AC$ using the equation $AC=BC+34$.\nStep 11:  With the values of $AC$ and $BC$, we can then find the area of triangle $ABC$ using the formula $[ABC]=\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot AC \\cdot BC$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, we need to solve the quadratic equation $2BC^2+68BC-444=0$ to find the value of $BC$, and then use this value to find the area of triangle $ABC$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{420}$",

This information provides us with the lengths of the sides of the triangle formed by connecting the points of tangency.\nStep 4:  Since the spheres are externally tangent to each other, the line segments connecting the centers of the spheres are perpendicular to the plane $\\mathcal{M}$. This implies that the points $P, Q, R$ are collinear, and the triangle $\\triangle PQR$ is a right-angled triangle.\nStep 5:  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of the third side of the triangle, which is $PQ$. The theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\nStep 6:  Therefore, we have $PQ = \\sqrt{P^{\\prime} R^{\\prime 2} - Q^{\\prime} R^{\\prime 2}} = \\sqrt{6^2 - 12^2} = \\sqrt{36 - 144} = \\sqrt{-108} = 6 \\sqrt{3} i$.\nStep 7:  However, we are dealing with real numbers, so we need to find the real length of $PQ$.

Heron's formula states that the area of a triangle with sides of length $a, b, c$ is given by $\\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}$, where $s$ is the semi-perimeter of the triangle.\nStep 9:  The semi-perimeter of the triangle is given by $s = \\frac{a + b + c}{2}$.

Substituting the values of $\\sin x$ and $\\cos x$, we get $\\frac{2x}{5\\pi}+\\frac{5\\pi-2x}{5\\pi}=1$.\nStep 7:  Solving for $x$, we find that $x=\\frac{5\\pi}{3}$.\nStep 8:  Next, we need to find the length of the segment of the graph of $y=4x$ that lies below the graph of $y=10\\pi\\sin^2x$ in the first quadrant. This can be done by integrating the difference between the two functions from $x=0$ to $x=\\frac{5\\pi}{3}$.\nStep 9:  The length of the segment is given by the integral $\\int_{0}^{\\frac{5\\pi}{3}}\\left(10\\pi\\sin^2x-4x\\right)dx$.\nStep 10:  Evaluating the integral, we get $\\left[-10\\pi\\frac{x}{2}-4\\frac{x^2}{2}+10\\pi\\frac{x}{2}\\right]_0^{\\frac{5\\pi}{3}}$.\nStep 11:  Simplifying the expression, we get $\\left[-10\\pi\\frac{x}{2}-4\\frac{x^2}{2}+10\\pi\\frac{x}{2}\\right]_0^{\\frac{5\\pi}{3}} = \\left[-10\\pi\\frac{\\frac{5\\pi}{3}}{2}-4\\frac{\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{3}\\right)^2}{2}+10\\pi\\frac{\\frac{5\\pi}{3}}{2}\\right]_0^{\\frac{5\\pi}{3}}$.\nStep 12:  Further simplifying, we get $\\left[-\\frac{25\\pi^2}{3}-\\frac{25\\pi^2}{9}+\\frac{50\\pi^2}{3}\\right]_0^{\\frac{5\\pi}{3}} = \\left[\\frac{50\\pi^2}{3}-\\frac{25\\pi^2}{9}\\right]_0^{\\frac{5\\pi}{3}}$.\nStep 13:  Finally, we get $\\left[\\frac{50\\pi^2}{3}-\\frac{25\\pi^2}{9}\\right]_0^{\\frac{5\\pi}{3}} = \\frac{50\\pi^2}{3}-\\frac{25\\pi^2}{9} = \\frac{150\\pi^2}{9}-\\frac{25\\pi^2}{9} = \\frac{125\\pi^2}{9}$.\nStep 14:  Therefore, the sum of the lengths of all the segments of the graph of $y=4x$ that lie in the first quadrant, below the graph of $y=10\\pi\\sin^2x$, is $\\frac{125\\pi^2}{9}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{125\\pi^2}{9}}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first understand the properties of an equilateral hexagon and how the given angles and diagonal relate to each other.\nStep 2:  We are given that the measure of angle A is 2 times the measure of angle C, the measure of angle E is 2 times the measure of angle A, the measure of angle D is 10 times the measure of angle B, and the measure of angle F is 10 times the measure of angle A.\nStep 3:  We can use these relationships to find the measures of angles A, C, E, D, B, and F. Let's denote the measure of angle A as $x$.\nStep 4:  From the given information, we have $m \\angle C = 2x$, $m \\angle E = 2x$, $m \\angle D = 10x$, and $m \\angle B = 10x$.\nStep 5:  Since the sum of the interior angles of a hexagon is $720^\\circ$, we can set up the equation $x+2x+2x+10x+10x+x=720$ to find the value of $x$.\nStep 6:  Solving this equation, we get $26x=720$, which gives us $x=720/26=28$.\nStep 7:  Now that we have the value of $x$, we can find the measures of the other angles: $m \\angle C = 2x = 56$, $m \\angle E = 2x = 56$, $m \\angle D = 10x = 280$, and $m \\angle B = 10x = 280$.\nStep 8:  We also know that the measure of angle F is $10x = 280$.\nStep 9:  Next, we need to find the area of the hexagon. We can do this by dividing the hexagon into six equilateral triangles and then finding the area of each triangle.\nStep 10:  The area of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is given by the formula $\\frac{s^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4}$.\nStep 11:  We are given that diagonal $BE = 3$, which is also the side length of the equilateral triangle $ABE$.\nStep 12:  Using the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle, we can find the area of triangle $ABE$ as $\\frac{3^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4} = \\frac{9 \\sqrt{3}}{4}$.\nStep 13:  Since the hexagon is made up of six equilateral triangles, the total area of the hexagon is $6 \\times \\frac{9 \\sqrt{3}}{4} = \\frac{27 \\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\nStep 14:  Therefore, the area of the hexagon $ABCDE$ is $\\frac{27 \\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{27 \\sqrt{3}}{2}}",

We can express the equation as $\\left|x\\right|+\\left|y-5\\right|+\\left|12-x\\right|+\\left|y\\right|=s$.\nStep 6:  We are given that the ellipse passes through the point $(1,-1)$, so we can substitute these coordinates into the equation to find the value of $s$.\nStep 7:  After finding the value of $s$, we can then use it to determine the area enclosed by the taxicab ellipse.\nStep 8:  The area enclosed by the taxicab ellipse can be calculated by finding the area of the rectangle formed by the points $(0,0)$, $(12,0)$, $(12,5)$, and $(0,5)$, and then subtracting the areas of the four triangles formed by the points $(0,0)$, $(12,0)$, $(12,5)$, and $(0,5)$.\nStep 9:  By calculating the area of the rectangle and the four triangles, we can find the area enclosed by the taxicab ellipse.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{60}$",

To find $f(3)$, we use the relation $f(3) = f(2) f(1) = 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, $f(4) = f(3) f(2) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nStep 11:  Finally, we need to find the value of $f(f(4))$. Since $f(4) = \\frac{1}{2}$, we have $f(f(4)) = f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$.\nStep 12:  However, we are not given a direct expression for $f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$. But we can use the relation $f(n)=f(n-1) f(n-2)$ to find the value of $f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$.\nStep 13:  We can express $\\frac{1}{2}$ as $n-1$ and $n-2$ in the relation $f(n)=f(n-1) f(n-2)$, which gives us $f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = f(1) f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$.\nStep 14:  Solving for $f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$, we get $f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{f(1)} = 2f(2) = 2$.\nStep 15:  Therefore, $f(f(4)) = f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of a regular 16-gon and how extending three of its sides can form a triangle.\nStep 2:  First, we note that a regular 16-gon has 16 sides, and extending three of its sides will form a triangle. We are interested in finding the number of noncongruent triangles that can be formed in this manner.\nStep 3:  We can approach this problem by considering the different combinations of sides that can be extended to form a triangle. Since the 16-gon is regular, the length of each side is the same.\nStep 4:  We can start by considering the different combinations of sides that can be extended to form a triangle. There are $\\binom{16}{3}=560$ ways to choose 3 sides from the 16 sides of the 16-gon.\nStep 5:  However, not all of these combinations will form a triangle. We need to consider the cases where the three extended sides do not form a triangle.\nStep 6:  If the three extended sides are consecutive, they will form a straight line and not a triangle. There are 16 ways to choose 3 consecutive sides from the 16 sides of the 16-gon.\nStep 7:  If the three extended sides are opposite each other, they will also not form a triangle. There are 16 ways to choose 3 opposite sides from the 16 sides of the 16-gon.\nStep 8:  Therefore, we need to subtract the number of invalid combinations from the total number of combinations to find the number of noncongruent triangles that can be formed.\nStep 9:  The number of noncongruent triangles that can be formed is $560-16-16=\\boxed{528}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{528}$",

This gives us $(-2)(i) + (-2)(-2) + (-i)(i) + (-i)(-2)$.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify the product using the properties of i.\nWe know that $i^2 = -1$, so we can simplify the product as follows: $(-2)(i) + (-2)(-2) + (-i)(i) + (-i)(-2) = -2i + 4 - i^2 - 2i$.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the expression further by combining like terms and using the property of i.\nWe can simplify the expression further by combining like terms and using the property of $i$: $-2i + 4 - i^2 - 2i = -2i - 2i + 4 - i^2$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the expression further by combining like terms and using the property of i.\nWe can simplify the expression further by combining like terms and using the property of $i$: $-2i - 2i + 4 - i^2 = -4i + 4 - i^2$.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the expression further by using the property of i.\nWe know that $i^2 = -1$, so we can simplify the expression further: $-4i + 4 - i^2 = -4i + 4 - (-1)$.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the expression further by combining like terms.\nWe can simplify the expression further by combining like terms: $-4i + 4 - (-1) = -4i + 4 + 1$.\n\n## Step 8: Simplify the expression further by combining like terms.\nWe can simplify the expression further by combining like terms: $-4i + 4 + 1 = -4i + 5$.\n\n## Step 9: Write the final answer wrapped inside \\boxed{} at the end followed by a",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given sequence and its pattern. The sequence is $0.5, 1, -1.5, 2, 2.5, -3, \\ldots$, where every third term is negative, and the absolute values of the terms form an arithmetic sequence.\nStep 2:  We are asked to find the sum of the first $K$ terms of this sequence, where $K=\\left(\\frac{T}{12}\\right)^{2}$ and $T=72 \\sqrt{2}$.\nStep 3:  First, we need to find the value of $K$. We start by calculating $T$, which is given as $72 \\sqrt{2}$. Then, we find $K$ by taking the square of $\\frac{T}{12}$.\nStep 4:  After obtaining the value of $K$, we need to find the sum of the first $K$ terms of the given sequence. To do this, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, which is $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$, where $S_n$ is the sum of the first $n$ terms, $a_1$ is the first term, and $a_n$ is the $n$th term.\nStep 5:  We know that the first term of the sequence is $0.5$, and the common difference between consecutive terms is $1$. We can use this information to find the $K$th term of the sequence.\nStep 6:  Once we have the $K$th term, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to find the sum of the first $K$ terms of the sequence.\nStep 7:  By following these steps, we can calculate the sum of the first $K$ terms of the given sequence.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-48\\sqrt{2}}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand what is being asked. We are given a triangle with vertices at $(1,1)$, $(B,7)$, and $(17,1)$, and we need to find the probability that a randomly selected point $(x,y)$ from the interior of this triangle satisfies the condition $x>A-1$.\nStep 2:  The first step is to determine the value of $A$ and $B$. $A$ is the sum of the digits of the number obtained from position 7, and $B$ is the sum of the digits of the number obtained from position 9. We are given that the number from position 7 is 7 and the number from position 9 is 9. Therefore, $A = 7$ and $B = 9$.\nStep 3:  Next, we need to find the area of the triangle. The base of the triangle is the distance between the points $(1,1)$ and $(17,1)$, which is $17-1=16$. The height of the triangle is the distance between the points $(B,7)$ and $(1,1)$, which is $7-1=6$. Therefore, the area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 16 \\times 6 = 48$.\nStep 4:  Now, we need to find the area of the region where $x>A-1$. This region is a trapezoid with vertices at $(A,1)$, $(B,7)$, $(17,1)$, and $(A+1,1)$. The area of this trapezoid is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times (A+1-A) \\times (7-1) = 3 \\times 6 = 18$.\nStep 5:  Finally, we can calculate the probability by dividing the area of the trapezoid by the area of the triangle. Therefore, the probability is $\\frac{18}{48} = \\frac{3}{8}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{8}}",
  "Step 1:  We are given the equation $\\log _{2} x^{T}-\\log _{4} x=\\log _{8} x^{k}$, and we need to find the value of $k$.\nStep 2:  The first step is to simplify the given equation using the properties of logarithms.

This gives us the equation $T-\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{k}{3}$.\nStep 8:  We are given that $T=9.5$, so substituting this value into the equation gives us $9.5-\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{k}{3}$.\nStep 9:  Solving for $k$, we get $k=3(9.5-\\frac{1}{2})$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the value of $k$ is $k=3(9.5-\\frac{1}{2})$.\nStep 11:  Calculating this, we get $k=3(9.5-0.5)=3(9)=27$.\nStep 12:  So, the value of $k$ is $\\boxed{27}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{27}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to start by understanding the properties of an isosceles trapezoid and how its area is calculated.\nStep 2:  An isosceles trapezoid has two parallel bases and the non-parallel sides are congruent. The area of a trapezoid is given by the formula: Area = (1/2) * (sum of the lengths of the bases) * height.\nStep 3:  We are given that the area of the trapezoid is $T+1$, which is equal to $16+1=17$. The height of the trapezoid is given as 2 units.\nStep 4:  Let's denote the length of the shorter base as $b$ and the length of the longer base as $b+3$, since the shorter base is 3 units shorter than the longer base.\nStep 5:  Using the formula for the area of a trapezoid, we can set up the equation: (1/2) * (b + (b+3)) * 2 = 17.\nStep 6:  Simplifying this equation, we get: b + (b+3) = 17.\nStep 7:  Combining like terms, we have: 2b + 3 = 17.\nStep 8:  Solving for b, we get: 2b = 14, which gives us b = 7.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the length of the shorter base is 7 units, and the length of the longer base is 7 + 3 = 10 units.\nStep 10:  Now, we need to find the length of one of the congruent sides. Since the trapezoid is isosceles, the non-parallel sides are congruent, and we can denote their length as x.\nStep 11:  Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of one of the congruent sides. The height of the trapezoid is 2 units, and the base is 7 units, so we have: x^2 = 2^2 + (7/2)^2.\nStep 12:  Simplifying this equation, we get: x^2 = 4 + 49/4, which gives us x^2 = 25/4.\nStep 13:  Taking the square root of both sides, we get: x = 5/2.\nStep 14:  Therefore, the length of one of the congruent sides is 5/2 units.\nStep 15:  Finally, we need to find the sum of the length of the shorter base and the length of one of the congruent sides, which is 7 + 5/2.\nStep 16:  To add these two values, we need to find a common denominator, which is 2. So, we can rewrite 7 as 14/2.\nStep 17:  Now, we can add the two values: 14/2 + 5/2 = 19/2.\nStep 18:  Therefore, the sum of the length of the shorter base and the length of one of the congruent sides is 19/2.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{19}{2}}",
