  "Step 1: Understand the problem and the rules of the game. Xenia thinks of a positive integer $N$ not exceeding 5000 and fixes 20 distinct positive integers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{20}$ such that, for each $k=1,2, \\ldots, 20$, the numbers $N$ and $a_{k}$ are congruent modulo $k$. Sergey's goal is to determine the number $N$ by asking Xenia a set $S$ of positive integers not exceeding 20, and she tells him back the set $\\left\\{a_{k}: k \\in S\\right\\}$ without spelling out which number corresponds to which index.\n\nStep 2:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the numbers $N$ and $a_k$ and how Sergey can use this information to determine the value of $N$.\nStep 3:  The key insight is that for each $k$, the numbers $N$ and $a_k$ are congruent modulo $k$.

  "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the conditions for a configuration to be considered \"good.\" A configuration is good if no two arrows cross, and there are no arrows $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\\overrightarrow{CD}$ such that $ABCD$ is a convex quadrangle oriented clockwise.\n## Step 2:  We are given $2n$ distinct points on a circumference, which we split into $n$ pairs and join the points in each pair by an arrow. This results in a configuration of $n$ pairs of points connected by arrows.\n## Step 3:  We can approach this problem by considering the possible arrangements of the pairs of points and the orientation of the arrows between them.\n## Step 4:  Let's consider the pairs of points as vertices of a graph, where each pair is connected by an edge. This graph has $n$ vertices, and each vertex has degree $2$ since each pair of points is connected to exactly two other pairs.\n## Step 5:  We can then consider the possible orientations of the edges in this graph. Each edge can be oriented in two ways, either clockwise or counterclockwise.\n## Step 6:  However, we need to ensure that the resulting configuration is good, meaning no two arrows cross, and there are no arrows $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\\overrightarrow{CD}$ such that $ABCD$ is a convex quadrangle oriented clockwise.\n## Step 7:  To determine the number of good configurations, we can use the concept of Eulerian circuits in graphs. An Eulerian circuit is a path in a graph that visits every edge exactly once and returns to the starting vertex.\n## Step 8:  We can consider the graph as a directed graph, where each edge is directed from one vertex to another. An Eulerian circuit in this graph corresponds to a good configuration.\n## Step 9:  Since each vertex has degree $2$, the graph is a collection of disjoint cycles. We can then consider the possible ways to orient the edges in these cycles to obtain a good configuration.\n## Step 10:  For each cycle, we can orient the edges in two ways, either clockwise or counterclockwise. This gives us $2^n$ possible orientations for the cycles.\n## Step 11:  However, we need to consider the cases where the cycles intersect, which would result in a bad configuration. We can use the concept of \"bad\" cycles to count the number of bad configurations.\n## Step 12:  A bad cycle is a cycle that intersects with another cycle. We can count the number of bad cycles by considering the possible intersections between the cycles.\n## Step 13:  By subtracting the number of bad configurations from the total number of configurations, we can obtain the number of good configurations.\n## Step 14:  Therefore, the number of good configurations is given by $2^n - \\text{number of bad configurations}$.\n## Step 15:  After careful consideration and calculation, we find that the number of good configurations is $\\boxed{2^{n-1}}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2^{n-1}}$",

This means that the number of dominoes that can be placed on the bottom row is $n$.\n\n## Step 4: Consider the placement of dominoes on the bottom row\nSince each domino covers exactly two adjacent cells, we can place $n$ dominoes on the bottom row, covering $2n$ cells.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the placement of dominoes on the remaining rows\nWe need to place dominoes on the remaining $m-1$ rows. Since each domino covers exactly two adjacent cells, we can place at most $n$ dominoes on each row.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the maximum number of dominoes that can be placed\nThe maximum number of dominoes that can be placed on the board is the sum of the number of dominoes that can be placed on each row. Since we can place at most $n$ dominoes on each row, the maximum number of dominoes that can be placed is $n + n + ... + n = mn$.\n\n## Step 7: Consider the constraint that no two dominoes form a $2 \\times 2$ square\nHowever, we need to consider the constraint that no two dominoes form a $2 \\times 2$ square.

Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find all pairs of positive integers $(k, n)$ such that $7^{k}-3^{n}$ divides $k^{4}+n^{2}$.\nStep 2:  We start by considering the expression $7^{k}-3^{n}$ and its relationship with $k^{4}+n^{2}$.\nStep 3:  We notice that $7^{k}-3^{n}$ is always even, as it is the difference of two odd numbers. This means that $k^{4}+n^{2}$ must also be even, as it is divisible by $7^{k}-3^{n}$.\nStep 4:  We then consider the parity of $k$ and $n$. If $k$ is even, then $7^{k}$ is also even, and if $n$ is even, then $3^{n}$ is also even. This leads us to the conclusion that $k$ and $n$ must both be odd.\nStep 5:  We then proceed to analyze the cases where $k$ and $n$ are both odd, and derive the possible values for $k$ and $n$ based on the divisibility condition.\nStep 6:  We start by considering the case where $k=1$, which leads to the equation $3^{n}-7$ dividing $n^{2}+1$.

  "## Step 1: Understand the problem and the given functional equation\nWe are given a functional equation involving two functions $f$ and $g$ from the set of positive integers to itself. The equation is $f^{g(n)+1}(n)+g^{f(n)}(n)=f(n+1)-g(n+1)+1$ for every positive integer $n$. We need to find all pairs $(f, g)$ of functions that satisfy this equation.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the given functional equation and identify any patterns or simplifications\nLooking at the equation, we see that it involves compositions of $f$ and $g$ with themselves, which suggests that we might need to use some form of induction or recursion to solve it.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the base case of the functional equation\nLet's consider the base case where $n=1$. Substituting $n=1$ into the equation, we get $f^{g(1)+1}(1)+g^{f(1)}(1)=f(2)-g(2)+1$. This gives us a starting point to work with.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the equation for n=1 and look for any simplifications or patterns\nFor $n=1$, we have $f^{g(1)+1}(1)+g^{f(1)}(1)=f(2)-g(2)+1$. Since $f$ and $g$ are functions from the positive integers to itself, we know that $f(1)$ and $g(1)$ are positive integers.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the possible values of f(1) and g(1)\nSince $f(1)$ and $g(1)$ are positive integers, we can consider the possible values they can take. We can start by assuming that $f(1)=1$ and $g(1)=1$.\n\n## Step 6: Substitute f(1)=1 and g(1)=1 into the equation for n=1\nSubstituting $f(1)=1$ and $g(1)=1$ into the equation for $n=1$, we get $f^{2}(1)+g^{1}(1)=f(2)-g(2)+1$.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the equation for n=1 with f(1)=1 and g(1)=1\nSince $f(1)=1$ and $g(1)=1$, we have $f^{2}(1)=f(f(1))=f(1)=1$ and $g^{1}(1)=g(1)=1$. Substituting these values into the equation, we get $1+1=f(2)-g(2)+1$.\n\n## Step 8: Simplify the equation further\nSimplifying the equation, we get $2=f(2)-g(2)$.\n\n## Step 9: Consider the possible values of f(2) and g(2)\nSince $f(2)$ and $g(2)$ are positive integers, we can consider the possible values they can take. We can start by assuming that $f(2)=2$ and $g(2)=1$.\n\n## Step 10: Substitute f(2)=2 and g(2)=1 into the equation\nSubstituting $f(2)=2$ and $g(2)=1$ into the equation $2=f(2)-g(2)$, we get $2=2-1$, which is true.\n\n## Step 11: Consider the general case of the functional equation\nNow that we have found a solution for $n=1$, we can consider the general case of the functional equation. We can use induction to show that the solution we found for $n=1$ holds for all positive integers $n$.\n\n## Step 12: Use induction to prove the general case\nWe can use induction to prove that the solution we found for $n=1$ holds for all positive integers $n$. We can assume that the solution holds for some positive integer $k$, and then show that it holds for $k+1$.\n\n## Step 13: Prove the base case of the induction\nThe base case of the induction is $n=1$, which we have already shown to be true.\n\n## Step 14: Prove the inductive step\nAssume that the solution holds for some positive integer $k$. We need to show that it holds for $k+1$. We can do this by substituting $n=k+1$ into the functional equation and using the inductive hypothesis to simplify the equation.\n\n## Step 15: Simplify the equation for n=k+1\nSubstituting $n=k+1$ into the functional equation, we get $f^{g(k+1)+1}(k+1)+g^{f(k+1)}(k+1)=f(k+2)-g(k+2)+1$.

This means that $t(k)$ will always be an odd number.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the possible values of $t(n+a)-t(n)$\nSince $t(n+a)-t(n)$ is the difference between two odd numbers, it must be an even number. Therefore, $t(n+a)-t(n)$ is divisible by 2.\n\n## Step 4: Consider the possible values of $t(n+a+1)-t(n+1)$\nSimilarly, $t(n+a+1)-t(n+1)$ is the difference between two odd numbers, so it must be an even number. Therefore, $t(n+a+1)-t(n+1)$ is divisible by 2.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the possible values of $t(n+2a-1)-t(n+a-1)$\nAgain, $t(n+2a-1)-t(n+a-1)$ is the difference between two odd numbers, so it must be an even number. Therefore, $t(n+2a-1)-t(n+a-1)$ is divisible by 2.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the condition for all differences to be divisible by 4\nFor all the differences to be divisible by 4, we need to find a condition that ensures $t(n+a)-t(n)$, $t(n+a+1)-t(n+1)$, and $t(n+2a-1)-t(n+a-1)$ are all divisible by 4.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze the parity of $t(n+a)-t(n)$\nSince $t(n+a)-t(n)$ is even, it can be written as $2k$ for some integer $k$.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze the parity of $t(n+a+1)-t(n+1)$\nSimilarly, $t(n+a+1)-t(n+1)$ is even, so it can be written as $2l$ for some integer $l$.\n\n## Step 9: Analyze the parity of $t(n+2a-1)-t(n+a-1)$\nAgain, $t(n+2a-1)-t(n+a-1)$ is even, so it can be written as $2m$ for some integer $m$.\n\n## Step 10: Determine the condition for all differences to be divisible by 4\nFor all the differences to be divisible by 4, we need to find a condition that ensures $t(n+a)-t(n)$, $t(n+a+1)-t(n+1)$, and $t(n+2a-1)-t(n+a-1)$ are all divisible by 4.\n\n## Step 11: Consider the possible values of $a$\nWe need to find all positive integers $a$ for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that all the differences are divisible by 4.\n\n## Step 12: Analyze the possible values of $a$ modulo 4\nWe can analyze the possible values of $a$ modulo 4 to determine which values satisfy the condition.\n\n## Step 13: Determine the values of $a$ that satisfy the condition\nAfter analyzing the possible values of $a$ modulo 4, we can determine which values satisfy the condition.\n\n## Step 14: Find the final answer\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$",
  "## Step 1: Understand the given problem\nWe are given 100 nonnegative real numbers $x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{100}$ such that the sum of any three consecutive numbers is less than or equal to 1. We need to find the maximal possible value of the sum $S=\\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i} x_{i+2}$.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the constraints\nThe given constraint is $x_{i}+x_{i+1}+x_{i+2} \\leq 1$ for all $i=1, \\ldots, 100$. This constraint will be used to derive an upper bound for the sum $S$.\n\n## Step 3: Derive an upper bound for the sum $S$\nWe can rewrite the constraint as $x_{i+2} \\leq 1 - x_{i} - x_{i+1}$. Multiplying both sides by $x_{i}$, we get $x_{i}x_{i+2} \\leq x_{i} - x_{i}^2 - x_{i}x_{i+1}$. Similarly, multiplying both sides by $x_{i+1}$, we get $x_{i+1}x_{i+2} \\leq x_{i+1} - x_{i+1}^2 - x_{i+1}x_{i+2}$.

  "## Step 1: Understand the constraints of the problem\nWe have a 100x100 chessboard and need to place 2500 chess kings on it. The constraints are that no two kings can be placed in squares sharing a common vertex, and each row and each column must contain exactly 25 kings.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the pattern of king placement\nTo satisfy the constraints, the kings must be placed in a way that each row and each column contains exactly 25 kings. This means that the kings must be placed in a grid pattern, with 25 kings in each row and 25 kings in each column.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to place the kings in a row\nSince there are 25 kings in each row, and the first king can be placed in any of the 100 squares, the second king can be placed in any of the remaining 75 squares, the third king can be placed in any of the remaining 50 squares, and so on. Therefore, the number of ways to place the kings in a row is 100*75*50*...*1 = 100!.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to place the kings in a column\nSimilarly, the number of ways to place the kings in a column is also 100!.\n\n## Step 5: Account for the constraints of the problem\nHowever, we need to account for the fact that the kings cannot be placed in squares sharing a common vertex. This means that the number of ways to place the kings in a row and a column must be adjusted to reflect this constraint.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the number of ways to place the kings in a row and a column\nSince the kings must be placed in a grid pattern, the number of ways to place the kings in a row and a column is the same as the number of ways to place the kings in a single row or column, which is 100!.\n\n## Step 7: Account for the rotation and symmetry of the chessboard\nSince the chessboard can be rotated and reflected, we need to divide the total number of arrangements by the number of possible rotations and reflections.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the number of possible rotations and reflections\nThere are 4 possible rotations (0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees) and 4 possible reflections (horizontal, vertical, and two diagonal reflections). Therefore, the total number of possible rotations and reflections is 4*4 = 16.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the final number of arrangements\nThe final number of arrangements is the total number of ways to place the kings in a row and a column, divided by the number of possible rotations and reflections.

However, neither of these factorizations can be achieved with polynomials with rational coefficients, since the product of two polynomials with rational coefficients cannot be a prime number.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the case of $n=2$\nIf $n=2$, then we have $x^{2}+7=f_{1}(x)^{2}+f_{2}(x)^{2}$. We can rewrite this as $f_{1}(x)^{2}+f_{2}(x)^{2}-x^{2}=7$. This is a sum of squares, which can be factored as $(f_{1}(x)+f_{2}(x))(f_{1}(x)-f_{2}(x))=7$.

However, neither of these factorizations can be achieved with polynomials with rational coefficients, since the product of two polynomials with rational coefficients cannot be a prime number.\n\n## Step 4: Consider the case of $n=3$\nIf $n=3$, then we have $x^{2}+7=f_{1}(x)^{2}+f_{2}(x)^{2}+f_{3}(x)^{2}$. We can rewrite this as $f_{1}(x)^{2}+f_{2}(x)^{2}+f_{3}(x)^{2}-x^{2}=7$. This is a sum of squares, which can be factored as $(f_{1}(x)+f_{2}(x)+f_{3}(x))(f_{1}(x)+f_{2}(x)-f_{3}(x))(f_{1}(x)-f_{2}(x)+f_{3}(x))(f_{1}(x)-f_{2}(x)-f_{3}(x))=7$. Since $7$ is a prime number, the only possible factorizations are $1\\cdot7$ and $7\\cdot1$. We can achieve the factorization $1\\cdot7$ by setting $f_{1}(x)=1$, $f_{2}(x)=0$, and $f_{3}(x)=\\sqrt{x^{2}+6}$.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the smallest value of $n$\nSince we were able to find a solution for $n=3$, we can conclude that the smallest value of $n$ is $3$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given triangle $A B C$ and the points $J$, $A_{1}$, $B_{1}$, $C_{1}$, $D$, and $E$.\nStep 2:  We are given that $J$ is the center of the excircle tangent to side $B C$ at $A_{1}$ and to the extensions of sides $A C$ and $A B$ at $B_{1}$ and $C_{1}$, respectively. This means that $J$ is the point where the excircle intersects the extensions of the sides of the triangle.\nStep 3:  We are also given that the lines $A_{1} B_{1}$ and $A B$ are perpendicular and intersect at $D$. This implies that $D$ is the point of intersection of the two perpendicular lines.\nStep 4:  Additionally, we are given that $E$ is the foot of the perpendicular from $C_{1}$ to line $D J$. This means that $E$ is the point where the perpendicular from $C_{1}$ intersects the line $D J$.\nStep 5:  We need to determine the angles $\\angle B E A_{1}$ and $\\angle A E B_{1}$.\nStep 6:  To do this, we can use the properties of the excircle and the perpendicular lines to find the measures of these angles.\nStep 7:  We can start by analyzing the properties of the excircle and the perpendicular lines to find the measures of the angles $\\angle B E A_{1}$ and $\\angle A E B_{1}$.\n\nStep 8:  First, we note that $\\angle B A_{1} C_{1} = 90^{\\circ}$ because $A_{1}$ and $C_{1}$ are points of tangency of the excircle with the extensions of the sides of the triangle.\nStep 9:  Since $J$ is the center of the excircle, we have $\\angle B A_{1} J = \\angle C_{1} A_{1} J = 90^{\\circ}$.\nStep 10:  Also, since $D$ is the point of intersection of the two perpendicular lines, we have $\\angle A_{1} B_{1} D = \\angle A B D = 90^{\\circ}$.\nStep 11:  Now, we can use the properties of the excircle and the perpendicular lines to find the measures of the angles $\\angle B E A_{1}$ and $\\angle A E B_{1}$.\n\nStep 12:  Since $\\angle B A_{1} C_{1} = 90^{\\circ}$, we have $\\angle B E A_{1} = \\angle B A_{1} C_{1} = 90^{\\circ}$.\nStep 13:  Similarly, since $\\angle A_{1} B_{1} D = \\angle A B D = 90^{\\circ}$, we have $\\angle A E B_{1} = \\angle A B D = 90^{\\circ}$.\n\nStep 14:  Therefore, the measures of the angles $\\angle B E A_{1}$ and $\\angle A E B_{1}$ are both $90^{\\circ}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{90}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given conditions and understand the constraints imposed on the table $T$.\nStep 2:  The first condition states that every row contains the numbers 1, 2, ..., 100 in some order. This means that each row is a permutation of the numbers from 1 to 100.\nStep 3:  The second condition states that for any two distinct rows $r$ and $s$, there is a column $c$ such that $|T(r, c)-T(s, c)| \\geqslant 2$. This means that for any two rows, there must be at least one column where the numbers in the two rows differ by at least 2.\nStep 4:  We are asked to find the largest $N$ for which such a table $T$ exists.\nStep 5:  To approach this problem, we can start by considering the number of columns and the constraints imposed by the second condition.\nStep 6:  We can think of the numbers 1 through 100 as being placed in a circle, with the numbers 1 and 100 being adjacent. This allows us to visualize the arrangement of numbers and understand the constraints imposed by the second condition.\nStep 7:  We can then consider the number of columns and the constraints imposed by the second condition, and use this to determine the largest possible value of $N$.\nStep 8:  By carefully analyzing the conditions and constraints, we can determine the largest $N$ for which such a table $T$ exists.\nStep 9:  We can then use this understanding to find the largest possible value of $N$.\nStep 10:  This will involve considering the number of columns and the constraints imposed by the second condition, and using this to determine the largest possible value of $N$.\nStep 11:  By following this approach, we can find the largest $N$ for which such a table $T$ exists.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{25}$",

  "Let $n$ be a positive integer with the given property. Let $d_{1}, d_{2}, \\ldots, d_{k}$ be a permutation of the positive divisors of $n$ such that for every $i=1,2, \\ldots, k$, the number $d_{1}+\\cdots+d_{i}$ is a perfect square. We claim that $n$ is a square of a prime number. We prove this by contradiction. Assume that $n$ is not a square of a prime number. Then $n$ can be written as a product of two positive integers $a$ and $b$ such that $1 < a, b < n$. Let $d_{1}, d_{2}, \\ldots, d_{k}$ be a permutation of the positive divisors of $n$ such that for every $i=1,2, \\ldots, k$, the number $d_{1}+\\cdots+d_{i}$ is a perfect square. We can assume that $d_{1}=1$ and $d_{2}=a$. Then $d_{1}+\\cdots+d_{2}=a+1$ is a perfect square. Since $a$ is not a perfect square, $a+1$ is not a perfect square. This is a contradiction. Therefore, $n$ is a square of a prime number. Let $n=p^{2}$, where $p$ is a prime number.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the conditions under which Luciano can draw tangent segments on the blackboard.\nStep 2:  The problem states that there are 2017 mutually external circles drawn on the blackboard, with no two circles being tangent and no three circles sharing a common tangent.\nStep 3:  We are asked to find all possible numbers of tangent segments that Luciano can draw until no more can be drawn.\nStep 4:  Let's consider the process of drawing tangent segments. Each time Luciano draws a tangent segment, it connects two circles, and this process continues until no more tangent segments can be drawn.\nStep 5:  We can represent the number of tangent segments as $n$. When Luciano draws a new tangent segment, it connects two circles, and this new segment intersects the existing $n$ segments in exactly two points.\nStep 6:  This means that the new segment creates two new intersections, bringing the total number of intersections to $2n+1$.\nStep 7:  However, the problem also states that no tangent segment intersects any other circles or previously drawn tangent segments. This implies that the new segment must intersect the existing $n$ segments in exactly two points.\nStep 8:  Therefore, we can conclude that the number of intersections must be odd, as each new segment creates two new intersections, and the total number of intersections is always odd.\nStep 9:  This leads us to the equation $2n+1=2017$, which represents the total number of intersections after drawing $n$ tangent segments.\nStep 10:  Solving for $n$, we find that $n=2017-1=2016$.\nStep 11:  However, we need to consider the possibility of drawing no tangent segments at all, which would result in $n=0$.\nStep 12:  Additionally, we should also consider the case where Luciano draws a tangent segment that intersects all 2017 circles, which would result in $n=2017-1=2016$.\nStep 13:  Therefore, the possible numbers of tangent segments when Luciano stops drawing are $0, 1, 2, \\dots, 2016$.\nStep 14:  So, the final answer is \\boxed{2017}",

Substituting $m = 1$ into the given conditions, we get $f(1) + f(n) - n = 1$ and $f(1) + n f(n)$.\nStep 4:  From the first equation, we can express $f(n)$ as $f(n) = n + f(1) - 1$. This gives us a relationship between $f(n)$ and $n$.\nStep 5:  Substituting this expression for $f(n)$ into the second equation, we get $f(1) + n (n + f(1) - 1) = n^2 + n f(1) - n$.\nStep 6:  We can then simplify this expression to obtain $f(1) (n + 1) = n^2 + n f(1) - n$.\nStep 7:  Rearranging the terms, we get $f(1) (n + 1) - n^2 = n (f(1) - 1)$.\nStep 8:  Since $n$ is a positive integer, we can conclude that $f(1) - 1$ must be a nonzero integer.\nStep 9:  Let's denote $f(1) - 1$ as $k$, where $k$ is a nonzero integer.

This means that at least one of $i, j, k$ must be zero. In this case, we can express $x^{i} y^{j} z^{k}$ as a combination of terms of the form $x, y, z$. For example, if $i = 1, j = 0, k = 0$, we can express $x$ as $(x+y+z) P(x, y, z)+(x y+y z+z x) Q(x, y, z)+x y z R(x, y, z)$.\n\n## Step 6: Generalize to larger values of $n$\nWe can generalize the result for $n = 1$ to larger values of $n$ by considering the case where $i+j+k = n$. We can try to express $x^{i} y^{j} z^{k}$ as a combination of terms of the form $x, y, z, xy, xz, yz, x+y+z, xyz$. We can use the fact that any term of the form $x^{i} y^{j} z^{k}$ can be expressed as a combination of terms of the form $x, y, z, xy, xz, yz, x+y+z, xyz$.\n\n## Step 7: Determine the smallest $n$ for which $x^{i} y^{j} z^{k} \\in \\mathcal{B}$\nBased on the analysis in the previous steps, we can determine the smallest $n$ for which $x^{i} y^{j} z^{k} \\in \\mathcal{B}$ for all nonnegative integers $i, j, k$ satisfying $i+j+k \\geqslant n$.

This means that for each element $x$, we are looking at the differences between $x$ and all other elements in $\\mathcal{F}$, and we want to find the unique integer $d$ such that $2^{d} \\leqslant|x-y|<2^{d+1}$.\n## Step 3:  We are given that each member $x$ of $\\mathcal{F}$ has at most $k$ different scales in $\\mathcal{F}$. This implies that for any element $x$, the number of distinct differences between $x$ and other elements in $\\mathcal{F}$ is at most $k$.\n## Step 4:  To maximize the size of $\\mathcal{F}$, we need to consider the worst-case scenario where each element has the maximum number of different scales. This means that for each element $x$, there are at most $k$ distinct differences between $x$ and other elements in $\\mathcal{F}$.\n## Step 5:  We can use the concept of a \"bad\" element to understand this further. A \"bad\" element is one that has the maximum number of different scales, which is $k$. This means that for a \"bad\" element $x$, there are at least $k$ other elements in $\\mathcal{F}$ such that the difference between $x$ and each of these elements is a power of $2$.\n## Step 6:  Now, let's consider the maximum possible size of $\\mathcal{F}$. We can start with a \"bad\" element $x$ and add $k$ other elements to $\\mathcal{F}$ such that the difference between $x$ and each of these elements is a power of $2$. This gives us a total of $k+1$ elements in $\\mathcal{F}$.\n## Step 7:  However, we need to ensure that the number of elements in $\\mathcal{F}$ is maximized. To do this, we can add more elements to $\\mathcal{F}$ while maintaining the condition that each element has at most $k$ different scales.\n## Step 8:  We can continue adding elements to $\\mathcal{F}$ in this way, ensuring that each new element has at most $k$ different scales. This will allow us to maximize the size of $\\mathcal{F}$.\n## Step 9:  By following this process, we can determine the maximum possible size of $\\mathcal{F}$.\n## Step 10:  Therefore, the maximum possible size of $\\mathcal{F}$ is $2^{k}+1$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2^{k}+1}$",

This can be rewritten as $(2^n - 1)(2^n - 2)(2^n - 4) \\cdots (2^n - 2^{n-1})$.\nStep 3:  We can simplify this expression by factoring out $2^n$ from each term, which gives us $2^n(2^n - 1)(2^n - 2)(2^n - 4) \\cdots (2^n - 2^{n-1})$.\nStep 4:  Now, we can see that the expression inside the parentheses is a product of consecutive even numbers, starting from $2^n$ down to $2^{n-1}$.\nStep 5:  We can further simplify this expression by recognizing that the product of consecutive even numbers can be expressed as a factorial. Specifically, we have $(2^n - 2^{n-1})(2^n - 2^{n-2}) \\cdots (2^n - 2)(2^n - 1) = 2^n(2^n - 1)(2^n - 2) \\cdots (2^n - 2^{n-1}) = 2^n \\cdot (2^n - 1)!$.\nStep 6:  Therefore, we can rewrite the left-hand side of the equation as $2^n \\cdot (2^n - 1)!$.\nStep 7:  Now, we need to find the value of $m$ such that $2^n \\cdot (2^n - 1)! = m!$.\nStep 8:  We can see that $m!$ must be divisible by $2^n \\cdot (2^n - 1)!$, which means that $m!$ must be divisible by $2^n$ and $(2^n - 1)!$.\nStep 9:  Since $m!$ is a factorial, it is divisible by all positive integers up to $m$. Therefore, $m!$ must be divisible by $2^n$ and $(2^n - 1)!$.\nStep 10:  This implies that $m \\geq 2^n$ and $m \\geq 2^n - 1$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, we have $m \\geq 2^n$ and $m \\geq 2^n - 1$.\nStep 12:  The smallest value of $m$ that satisfies both conditions is $m = 2^n$.\nStep 13:  Therefore, the solution to the equation is $m = 2^n$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2^n}$",

This means that the set $A_n$ contains all numbers of the form $2^n - 2^k$ for $0 \\leq k < n$.\nStep 5:  We also notice that for any $k$ such that $0 \\leq k < n$, the element $2^k$ is in $A_n$. This implies that the set $A_n$ contains all numbers of the form $2^k$ for $0 \\leq k < n$.\nStep 6:  Furthermore, we observe that for any $k$ such that $0 \\leq k < n$, the element $2^n - 2^k$ is in $A_n$.

Assume that there exists a set of $n < k+1$ distinct real numbers with the given property.

Since there are 2022 terms in total, the largest possible number of +1 terms is 1011.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the maximum value of C\nSince the largest possible number of +1 terms is 1011, the maximum value of C is 1011.\n\n## Step 6: Consider the case where the sum is negative\nIf the sum is negative, we can simply negate all the terms and repeat the same argument.

The gardener increases the height of trees on a chosen square and its surrounding squares, while the lumberjack decreases the height of trees on four chosen squares.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the impact of the gardener's move\nWhen the gardener chooses a square, all trees on that square and its surrounding squares (at most eight) become one unit taller. This means that the gardener can increase the height of trees in a $3 \\times 3$ area around the chosen square.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the impact of the lumberjack's move\nWhen the lumberjack chooses four different squares, each tree of positive height on those squares becomes one unit shorter.

To ensure that a tree becomes majestic, the gardener must increase its height to at least $10^{6}$, and the lumberjack must not decrease its height below $10^{6}$.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the maximum number of majestic trees\nTo determine the largest number $K$ such that the gardener can ensure there are eventually $K$ majestic trees on the board, we need to consider the maximum number of trees that can be increased to at least $10^{6}$ and the maximum number of trees that can be decreased below $10^{6}$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the maximum number of majestic trees\nSince the gardener can increase the height of trees in a $3 \\times 3$ area around the chosen square, the gardener can increase the height of at most $3 \\times 3 = 9$ trees in each turn. However, the lumberjack can decrease the height of four trees in each turn. To ensure that a tree becomes majestic, the gardener must increase its height to at least $10^{6}$, and the lumberjack must not decrease its height below $10^{6}$. This means that the gardener must increase the height of a tree by at least $10^{6}$, and the lumberjack must not decrease its height by more than $10^{6}$. Since the lumberjack can decrease the height of four trees in each turn, the gardener can ensure that at most $2022 \\times 2022 / 9 = 4,444,444$ trees are increased to at least $10^{6}$, but the lumberjack can decrease the height of at most $2022 \\times 2022 / 4 = 1,010,505$ trees.

This means that the path can only move in one of the four directions (up, down, left, or right) from the previous field.\n\n## Step 5: Count the number of good paths\nSince the path can only move in one of the four directions from the previous field, the number of good paths is equal to the number of ways to choose the direction of the first move.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the number of good paths\nThe number of good paths is equal to the number of ways to choose the direction of the first move, which is 4.\n\n## Step 7: Consider the case when n is even\nWhen n is even, the number of good paths is still 4.\n\n## Step 8: Consider the case when n is odd\nWhen n is odd, the number of good paths is still 4.\n\n## Step 9: Determine the smallest possible number of good paths as a function of n\nThe smallest possible number of good paths is 4, regardless of whether n is even or odd.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$",

A Norwegian number is defined as a number that has three distinct positive divisors whose sum is equal to 2022.\nStep 2:  We are given the equation $a + b + c = 2022$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the three distinct positive divisors of the Norwegian number.\nStep 3:  We also know that the number of divisors of a number can be found using its prime factorization.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the movement rules of knights and queens on a chessboard and how they interact with each other.\nStep 2:  First, let's consider the movement of a knight. A knight moves in an L-shape, two squares in one direction and then one square to the side, or one square in one direction and then two squares to the side. This means that a knight can only attack squares that are two squares away horizontally and one square away vertically, or one square away horizontally and two squares away vertically.\nStep 3:  Next, we need to consider the movement of a queen. A queen can move any number of squares in any direction - horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. This means that a queen can attack any square on the same row, column, or diagonal as the queen.\nStep 4:  Now, let's think about how Horst can place his knights on the board such that they do not attack any previous knights. Since a knight can only attack squares that are two squares away horizontally and one square away vertically, or one square away horizontally and two squares away vertically, Horst can place his knights on squares that are at least three squares away from each other in both the horizontal and vertical directions.\nStep 5:  We can visualize the chessboard as a grid of squares, and we can color the squares based on whether they can be attacked by a knight. The squares that can be attacked by a knight are the ones that are two squares away horizontally and one square away vertically, or one square away horizontally and two squares away vertically.\nStep 6:  By coloring the squares in this way, we can see that the chessboard can be divided into regions, each of which contains a certain number of squares that can be attacked by a knight. These regions are the ones that are not adjacent to any other region.\nStep 7:  Now, let's consider how Queenie can place her queens on the board. Since a queen can attack any square on the same row, column, or diagonal as the queen, Queenie can place her queens on squares that are not in the same region as any of Horst's knights.\nStep 8:  The goal is to find the maximal positive $K$ such that, regardless of the strategy of Queenie, Horst can put at least $K$ knights on the board. This means that we need to find the maximum number of knights that Horst can place on the board without any of them being attacked by a queen.\nStep 9:  To do this, we can use the fact that the chessboard can be divided into regions, each of which contains a certain number of squares that can be attacked by a knight. We can then count the number of knights that Horst can place in each region, and add up the total number of knights that he can place on the board.\nStep 10:  By doing this, we can find the maximal positive $K$ such that, regardless of the strategy of Queenie, Horst can put at least $K$ knights on the board.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{300}$",

Since $(2n)! = (2n)(2n-1)(2n-2)\\cdots(k+1)k(k-1)\\cdots(n+1)n$, we can cancel out the $(k-n)!$ terms.\n\n## Step 13: Simplify the ratio to its final form\nAfter canceling out the $(k-n)!$ terms, we are left with $\\frac{(2n)(2n-1)(2n-2)\\cdots(k+1)k(k-1)\\cdots(n+1)n}{(k-n)!}$.\n\n## Step 14: Write the final answer\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{(2n)(2n-1)(2n-2)\\cdots(k+1)k(k-1)\\cdots(n+1)n}{(k-n)!}}$",
  "Step 1:  The problem asks us to find all functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the given functional equation and the condition $f(-1) \\neq 0$.\nStep 2:  To start solving this problem, we can use the given functional equation and the condition $f(-1) \\neq 0$ to derive some initial results.\nStep 3:  We are given the functional equation $f(1+x y)-f(x+y)=f(x) f(y)$ for all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nStep 4:  We can start by substituting specific values for $x$ and $y$ to simplify the equation and derive useful information.\nStep 5:  Setting $x = y = 0$, we get $f(1) - f(0) = f(0)^2$. This gives us an initial relationship between $f(1)$ and $f(0)$.\nStep 6:  Setting $x = 0$ and $y = -1$, we get $f(-1) - f(-1) = f(0) f(-1)$. This simplifies to $0 = f(0) f(-1)$, which implies that $f(0) = 0$ since $f(-1) \\neq 0$.\nStep 7:  Setting $y = 0$, we get $f(1 + x \\cdot 0) - f(x + 0) = f(x) f(0)$. This simplifies to $f(1) - f(x) = 0$, which gives us $f(1) = f(x)$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nStep 8:  Setting $x = 1$, we get $f(1 + y) - f(1 + y) = f(1) f(y)$. This simplifies to $0 = f(1) f(y)$, which implies that $f(y) = 0$ for all $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, we have found that $f(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nStep 10:  Hence, the only function that satisfies the given conditions is the function $f(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of disjoint pairs of elements from the set $\\{1,2, \\ldots, n\\}$ such that the sums of the different pairs are different integers not exceeding $n$.\nStep 2:  We can start by considering the possible pairs of elements from the set. Since the pairs need to be disjoint, we can't have any pair with the same elements.\nStep 3:  Let's consider the sum of the pairs. We want the sums to be different integers not exceeding $n$. This means that the sum of each pair should be unique.\nStep 4:  We can start by pairing the smallest element with the largest element, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on. This way, we ensure that the sums of the pairs are different.\nStep 5:  For example, if we have the set $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$, we can pair $1$ with $4$, $2$ with $3$, and then we're left with no more pairs.\nStep 6:  Now, let's consider the maximum number of pairs we can form. We can see that we can form $\\frac{n}{2}$ pairs if $n$ is even, and $\\frac{n-1}{2}$ pairs if $n$ is odd.\nStep 7:  However, we need to consider the case where $n$ is even. In this case, we can form $\\frac{n}{2}$ pairs, but we need to check if the sums of these pairs are all different.\nStep 8:  If the sums of the pairs are all different, then we have found the maximum number of disjoint pairs.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the maximum number of disjoint pairs of elements from the set $\\{1,2, \\ldots, n\\}$ such that the sums of the different pairs are different integers not exceeding $n$ is $\\frac{n}{2}$ if $n$ is even, and $\\frac{n-1}{2}$ if $n$ is odd.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{n}{2}}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to carefully consider the conditions given and understand how to maximize the number of triples of cells that satisfy the specified conditions.\nStep 2:  We are dealing with a $999 \\times 999$ square table, where some cells are white and the remaining ones are red. We want to find the maximum value of $T$, which represents the number of triples $\\left(C_{1}, C_{2}, C_{3}\\right)$ of cells, where the first two cells are in the same row and the last two cells are in the same column, with $C_{1}$ and $C_{3}$ being white and $C_{2}$ being red.\nStep 3:  To approach this problem, we can start by considering the number of ways to choose the first white cell, $C_{1}$. There are $999 \\times 999$ possible choices for $C_{1}$.\nStep 4:  Next, we need to choose the second cell, $C_{2}$, which must be red and in the same row as $C_{1}$. There are $999 - 1$ possible choices for $C_{2}$, as we have already chosen one cell in the row.\nStep 5:  Then, we need to choose the third cell, $C_{3}$, which must be white and in the same column as $C_{2}$. There are $999 - 1$ possible choices for $C_{3}$, as we have already chosen one cell in the column.\nStep 6:  However, we need to account for the fact that the order of choosing $C_{1}$, $C_{2}$, and $C_{3}$ does not matter. This means that we have counted each valid triple three times, so we need to divide the total count by $3$ to avoid overcounting.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the maximum value of $T$ can be calculated as $\\frac{999 \\times 999 \\times (999 - 1) \\times (999 - 1)}{3}$.\nStep 8:  By simplifying this expression, we can find the maximum value of $T$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{333333000000}$",

Since there are 2012 boxes, the minimum number of coins required is 2012.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the effect of player B's moves on the number of coins.\nOn every move of his, player B passes 1 coin from every box to an adjacent box.

She passes every chosen coin to an adjacent box. This means that player A can move coins around, but she cannot create new coins or remove existing coins.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the least N that enables player A to succeed.\nSince player A needs to ensure that there is at least 1 coin in each box after every move of hers, the least N that enables her to succeed is the minimum number of coins required to achieve this goal, which is 2012.\n\n## Step 6: Consider the possibility of player B creating a situation where player A cannot move coins.\nIf player B creates a situation where all coins are in the same box, player A cannot move coins to ensure that there is at least 1 coin in each box.

  "To solve this problem, we need to consider the conditions given and find the minimum number of blue cells required to satisfy them.\n\n## Step 1: Understand the conditions for the blue cells\nEvery cell in the array must be related to at least two blue cells. This means that for any given cell, there must be at least two blue cells in the same row or column as that cell.\n\n## Step 2: Consider the minimum number of blue cells needed in each row\nSince every cell must be related to at least two blue cells, and there are $4m$ cells in each row, we need at least two blue cells in each row to satisfy this condition.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the minimum number of blue cells needed in each column\nSimilarly, since every cell must be related to at least two blue cells, and there are $4m$ cells in each column, we need at least two blue cells in each column to satisfy this condition.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the minimum number of blue cells required\nTo satisfy the conditions in both rows and columns, we need at least two blue cells in each row and two blue cells in each column. However, we can't simply multiply these numbers together, as that would overcount the number of blue cells. Instead, we need to consider the minimum number of blue cells required to satisfy both conditions simultaneously.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the minimum number of blue cells required to satisfy both row and column conditions\nSince we need at least two blue cells in each row and two blue cells in each column, we can place two blue cells in each row. However, this would not satisfy the column condition, as there would be only two blue cells in each column. To satisfy both conditions, we need to place blue cells in a way that satisfies both the row and column conditions.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the minimum number of blue cells required to satisfy both row and column conditions\nTo satisfy both conditions, we can place blue cells in a checkerboard pattern, with blue cells in every other row and column. This would ensure that every cell is related to at least two blue cells, both in the same row and in the same column.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the minimum number of blue cells required\nIn a $4m \\times 4m$ array, we can place blue cells in every other row and column. This would require $2m$ blue cells in each row and $2m$ blue cells in each column. However, we need to consider the overlap between rows and columns.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the minimum number of blue cells required, considering overlap\nSince we are placing blue cells in a checkerboard pattern, every other cell in each row and column will be blue. This means that we will have $2m$ blue cells in each row, but we will also have $2m$ blue cells in each column. However, the blue cells in each row will overlap with the blue cells in each column, resulting in a total of $2m$ blue cells per row and column.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the total minimum number of blue cells required\nSince we have $2m$ blue cells in each row and column, and there are $4m$ rows and columns, we can calculate the total minimum number of blue cells required.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate the total minimum number of blue cells required\nThe total minimum number of blue cells required is $2m \\times 2m = 4m^2$.\n\n## Step 11: Simplify the expression for the minimum number of blue cells\nHowever, we need to consider that the blue cells are placed in a checkerboard pattern, which means that every other cell is blue. This results in a total of $2m^2$ blue cells.\n\n## Step 12: Calculate the final minimum number of blue cells required\nThe final minimum number of blue cells required is $2m^2$.\n\n## Step 13: Simplify the expression for the minimum number of blue cells\nHowever, we can simplify this expression further by considering the properties of the array.\n\n## Step 14: Simplify the expression for the minimum number of blue cells\nSince the array is a $4m \\times 4m$ array, we can divide the array into smaller sub-arrays of size $4 \\times 4$.

This gives us a clue about the relationship between the terms in the sequence.\nStep 4:  Let's denote the number of terms in the original sequence as $2n+1$, where $n$ is a positive integer.

$75 \\%$ greater when its digits are reversed.\nStep 2:  Let's assume the two-digit number is represented as $10a + b$, where $a$ is the tens digit and $b$ is the units digit.\nStep 3:  When the digits are reversed, the new number becomes $10b + a$.\nStep 4:  We are given that the new number is $75 \\%$ greater than the original number, so we can set up the equation $10b + a = \\frac{7}{5}(10a + b)$.\nStep 5:  Simplifying this equation, we get $50b + 5a = 70a + 7b$, which further simplifies to $43b = 65a$.\nStep 6:  Since $a$ and $b$ are digits, they must be integers between $0$ and $9$, inclusive.\nStep 7:  We need to find the largest possible value of $a$ such that $43b = 65a$ has a solution where $a$ and $b$ are integers.\nStep 8:  To find the largest possible value of $a$, we can divide both sides of the equation by $5$ to get $8.6b = 13a$.\nStep 9:  Since $a$ and $b$ are integers, $13a$ must be a multiple of $8.6$, which is not possible.\nStep 10:  However, we can try to find the largest possible value of $a$ such that $43b = 65a$ has a solution where $a$ and $b$ are integers.\nStep 11:  We can start by trying $a = 7$, which gives us $43b = 65

which is an integer.\nStep 20:  However, we are looking for the largest two-digit number, so we need to try $a = 9$.\nStep 21:  Trying $a = 9$, we get $43b = 65 \\times 9 = 585$, which gives us $b = \\frac{585}{43} = 13.58$, which is not an integer.\nStep 22:  Trying $a = 8$, we get $43b = 65 \\times 8 = 520$, which gives us $b = \\frac{520}{43} = 12.09$, which is not an integer.\nStep 23:

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between Serge's paddling speed, the speed of the current, and the time it takes him to travel from point $A$ to point $B$.\nStep 2:  Let's denote Serge's paddling speed as $p$ and the speed of the current as $c$. When Serge paddles with the current, his effective speed is $p + c$, and it takes him 18 minutes to travel from $A$ to $B$. This can be represented by the equation $\\frac{d}{p + c} = 18$, where $d$ is the distance between points $A$ and $B$.\nStep 3:  On the other hand, when Serge paddles against the current, his effective speed is $p - c$, and it takes him 30 minutes to travel from $A$ to $B$. This can be represented by the equation $\\frac{d}{p - c} = 30$.\nStep 4:  We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of $p$ and $c$. By multiplying both sides of the first equation by $p + c$ and both sides of the second equation by $p - c$, we get $d = 18(p + c)$ and $d = 30(p - c)$.\nStep 5:  Equating these two expressions for $d$, we have $18(p + c) = 30(p - c)$. Simplifying this equation, we get $18p + 18c = 30p - 30c$, which further simplifies to $48c = 12p$.\nStep 6:  Solving for $c$ in terms of $p$, we find that $c = \\frac{p}{4}$.\nStep 7:  Now, we need to find the time it would take Serge to paddle from $A$ to $B$ if there were no current. This can be represented by the equation $\\frac{d}{p} = t$, where $t$ is the time taken.\nStep 8:  Substituting the value of $d$ from the first equation, we get $\\frac{18(p + c)}{p} = t$. Since $c = \\frac{p}{4}$, we can substitute this value to get $\\frac{18(p + \\frac{p}{4})}{p} = t$.\nStep 9:  Simplifying this expression, we get $\\frac{18(\\frac{5p}{4})}{p} = t$, which further simplifies to $\\frac{45}{2} = t$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the time it would take Serge to paddle from $A$ to $B$ if there were no current is $\\frac{45}{2}$ minutes.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{45}{2}}",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first understand the given scenario. We have a square $O P Q R$ with vertices at $O(0,0), P(0,8), Q(8,8)$, and $R(8,0)$. The parabola with equation $y=a(x-2)(x-6)$ intersects the sides of the square at points $K, L, M$, and $N$.\nStep 2:  We are asked to find all the values of $a$ for which the area of the trapezoid $K L M N$ is 36.\nStep 3:  To approach this problem, we need to find the coordinates of the points $K, L, M$, and $N$ where the parabola intersects the sides of the square.\nStep 4:  We start by finding the intersection points of the parabola with the sides of the square. We consider the line $OP$ with equation $x=0$ and the line $OQ$ with equation $y=8$.\nStep 5:  By substituting $x=0$ into the equation of the parabola, we find that the point $K$ is $(0,24a)$. Similarly, by substituting $y=8$ into the equation of the parabola, we find that the point $L$ is $(4,8)$.\nStep 6:  We repeat this process for the other two sides of the square to find the coordinates of points $M$ and $N$.\nStep 7:  After finding the coordinates of all four points, we can use the formula for the area of a trapezoid to set up an equation and solve for the value of $a$.\nStep 8:  We then need to consider the cases where the trapezoid $K L M N$ is a parallelogram, and solve for the value of $a$ in that case as well.\nStep 9:  By considering both cases, we can find all the possible values of $a$ for which the area of the trapezoid $K L M N$ is 36.\nStep 10:  We will then have the final values of $a$ that satisfy the given condition.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-\\frac{3}{2}}$",

This allows us to relate the probabilities of living at least 5 more years to the probabilities of living at least 10 more years.\nStep 8:  We can use the given probabilities to calculate the probability of an 80-year-old person living at least another 5 years.\nStep 9:  First, we note that if an 80-year-old person lives at least 5 more years, they must live at least 10 more years. This means that the probability of living at least 5 more years is less than or equal to the probability of living at least 10 more years.\nStep 10:  We can use the given probabilities to calculate the probability of an 80-year-old person living at least another 5 years.\nStep 11:  We know that the probability of living at least 10 more years is $25 \\%$, so the probability of living at least 5 more years is also $25 \\%$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the probability that an 80-year-old person will live at least another 5 years is $\\boxed{25 \\%}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{25}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of both geometric and arithmetic sequences.\nStep 2:  A geometric sequence is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio. In this case, the common ratio is $r$.\nStep 3:  An arithmetic sequence, on the other hand, is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant to the previous term. This constant is called the common difference.\nStep 4:  We are given the three-term geometric sequence $4, 4r, 4r^2$ and we need to find all possible values of $r$ such that this sequence is also an arithmetic sequence.\nStep 5:  For the sequence to be arithmetic, the difference between consecutive terms must be constant. In other words, the difference between the second and first term must be equal to the difference between the third and second term.\nStep 6:  Mathematically, this can be expressed as $4r - 4 = 4r^2 - 4r$.\nStep 7:  We can simplify this equation to find the values of $r$ that satisfy this condition.\nStep 8:  First, we can rearrange the equation to get $4r^2 - 5r = 0$.\nStep 9:  Factoring out $r$, we get $r(4r - 5) = 0$.\nStep 10:  This gives us two possible solutions: $r = 0$ and $4r - 5 = 0$.\nStep 11:  Solving for $r$ in the second equation, we get $r = \\frac{5}{4}$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the possible values of $r$ are $0$ and $\\frac{5}{4}$.\nStep 13:  However, we need to check if these values satisfy the condition of the sequence being arithmetic.\nStep 14:  If $r = 0$, the sequence becomes $4, 0, 0$, which is not an arithmetic sequence.\nStep 15:  Therefore, the only possible value of $r$ that makes the sequence arithmetic is $\\frac{5}{4}$.\nStep 16:  Hence, the final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{4}}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{4}}$",

  "Solve the following math problem with clear step\u2011by\u2011step reasoning.\nThe given inequality is $0<\\frac{x^{2}-11}{x+1}<7$. We can start by splitting the inequality into two separate inequalities: $\\frac{x^{2}-11}{x+1}>0$ and $\\frac{x^{2}-11}{x+1}<7$.\n\n## Step 1: Solve the first inequality $\\frac{x^{2}-11}{x+1}>0$\nTo solve this inequality, we need to find the critical points of the expression $\\frac{x^{2}-11}{x+1}$. The critical points occur when the numerator or denominator equals zero. The numerator equals zero when $x^{2}-11=0$, which gives $x=\\pm\\sqrt{11}$. The denominator equals zero when $x+1=0$, which gives $x=-1$. We can use these critical points to create intervals on the real number line and test each interval to see where the expression is positive.\n\n## Step 2: Test each interval for the first inequality\nWe have three intervals to test: $(-\\infty,-1)$, $(-1,\\sqrt{11})$, and $(\\sqrt{11},\\infty)$. We can choose a test value from each interval and substitute it into the expression $\\frac{x^{2}-11}{x+1}$ to see if it is positive.\n\n## Step 3: Test the interval $(-\\infty,-1)$\nLet's choose $x=-2$ as a test value. Substituting $x=-2$ into the expression gives $\\frac{(-2)^{2}-11}{-2+1}=\\frac{4-11}{-1}=\\frac{-7}{-1}=7$. Since the expression is positive in this interval, we can include it in the solution set.\n\n## Step 4: Test the interval $(-1,\\sqrt{11})$\nLet's choose $x=0$ as a test value. Substituting $x=0$ into the expression gives $\\frac{0^{2}-11}{0+1}=\\frac{-11}{1}=-11$. Since the expression is negative in this interval, we can exclude it from the solution set.\n\n## Step 5: Test the interval $(\\sqrt{11},\\infty)$\nLet's choose $x=3$ as a test value. Substituting $x=3$ into the expression gives $\\frac{3^{2}-11}{3+1}=\\frac{9-11}{4}=\\frac{-2}{4}=-\\frac{1}{2}$. Since the expression is negative in this interval, we can exclude it from the solution set.\n\n## Step 6: Solve the second inequality $\\frac{x^{2}-11}{x+1}<7$\nWe can start by multiplying both sides of the inequality by $x+1$ to get rid of the fraction. This gives $x^{2}-11<7(x+1)$. We can then expand the right-hand side to get $x^{2}-11<7x+7$. Next, we can subtract $7x+7$ from both sides to get $x^{2}-7x-18<0$. We can factor the left-hand side to get $(x-9)(x+2)<0$. We can then find the critical points by setting each factor equal to zero. This gives $x-9=0$ and $x+2=0$, which gives $x=9$ and $x=-2$.\n\n## Step 7: Test each interval for the second inequality\nWe have three intervals to test: $(-\\infty,-2)$, $(-2,9)$, and $(9,\\infty)$. We can choose a test value from each interval and substitute it into the expression $(x-9)(x+2)$ to see if it is negative.\n\n## Step 8: Test the interval $(-\\infty,-2)$\nLet's choose $x=-3$ as a test value. Substituting $x=-3$ into the expression gives $(-3-9)(-3+2)=(-12)(-1)=12$. Since the expression is positive in this interval, we can exclude it from the solution set.\n\n## Step 9: Test the interval $(-2,9)$\nLet's choose $x=0$ as a test value. Substituting $x=0$ into the expression gives $(0-9)(0+2)=(-9)(2)=-18$. Since the expression is negative in this interval, we can include it in the solution set.\n\n## Step 10: Test the interval $(9,\\infty)$\nLet's choose $x=10$ as a test value. Substituting $x=10$ into the expression gives $(10-9)(10+2)=(1)(12)=12$. Since the expression is positive in this interval, we can exclude it from the solution set.\n\n## Step 11: Combine the solutions of the two inequalities\nThe solution set of the first inequality is $(-\\infty,-1)\\cup(\\sqrt{11},\\infty)$, and the solution set of the second inequality is $(-2,9)$. We can combine these solution sets to get the final solution set.\n\n## Step 12: Write the final solution set\nThe final solution set is $(-2,9)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(-2,9)}",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of arithmetic and geometric sequences.\nStep 2:  We are given that the numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, \\ldots$ form an arithmetic sequence with $a_{1} \\neq a_{2}$. This means that the difference between consecutive terms is constant.\nStep 3:  Additionally, we are told that the three numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{6}$ form a geometric sequence in that order. This implies that the ratio of consecutive terms is constant.\nStep 4:  We are asked to determine all possible positive integers $k$ for which the three numbers $a_{1}, a_{4}, a_{k}$ also form a geometric sequence in that order.\nStep 5:  Let's start by expressing the terms of the arithmetic sequence in terms of $a_1$ and the common difference $d$. This gives us $a_2 = a_1 + d$, $a_3 = a_1 + 2d$, and $a_6 = a_1 + 5d$.\nStep 6:  Since $a_1, a_2, a_6$ form a geometric sequence, we have the equation $a_2^2 = a_1 a_6$. Substituting the expressions for $a_2$ and $a_6$, we get $(a_1 + d)^2 = a_1 (a_1 + 5d)$.\nStep 7:  Expanding and simplifying this equation, we obtain $a_1^2 + 2a_1 d + d^2 = a_1^2 + 5a_1 d$, which simplifies to $3a_1 d = d^2$.\nStep 8:  Since $a_1 \\neq a_2$, we know that $d \\neq 0$, so we can divide both sides by $d$ to get $3a_1 = d$.\nStep 9:  Now, we need to find the value of $k$ for which $a_1, a_4, a_k$ form a geometric sequence. We can express $a_4$ as $a_1 + 3d$ and $a_k$ as $a_1 + (k-1)d$.\nStep 10:  The condition for a geometric sequence is $a_4^2 = a_1 a_k$. Substituting the expressions for $a_4$ and $a_k$, we get $(a_1 + 3d)^2 = a_1 (a_1 + (k-1)d)$.\nStep 11:  Expanding and simplifying this equation, we obtain $a_1^2 + 6a_1 d + 9d^2 = a_1^2 + (k-1)a_1 d$.\nStep 12:  Simplifying further, we get $6a_1 d + 9d^2 = (k-1)a_1 d$.\nStep 13:  Since $3a_1 = d$, we can substitute this into the equation to get $18a_1^2 + 9d^2 = (k-1)a_1 d$.\nStep 14:  Substituting $d = 3a_1$ into the equation, we get $18a_1^2 + 9(3a_1)^2 = (k-1)a_1 (3a_1)$.\nStep 15:  Simplifying this equation, we obtain $18a_1^2 + 81a_1^2 = 3a_1^2 (k-1)$.\nStep 16:  Combining like terms, we get $99a_1^2 = 3a_1^2 (k-1)$.\nStep 17:  Dividing both sides by $3a_1^2$, we obtain $33 = k-1$.\nStep 18:  Solving for $k$, we find that $k = 34$.\nStep 19:  Therefore, the only possible positive integer $k$ for which the three numbers $a_1, a_4, a_k$ form a geometric sequence in that order is $k = \\boxed{34}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{34}$",

To do this, we substitute the equation of the parabola into the equation of the circle.\nStep 3:  Substituting $y=\\frac{x^{2}}{k}-5$ into $x^{2}+y^{2}=25$, we get $x^{2}+\\left(\\frac{x^{2}}{k}-5\\right)^{2}=25$.\nStep 4:  Expanding and simplifying this equation, we arrive at a quartic equation in terms of $x$.\nStep 5:  We then use the quadratic formula to solve for $x$, which gives us two possible values for $x$.\nStep 6:  The two values of $x$ are $x=\\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{k^{2}-10k+25}{k}}$.\nStep 7:  We then find the corresponding values of $y$ by substituting these $x$ values into the equation of the parabola.\nStep 8:  The $y$ values are $y=\\frac{k\\pm\\sqrt{k^{2}-10k+25}}{k}$.\nStep 9:  We then use the distance formula to find the lengths of the sides of the triangle formed by the intersection points.\nStep 10:  The distance between the points $(x_{1},y_{1})$ and $(x_{2},y_{2})$ is given by $\\sqrt{(x_{2}-x_{1})^{2}+(y_{2}-y_{1})^{2}}$.\nStep 11:  We find that the side lengths of the triangle are $2\\sqrt{\\frac{k^{2}-10k+25}{k}}$, $2\\sqrt{\\frac{k^{2}-10k+25}{k}}$, and $2\\sqrt{\\frac{k^{2}-10k+25}{k}}$.\nStep 12:  Since the triangle is equilateral, we can use the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle, which is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times (\\text{side length})^{2}$.\nStep 13:  Substituting the side length, we get the area of the triangle as $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times \\left(2\\sqrt{\\frac{k^{2}-10k+25}{k}}\\right)^{2}$.\nStep 14:  Simplifying this expression, we find that the area of the triangle is $\\frac{3}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{(k^{2}-10k+25)^{2}}{k^{2}}}$.\nStep 15:  We are given that the area of the triangle is an integer, so we need to find the values of $k$ for which this expression is an integer.\nStep 16:  This means that $\\frac{3}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{(k^{2}-10k+25)^{2}}{k^{2}}}$ must be an integer.\nStep 17:  We can simplify this expression further to get $\\frac{3}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{(k-5)^{4}}{k^{2}}}$.\nStep 18:  For this expression to be an integer, the numerator $(k-5)^{4}$ must be a multiple of $4$.\nStep 19:  This means that $k-5$ must be even, so $k$ must be odd.\nStep 20:  Therefore, the possible values of $k$ are $k=1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21,23,25,27,29,31,33,35,37,39,41,43,45,47,49,51,53,55,57,59,61,63,65,67,69,71,73,75,77,79,81,83,85,87,89,91,93,95,97,99,101,103,105,107,109,111,113,115,117,119,121,123,125,127,129,131,133,135,137,139,141,143,145,147,149,151,153,155,157,159,161,163,165,167,169,171,173,175,177,179,181,183,185,187,189,191,193,195,197,199,201,203,205,207,209,211,213,215,217,219,221,223,225,227,229,231,233,235,237,239,241,243,245,247,249,251,253,255,257,259,261,263,265,267,269,271,273,275,277,279,281,283,285,287,289,291,293,295,297,299,301,303,305,307,309,311,313,315,317,319,321,323,325,327,329,331,333,335,337,339,341,343,345,347,349,351,353,355,357,359,361,363,365,367,369,371,373,375,377,379,381,383,385,387,389,391,393,395,397,399,401,403,405,407,409,411,413,415,417,419,421,423,425,427,429,431,433,435,437,439,441,443,445,447,449,451,453,455,457,459,461,463,465,467,469,471,473,475,477,479,481,483,485,487,489,491,493,495,497,499,501,503,505,507,509,511,513,515,517,519,521,523,525,527,529,531,533,535,537,539,541,543,545,547,549,551,553,555,557,559,561,563,565,567,569,571,573,575,577,579,581,583,585,587,589,591,593,595,597,599,601,603,605,607,609,611,613,615,617,619,621,623,625,627,629,631,633,635,637,639,641,643,645,647,649,651,653,655,657,659,661,663,665,667,669,671,673,675,677,679,681,683,685,687,689,691,693,695,697,699,701,703,705,707,709,711,713,715,717,719,721,723,725,727,729,731,733,735,737,739,741,743,745,747,749,751,753,755,757,759,761,763,765,767,769,771,773,775,777,779,781,783,785,787,789,791,793,795,797,799,801,803,805,807,809,811,813,815,817,819,821,823,825,827,829,831,833,835,837,839,841,843,845,847,849,851,853,855,857,859,861,863,865,867,869,871,873,875,877,879,881,883,885,887,889,891,893,895,897,899,901,903,905,907,909,911,913,915,917,919,921,923,925,927,929,931,933,935,937,939,941,943,945,947,949,951,953,955,957,959,961,963,965,967,969,971,973,975,977,979,981,983,985,987,989,991,993,995,997,999$.\nStep 21:  Therefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{1}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

The total number of pixels in this image is given by the product of the number of pixels in each dimension, which is $(10 \\times 75) \\times(15 \\times 75)=843750$ pixels.\nStep 3:  Now, we're told that if each of the dimensions was increased by $n \\%$ and the resolution was decreased by $n \\%$, the image would have 345600 pixels.\nStep 4:  We can express the new dimensions as $10(1+\\frac{n}{100})$ and $15(1+\\frac{n}{100})$, and the new resolution as $75(1-\\frac{n}{100})$.\nStep 5:  The total number of pixels in the new image is then given by the product of these new dimensions and resolution, which is $10(1+\\frac{n}{100}) \\times 15(1+\\frac{n}{100}) \\times 75(1-\\frac{n}{100})$.\nStep 6:  We're given that this new total is equal to 345600 pixels, so we can set up the equation $10(1+\\frac{n}{100}) \\times 15(1+\\frac{n}{100}) \\times 75(1-\\frac{n}{100})=345600$.\nStep 7:  Simplifying this equation, we get $(1+\\frac{n}{100})^2(1-\\frac{n}{100}) \\times 10 \\times 15 \\times 75=345600$.\nStep 8:  Further simplifying, we have $(1+\\frac{n}{100})^2(1-\\frac{n}{100})=345600/1125=307.2$.\nStep 9:  We can then express this as a quadratic equation in terms of $n$, which is $(1+\\frac{n}{100})^2(1-\\frac{n}{100})=307.2$.\nStep 10:  Expanding and simplifying, we get $(1-\\frac{n^2}{10000})=307.2$.\nStep 11:  Rearranging, we have $1-\\frac{n^2}{10000}=307.2$.\nStep 12:  Solving for $n^2$, we get $n^2=10000(1-307.2)$.\nStep 13:  Simplifying further, we have $n^2=10000 \\times -306.2$.\nStep 14:  Therefore, $n^2= -3062000$.\nStep 15:  Taking the square root of both sides, we get $n = \\pm \\sqrt{-3062000}$.\nStep 16:  Since the value of $n$ must be positive, we take the positive square root, which gives us $n = \\sqrt{-3062000}$.\nStep 17:  However, we need to find the numerical value of $n$, so we'll calculate the square root of $-3062000$.\nStep 18:  The square root of $-3062000$ is approximately $1749.5$.\nStep 19:  Therefore, the value of $n$ is approximately $1749.5$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1749.5}$",

This means that each integer from 1 to $n$ appears exactly twice in the sequence.\nStep 3:  The second condition states that if $s_{i}=s_{j}=k$ with $i<j$, then $j-i=k$. This implies that if two equal elements appear in the sequence, the difference between their positions is equal to the value of the elements.\nStep 4:  The third condition states that between any two equal even integers, there is exactly one odd integer. This condition restricts the arrangement of the elements in the sequence.\nStep 5:  We are given that $s_{3}=1$ and $s_{18}=8$. We need to find all Skolem sequences of order 9 that satisfy these conditions.\nStep 6:  We start by considering the placement of the elements 1 and 8 in the sequence. Since $s_{3}=1$, the next occurrence of 1 must be at position 4, and the next occurrence of 8 must be at position 18.\nStep 7:  We then consider the placement of the elements 2 and 7. Since $s_{18}=8$, the next occurrence of 8 must be at position 18, and the next occurrence of 7 must be at position 16.\nStep 8:  We continue this process, considering the placement of the elements 3 and 6, and then the placement of the elements 4 and 5.\nStep 9:  After carefully analyzing the conditions and the placement of the elements, we find that there are two possible Skolem sequences of order 9 that satisfy all the given conditions.\nStep 10:  The first sequence is $(4,2,1,1,3,3,5,5,7,7,9,9,11,11,13,13,15,8,8)$.\nStep 11:  The second sequence is $(4,2,1,1,3,3,5,5,7,7,9,9,11,11,13,13,15,8,8)$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the two possible Skolem sequences of order 9 that satisfy all the given conditions are $(4,2,1,1,3,3,5,5,7,7,9,9,11,11,13,13,15,8,8)$ and $(4,2,1,1,3,3,5,5,7,7,9,9,11,11,13,13,15,8,8)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",

Substituting this into the equation $g\\left(f\\left(g^{-1}(x)\\right)\\right) = 2x^2 + 16x + 26$, we get $g(f(y)) = 2x^2 + 16x + 26$.\nStep 6:  Since $g(y) = x$, we can substitute $x$ with $g(y)$ in the equation $g(f(y)) = 2x^2 + 16x + 26$, giving us $g(f(y)) = 2(g(y))^2 + 16(g(y)) + 26$.\nStep 7:  Now, we can use the fact that $g(y) = 2y - 4$ to substitute for $g(y)$ in the equation $g(f(y)) = 2(g(y))^2 + 16(g(y)) + 26$, which gives us $g(f(y)) = 2(2y - 4)^2 + 16(2y - 4) + 26$.\nStep 8:  Simplifying this expression, we get $g(f(y)) = 2(4y^2 - 16y + 16) + 32y - 64 + 26 = 8y^2 - 32y + 32 + 32y - 64 + 26 = 8y^2 - 6$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, we have $g(f(y)) = 8y^2 - 6$.\nStep 10:  Now, we can use the fact that $g(y) = 2y - 4$ to find $f(y)$. We have $g(f(y)) = 8y^2 - 6$, so $2y - 4 = 8y^2 - 6$.\nStep 11:  Solving for $y$, we get $8y^2 - 2y + 2 = 0$. Using the quadratic formula, we find that $y = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - 32}}{16} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{-31}}{16}$.\nStep 12:  Since $y$ is a real number, we must have $y = \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{-31}}{16}$.\nStep 13:  Now, we can find $f(\\pi)$ by substituting $y = \\pi$ into the expression for $f(y)$. We have $f(\\pi) = \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{-31}}{16} + 2$.\nStep 14:  Therefore, the value of $f(\\pi)$ is $\\frac{1 - \\sqrt{-31}}{16} + 2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2 + \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{-31}}{16}}",
  "Step 1:  The problem presents a system of logarithmic equations involving trigonometric functions. We need to find all pairs of angles $(x, y)$ that satisfy these equations.\nStep 2:  The first equation is $\\log _{2}(\\sin x \\cos y) = -\\frac{3}{2}$. This can be rewritten in exponential form as $2^{-3/2} = \\sin x \\cos y$. Similarly, the second equation $\\log _{2}\\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos y}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}$ can be rewritten as $2^{1/2} = \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos y}$.\nStep 3:  We can then use these exponential forms to derive relationships between $\\sin x$ and $\\cos y$.\nStep 4:  From the first equation, we have $\\sin x \\cos y = 2^{-3/2} = \\frac{1}{2 \\sqrt{2}}$. This gives us a relationship between $\\sin x$ and $\\cos y$.\nStep 5:  From the second equation, we have $\\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos y} = 2^{1/2} = \\sqrt{2}$. This gives us another relationship between $\\sin x$ and $\\cos y$.\nStep 6:  We can then use these relationships to find the values of $\\sin x$ and $\\cos y$.\nStep 7:  By solving for $\\sin x$ and $\\cos y$, we can then find the corresponding values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the system of equations.\nStep 8:  We need to ensure that the values of $x$ and $y$ lie within the specified range of $0^{\\circ} \\leq x<180^{\\circ}$ and $0^{\\circ} \\leq y<180^{\\circ}$.\nStep 9:  After finding the values of $x$ and $y$, we can then present the pairs of angles $(x, y)$ that satisfy the system of equations.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\left( \\frac{\\pi}{4}, \\frac{7 \\pi}{12} \\right)}",

Since Alain, Bianca, and Chen are equally matched, the probability of each player winning is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\nStep 3:  Now, let's consider the different ways Bianca can win the tournament. There are two possible scenarios: (1) Bianca wins the first match against Alain, and then wins the second match against Chen, and finally wins the third match against Dave; (2) Bianca loses the first match against Alain, and then wins the second match against Chen, and finally wins the third match against Dave.\nStep 4:  In the first scenario, the probability of Bianca winning the first match against Alain is $\\frac{1}{2}$. Then, the probability of Bianca winning the second match against Chen is also $\\frac{1}{2}$. Finally, the probability of Bianca winning the third match against Dave is $p$.\nStep 5:  In the second scenario, the probability of Bianca losing the first match against Alain is $\\frac{1}{2}$.

Finally, the probability of Bianca winning the third match against Dave is $p$.\nStep 6:  We need to calculate the probability of each scenario and then add them together to get the overall probability of Bianca winning the tournament.\nStep 7:  The probability of the first scenario is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot p = \\frac{p}{4}$.\nStep 8:  The probability of the second scenario is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot p = \\frac{p}{4}$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the overall probability of Bianca winning the tournament is $\\frac{p}{4} + \\frac{p}{4} = \\frac{p}{2}$.\nStep 10:  However, we also need to consider the probability of Bianca winning the first match against Alain, and then losing the second match against Chen, and finally winning the third match against Dave. This probability is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot (1-p) = \\frac{1-p}{4}$.\nStep 11:  Similarly, we need to consider the probability of Bianca losing the first match against Alain, and then winning the second match against Chen, and finally winning the third match against Dave. This probability is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot (1-p) = \\frac{1-p}{4}$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the overall probability of Bianca winning the tournament is $\\frac{p}{2} + \\frac{1-p}{4} + \\frac{1-p}{4} = \\frac{2p + 1 - p}{4} = \\frac{p + 1}{4}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{p + 1}{4}}",

The sound travels at a speed of $\\frac{1}{3} \\mathrm{~km} / \\mathrm{s}$.\nStep 2:  We are given the time it takes for each microphone to receive the sound. Microphone B receives the sound first, microphone A receives it $\\frac{1}{2}$ s later, and microphone C receives it 1 s after microphone A.\nStep 3:  Let's denote the distance from microphone B to the explosion point P as $x$.

The list of pairwise sums is then ordered in ascending order.\nStep 2:  We are given that $n=4$ and the 6 pairwise sums are $s_{1}=8, s_{2}=104, s_{3}=106$, $s_{4}=110, s_{5}=112$, and $s_{6}=208$. We need to determine two possible lists $(a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, a_{4})$ that Kerry could have.\nStep 3:  To approach this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the pairwise sums and the original list of integers. The sum of all pairwise sums is related to the sum of the squares of the integers in the list.\nStep 4:  We are given that the sum of all pairwise sums is $2\\sum_{i=1}^{4} a_{i}$. This means that the sum of the pairwise sums is equal to twice the sum of the individual integers in the list.\nStep 5:  We can use this relationship to find the sum of the individual integers in the list, which is $\\sum_{i=1}^{4} a_{i} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{6} s_{i} = \\frac{1}{2} (8 + 104 + 106 + 110 + 112 + 208) = 448$.\nStep 6:  Now, we need to find two possible lists $(a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, a_{4})$ that satisfy the given conditions.

  "Solve the following math problem with clear step\u2011by\u2011step reasoning.\nTo solve the equation $\\frac{x^{2}+x+4}{2 x+1}=\\frac{4}{x}$, we need to follow these steps:\n\n## Step 1: Multiply both sides of the equation by the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators to eliminate the fractions.\nThe LCM of $2x+1$ and $x$ is $(2x+1)x$. Multiplying both sides by $(2x+1)x$ gives us $(x^{2}+x+4)x = 4(2x+1)$.\n\n## Step 2: Distribute and simplify both sides of the equation.\nDistributing the $x$ on the left side gives us $x^{3}+x^{2}+4x = 8x+4$. Simplifying the right side gives us $x^{3}+x^{2}+4x = 8x+4$.\n\n## Step 3: Subtract $8x+4$ from both sides to get all terms on one side of the equation.\nSubtracting $8x+4$ from both sides gives us $x^{3}+x^{2}-4x-4 = 0$.\n\n## Step 4: Factor the equation if possible.\nUnfortunately, this equation does not factor easily, so we will need to use other methods to solve it.\n\n## Step 5: Use the Rational Root Theorem to find possible rational roots of the equation.\nThe Rational Root Theorem tells us that any rational root of the equation must be of the form $p/q$, where $p$ is a factor of the constant term $-4$ and $q$ is a factor of the leading coefficient $1$. The factors of $-4$ are $\\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm4$, and the only factor of $1$ is $\\pm1$. Therefore, the possible rational roots are $\\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm4$.\n\n## Step 6: Test the possible rational roots to find a root of the equation.\nWe can test these possible roots by substituting them into the equation and checking if the equation is true. Let's start with $x=1$. Substituting $x=1$ into the equation gives us $1^{3}+1^{2}-4(1)-4 = 1+1-4-4 = -6 \\neq 0$. Therefore, $x=1$ is not a root of the equation. Next, let's try $x=-1$. Substituting $x=-1$ into the equation gives us $(-1)^{3}+(-1)^{2}-4(-1)-4 = -1+1+4-4 = 0$. Therefore, $x=-1$ is a root of the equation.\n\n## Step 7: Factor the equation using the root we found.\nSince $x=-1$ is a root of the equation, we can factor the equation as $(x+1)(x^{2}-1) = 0$.\n\n## Step 8: Factor the quadratic expression in the equation.\nThe quadratic expression $x^{2}-1$ can be factored as $(x-1)(x+1)$.\n\n## Step 9: Set each factor equal to zero and solve for $x$.\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives us $x+1=0$ and $(x-1)(x+1)=0$. Solving for $x$ in the first equation gives us $x=-1$. Solving for $x$ in the second equation gives us $x-1=0$ or $x+1=0$. Solving for $x$ in the first equation gives us $x=1$.

Let's denote the amount of mixture from bottle A as $x$, from bottle B as $y$, and from bottle C as $z$.\nStep 7:  We know that the total mass of the new mixture is $60 \\mathrm{~g}$, so we have the equation $x + y + z = 60$.\nStep 8:  Additionally, we know that the total amount of acid in the new mixture is $15 \\mathrm{~g}$, so we have the equation $0.1x + 0.2y + 0.3z = 15$.\nStep 9:  We can solve this system of equations to find the values of $x$, $y$, and $z$.\nStep 10:  Once we have the values of $x$, $y$, and $z$, we can calculate the total amount of acid in the remaining mixture from each bottle by subtracting the amount used from the original amount.\nStep 11:  Finally, we can calculate the percentage of acid in the new mixture by dividing the total amount of acid in the new mixture by the total mass of the new mixture and multiplying by $100$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{28.57}$",

The number of ways to choose 2 gold balls from $g$ gold balls is given by $\\binom{g}{2}$, and the total number of ways to choose 2 balls from 40 is $\\binom{40}{2}$.\nStep 4:  Therefore, the probability of drawing two gold balls is $\\frac{\\binom{g}{2}}{\\binom{40}{2}} = \\frac{5}{12}$.\nStep 5:  We can simplify this equation to $\\frac{g(g-1)}{2} \\cdot \\frac{2}{40 \\cdot 39} = \\frac{5}{12}$.\nStep 6:  Multiplying both sides by $40 \\cdot 39$ to clear the denominators, we get $g(g-1) = \\frac{5}{12} \\cdot 40 \\cdot 39$.\nStep 7:  Simplifying further, we have $g(g-1) = 650$.\nStep 8:  We can solve this quadratic equation to find the value of $g$.\nStep 9:  The quadratic equation $g^2 - g - 650 = 0$ can be factored as $(g-26)(g+25) = 0$.\nStep 10:  This gives us two possible solutions: $g = 26$ or $g = -25$.

In this scenario, all the even numbers on the die are halved. The original even numbers on the die are 2, 4, and 8. After halving, the new even numbers become 1, 2, and 4. The odd numbers, which are 1, 3, and 6, 8, are not affected in this case.\nStep 4:  Now, we need to find the probability of rolling a 2 on the second roll of the die. We can calculate this by considering the probability of each of the two scenarios occurring and then finding the probability of rolling a 2 in each scenario.\nStep 5:  The probability of rolling an odd number on the first roll is $\\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}$, and the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is also $\\frac{1}{2}$.\nStep 6:  In the case where an odd number appears on the top face, the probability of rolling a 2 on the second roll is $\\frac{1}{6}$, as there is only one 2 on the die after doubling the odd numbers.\nStep 7:  In the case where an even number appears on the top face, the probability of rolling a 2 on the second roll is $\\frac{1}{3}$, as there are two 2s on the die after halving the even numbers.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the overall probability of rolling a 2 on the second roll is the sum of the probabilities of each scenario occurring and then rolling a 2 in each scenario, which is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{12} + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{12} + \\frac{2}{12} = \\frac{3}{12} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the number of smaller cubes with no painted faces and the dimensions of the original cube.\nStep 2:  We are given that the cube has edges of length $n$, where $n$ is an integer. When the cube is cut into $n^{3}$ smaller cubes of unit length, we need to find the value of $n$ such that exactly 125 of these smaller cubes have no faces painted red.\nStep 3:  Let's consider the number of smaller cubes with no painted faces. These cubes are located at the corners of the original cube, and there are $n^3 - (n-2)^3$ such cubes. This is because we subtract the number of cubes that have at least one face painted from the total number of cubes.\nStep 4:  We can simplify the expression $n^3 - (n-2)^3$ to get $3n^2 - 6n + 8$. This represents the number of smaller cubes with no painted faces.\nStep 5:  We are given that this number is equal to 125, so we have the equation $3n^2 - 6n + 8 = 125$.\nStep 6:  We can solve for $n$ by rearranging the equation to get $3n^2 - 6n - 117 = 0$.\nStep 7:  Using the quadratic formula, we can find the value of $n$ that satisfies this equation.\nStep 8:  The quadratic formula is given by $n = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the coefficients of the quadratic equation.\nStep 9:  Plugging in the values $a = 3$, $b = -6$, and $c = -117$, we can solve for $n$.\nStep 10:  After solving the quadratic equation, we find that $n = 5$ or $n = -\\frac{13}{3}$.\nStep 11:  Since $n$ must be an integer, we discard the negative solution and conclude that $n = \\boxed{5}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$",
  "Step 1: Let's denote the number of stuffed goats as $g$ and the number of toy helicopters as $h$. We are given that each stuffed goat costs $\\$ 19$ and each toy helicopter costs $\\$ 17$. We also know that Thurka paid a total of $\\$ 201$ for both items. Step 2: We can set up a system of linear equations to represent the given information. The first equation represents the total cost of the stuffed goats, which is $19g$. The second equation represents the total cost of the toy helicopters, which is $17h$. The third equation represents the total cost of both items, which is $19g + 17h = 201$. Step 3: We can solve the system of linear equations using the method of substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method to find the values of $g$ and $h$. Step 4: First, we can multiply the first equation by $17$ to get $17 \\times 19g = 17 \\times 19g$. This gives us $323g = 323g$. Step 5: Next, we can subtract the second equation from the third equation to eliminate the variable $h$. This gives us $19g + 17h - 17h = 201 - 17h$. Simplifying, we get $19g = 201 - 17h$. Step 6: Now, we can substitute the expression for $g$ from the first equation into the equation $19g = 201 - 17h$. This gives us $19 \\times \\frac{201 - 17h}{19} = 201 - 17h$. Simplifying, we get $201 - 17h = 201 - 17h$. Step 7: We can see that the equation $201 - 17h = 201 - 17h$ is an identity, which means that it is true for all values of $h$. This means that we cannot find a unique solution for $h$. However, we can find a solution for $g$ in terms of $h$. Step 8: From the first equation, we have $g = \\frac{201 - 17h}{19}$. Step 9: Since $g$ must be an integer, we can try different values of $h$ to find a corresponding integer value of $g$. Step 10: Let's try $h = 5$.

In this case, the constant term is 3840 and the leading coefficient is 1, so the possible rational roots are the factors of 3840.\n\n## Step 7: Test possible rational roots\nWe can test the possible rational roots by substituting them into the equation and checking if the equation is true. If it is, then that value is a root of the equation.\n\n## Step 8: Find the actual roots of the equation\nAfter testing the possible rational roots, we find that x = -8 is a root of the equation.

  "Step 1:  To find an expression for $g(x)$, we first need to understand the given functions $f(x)$ and $g(f(x))$.\nStep 2:  The function $f(x)$ is defined as $f(x) = 2x + 1$. This means that for any input value of $x$, we multiply it by $2$ and then add $1$ to get the output.\nStep 3:  The function $g(f(x))$ is defined as $g(f(x)) = 4x^2 + 1$. This function takes the output of $f(x)$ as its input and gives a new output.\nStep 4:  We are asked to find an expression for $g(x)$, which means we need to determine the function $g$ in terms of its input $x$.\nStep 5:  To do this, we can use the given expression for $g(f(x))$ and substitute $f(x)$ with its definition to get an expression for $g(x)$ in terms of $x$.\nStep 6:  We start by substituting $f(x) = 2x + 1$ into the expression for $g(f(x)) = 4x^2 + 1$.\nStep 7:  This gives us $g(2x + 1) = 4x^2 + 1$.\nStep 8:  Now, we need to express $g(x)$ in terms of $x$, so we let $y = 2x + 1$ and solve for $x$ in terms of $y$.\nStep 9:  Solving for $x$, we get $x = \\frac{y - 1}{2}$.\nStep 10:  Substituting this expression for $x$ into the equation $g(2x + 1) = 4x^2 + 1$, we get $g(y) = 4 \\left( \\frac{y - 1}{2} \\right)^2 + 1$.\nStep 11:  Simplifying this expression, we get $g(y) = 4 \\left( \\frac{y^2 - 2y + 1}{4} \\right) + 1 = y^2 - 2y + 1 + 1 = y^2 - 2y + 2$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the expression for $g(x)$ is $g(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{x^2 - 2x + 2}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of a geometric sequence and use the given information to find the common ratio and the first term of the sequence.\nStep 2:  Let's denote the first term of the sequence as $a$ and the common ratio as $r$. The sum of the first two terms is given as $a + ar = 40$, and the sum of the first three terms is $a + ar + ar^2 = 76$.\nStep 3:  We can use these equations to find the values of $a$ and $r$. Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us $ar^2 - a = 36$, which simplifies to $a(r^2 - 1) = 36$.\nStep 4:  Similarly, subtracting the second equation from the third gives us $ar^3 - ar = 54$, which simplifies to $a(r^3 - r) = 54$.\nStep 5:  Dividing the equation $a(r^3 - r) = 54$ by $a(r^2 - 1) = 36$ gives us $\\frac{r^3 - r}{r^2 - 1} = \\frac{54}{36}$, which simplifies to $\\frac{r(r^2 - 1)}{r^2 - 1} = \\frac{3}{2}$.\nStep 6:  This further simplifies to $r = \\frac{3}{2}$.\nStep 7:  Now that we have the common ratio, we can find the first term $a$ by substituting $r = \\frac{3}{2}$ into the equation $a(r^2 - 1) = 36$. This gives us $a\\left(\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 - 1\\right) = 36$, which simplifies to $a\\left(\\frac{9}{4} - 1\\right) = 36$.\nStep 8:  Solving for $a$, we get $a\\left(\\frac{5}{4}\\right) = 36$, which gives us $a = \\frac{36 \\cdot 4}{5} = \\frac{144}{5}$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the first term of the sequence is $a = \\frac{144}{5}$, and the common ratio is $r = \\frac{3}{2}$.\nStep 10:  To find the number of terms that are integers, we need to find the terms of the sequence and check if they are integers.\nStep 11:  The terms of the sequence are given by $a, ar, ar^2, ar^3, \\ldots, ar^{19}$.\nStep 12:  We can calculate the values of these terms and check if they are integers.\nStep 13:  The first term is $a = \\frac{144}{5}$, which is not an integer.\nStep 14:  The second term is $ar = \\frac{144}{5} \\cdot \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{432}{10} = \\frac{216}{5}$, which is not an integer.\nStep 15:  The third term is $ar^2 = \\frac{144}{5} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{144}{5} \\cdot \\frac{9}{4} = \\frac{1296}{20} = \\frac{648}{10} = \\frac{324}{5}$, which is not an integer.\nStep 16:  The fourth term is $ar^3 = \\frac{144}{5} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^3 = \\frac{144}{5} \\cdot \\frac{27}{8} = \\frac{3888}{40} = \\frac{972}{10} = \\frac{486}{5}$, which is not an integer.\nStep 17:  The fifth term is $ar^4 = \\frac{144}{5} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^4 = \\frac{144}{5} \\cdot \\frac{81}{16} = \\frac{11664}{80} = \\frac{2916}{20} = \\frac{1458}{10} = \\frac{729}{5}$, which is not an integer.\nStep 18:  The sixth term is $ar^5 = \\frac{144}{5} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^5 = \\frac{144}{5} \\cdot \\frac{243}{32} = \\frac{34992}{160} = \\frac{8730}{40} = \\frac{2193}{10}$, which is not an integer.\nStep 19:  The seventh term is $ar^6 = \\frac{144}{5} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^6 = \\frac{144}{5} \\cdot \\frac{729}{64} = \\frac{104976}{320} = \\frac{26124}{80} = \\frac{6528}{20} = \\frac{3264}{10} = \\frac{1624}{5}$, which is not an integer.\nStep 20:  The eighth term is $ar^7 = \\frac{144}{5} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^7 = \\frac{144}{5} \\cdot \\frac{2187}{128} = \\frac{314928}{640} = \\frac{78522}{160} = \\frac{19655}{40} = \\frac{4938}{10}$, which is not an integer.\nStep 21:  The ninth term is $ar^8 = \\frac{144}{5} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^8 = \\frac{144}{5} \\cdot \\frac{6561}{256} = \\frac{940224}{1280} = \\frac{234056}{320} = \\frac{58514}{80} = \\frac{14653}{20} = \\frac{2931}{4}$, which is not an integer.\nStep 22:  The tenth term is $ar^9 = \\frac{144}{5} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^9 = \\frac{144}{5} \\cdot \\frac{19683}{512} = \\frac{2835392}{2560} = \\frac{706384}{640} = \\frac{176096}{160} = \\frac{44024}{40} = \\frac{11006}{10}$, which is not an integer.\nStep 23:  The eleventh term is $ar^{10} = \\frac{144}{5} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^{10} = \\frac{144}{5} \\cdot \\frac{59049}{1024} = \\frac{8523456}{5120} = \\frac{2133360}{1280} = \\frac{533340}{320} = \\frac{133335}{80} = \\frac{26667}{16}$, which is not an integer.\nStep 24:  The twelfth term is $ar^{11} = \\frac{144}{5} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^{11} = \\frac{144}{5} \\cdot \\frac{177147}{2048} = \\frac{25412208}{10240} = \\frac{6353050}{2560} = \\frac{1583262}{640} = \\frac{395815}{160} = \\frac{98904}{40} = \\frac{24726}{10}$, which is not an integer.\nStep 25:  The thirteenth term is $ar^{12} = \\frac{144}{5} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^{12} = \\frac{144}{5} \\cdot \\frac{531441}{4096} = \\frac{76411616}{20480} = \\frac{19052940}{5120} = \\frac{4763245}{1280} = \\frac{1190811}{320} = \\frac{29852}{80} = \\frac{7463}{20}$, which is not an integer.\nStep 26:  The fourteenth term is $ar^{13} = \\frac{144}{5} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^{13} = \\frac{144}{5} \\cdot \\frac{1594323}{8192} = \\frac{229094592}{40960} = \\frac{56973680}{10240} = \\frac{14218420}{2560} = \\frac{3554605}{640} = \\frac{888652}{160} = \\frac(222663)/40 = \\frac{55666}{10}$, which is not an integer.\nStep 27:  The fifteenth term is $ar^{14} = \\frac{144}{5} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^{14} = \\frac{144}{5} \\cdot \\frac{4782969}{32768} = \\frac{687110656}{163840} = \\frac{171527664}{40960} = \\frac{42881766}{10240} = \\frac(107204",

In other words, $a+b>c$, $a+c>b$, and $b+c>a$. We can use this inequality to find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $T(n)>2010$.\nWe can start by considering the smallest possible values for the side lengths of a triangle. Let $a$, $b$, and $c$ be the side lengths of a triangle. We can assume without loss of generality that $a\\le b\\le c$. Then, by the triangle inequality, we have $a+b>c$, $a+c>b$, and $b+c>a$.

  "Step 1:  To find the 2007th term of the sequence, we need to understand the pattern of how each term is generated from the previous one.\nStep 2:  The first term is given as 2007. To find the second term, we need to calculate the sum of the cubes of the digits of 2007. This means we take each digit of 2007, cube it, and then sum those cubes to get the second term.\nStep 3:  The digits of 2007 are 2, 0, 0, and 7. Cubing each of these gives us $2^3 = 8$, $0^3 = 0$, $0^3 = 0$, and $7^3 = 343$. Summing these gives us $8 + 0 + 0 + 343 = 351$ as the second term.\nStep 4:  Now, we need to find the third term by repeating the process with the second term, 351. The digits of 351 are 3, 5, and 1. Cubing each of these gives us $3^3 = 27$, $5^3 = 125$, and $1^3 = 1$. Summing these gives us $27 + 125 + 1 = 153$ as the third term.\nStep 5:  Continuing this process, we find the fourth term by cubing the digits of 153, which are 1, 5, and 3.

Summing these gives us $1 + 125 + 27 = 153$ as the fourth term.\nStep 6:  We observe that the fourth term is the same as the third term, which means the sequence has entered a loop. This loop will continue indefinitely, and the 2007th term will be the same as the third term, which is 153.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the 2007th term of the sequence is $\\boxed{153}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{153}$",

We are required to find the number of positive integers $n<100000$ for which the length of side $BC$ is also an integer.\nStep 2:  The length of side $BC$ can be found using the Pythagorean Theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. Therefore, we have $BC^2 = AB^2 + AC^2$.\nStep 3:  Substituting the given values, we get $BC^2 = n^2(n+1)^2 + (n+1)^2(n+4)^2$.\nStep 4:  Simplifying this expression, we get $BC^2 = n^2(n+1)^2 + (n+1)^2(n^2+8n+16)$.\nStep 5:  Further simplifying, we get $BC^2 = (n^2+1)(n+1)^2(n^2+8n+16)$.\nStep 6:  For $BC$ to be an integer, $BC^2$ must be a perfect square. This means that $(n^2+1)(n+1)^2(n^2+8n+16)$ must be a perfect square.\nStep 7:  We can factorize $n^2+8n+16$ as $(n+4)^2 - 8$, which is not a perfect square. Therefore, for $BC^2$ to be a perfect square, $(n^2+1)(n+1)^2$ must be a perfect square.\nStep 8:  This implies that $n^2+1$ must be a perfect square, as $(n+1)^2$ is already a perfect square.\nStep 9:  We can express $n^2+1$ as $m^2$, where $m$ is a positive integer.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first understand the properties of a rectangular prism and how its volume and surface area are related to its dimensions.\nStep 2:  Let's denote the length, width, and height of the prism as $l$, $w$, and $h$ respectively. We are given that one face has an area of $27 \\mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ and another face has an area of $32 \\mathrm{~cm}^{2}$.\nStep 3:  We also know that the volume of the prism is $144 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3}$, which can be expressed as the product of its length, width, and height, i.e., $lwh = 144$.\nStep 4:  From the given areas, we can deduce that the dimensions of the prism are $3 \\times 9$ and $4 \\times 9$. This implies that the length and width of the prism are $3$ and $9$ respectively, and the height is $4$.\nStep 5:  Now, we can calculate the surface area of the prism by adding the areas of all its faces. The surface area of a rectangular prism is given by the formula $2lw + 2lh + 2wh$.\nStep 6:  Substituting the values of $l$, $w$, and $h$ into the formula, we get $2(3 \\times 9) + 2(3 \\times 4) + 2(9 \\times 4)$.\nStep 7:  Simplifying this expression, we get $54 + 24 + 72 = 150$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the surface area of the prism is $150 \\mathrm{~cm}^{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{150}$",

Therefore, we have $a=2$.\nStep 7:  The coefficient of $x$ in the first equation is $2a$, and in the second equation, it's $-4h$. Equating these gives us $2a=-4h$, and substituting $a=2$ yields $h=-1$.\nStep 8:  Finally, we can find the value of $k$ by substituting $a=2$ and $h=-1$ into the second equation, which gives us $k=-1$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the values of $a, h,$ and $k$ are $a=2, h=-1,$ and $k=-1$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2, -1, -1}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the properties of an arithmetic sequence and how to represent it mathematically.\nStep 2:  An arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers in which the difference between any two successive members is a constant. This constant difference is called the common difference.\nStep 3:  Let's denote the first term of the sequence as $a$, the common difference as $d$, and the number of terms as $n$. In this case, we have 5 terms, so $n=5$.\nStep 4:  The general formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is given by $a_n = a + (n-1)d$.\nStep 5:  We are given that the first term $a=5$, and we need to find the possible values of the fifth term, which is $a_5$.\nStep 6:  The sum of the squares of the first 3 terms equals the sum of the squares of the last 2 terms. This gives us the equation $a^2 + (a+d)^2 + (a+2d)^2 = (a+4d)^2 + (a+5d)^2$.\nStep 7:  Substituting $a=5$ into the equation, we get $5^2 + (5+d)^2 + (5+2d)^2 = (5+4d)^2 + (5+5d)^2$.\nStep 8:  Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get $25 + 25 + 2d^2 + 10d + d^2 + 20d + 4d^2 = 25 + 100d + 16d^2 + 25 + 50d + 25d^2$.\nStep 9:  Simplifying further, we get $50 + 5d^2 + 30d = 50 + 150d + 41d^2$.\nStep 10:  Rearranging the terms, we get $36d^2 + 120d = 0$.\nStep 11:  Factoring out $12d$, we get $12d(3d+10) = 0$.\nStep 12:  This gives us two possible values for $d$: $d=0$ or $d=-\\frac{10}{3}$.\nStep 13:  If $d=0$, then the sequence is a constant sequence with all terms equal to 5. In this case, the fifth term is also 5.\nStep 14:  If $d=-\\frac{10}{3}$, then the fifth term is $a_5 = a + 4d = 5 + 4(-\\frac{10}{3}) = 5 - \\frac{40}{3} = -\\frac{5}{3}$.\nStep 15:  Therefore, the possible values of the fifth term are 5 and $-\\frac{5}{3}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5, -\\frac{5}{3}}$",

The distance between points $A(1,2)$ and $B(11,2)$ can be found using the distance formula, which is $\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$. In this case, the distance is $\\sqrt{(11 - 1)^2 + (2 - 2)^2} = \\sqrt{100} = 10$.\n## Step 3:  Next, we need to find the distance between points $A(1,2)$ and $C(k,6)$. Using the distance formula again, we get $\\sqrt{(k - 1)^2 + (6 - 2)^2} = \\sqrt{(k - 1)^2 + 16}$.\n## Step 4:  The distance between points $B(11,2)$ and $C(k,6)$ can be found using the distance formula as well, which gives us $\\sqrt{(k - 11)^2 + (6 - 2)^2} = \\sqrt{(k - 11)^2 + 16}$.\n## Step 5:  Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to set up an equation. We know that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, the length of the hypotenuse is the distance between points $A$ and $B$, which is $10$. The other two sides are the distances between points $A$ and $C$, and points $B$ and $C$.\n## Step 6:  So, we have the equation $10^2 = (\\sqrt{(k - 1)^2 + 16})^2 + (\\sqrt{(k - 11)^2 + 16})^2$.\n## Step 7:  Simplifying the equation, we get $100 = (k - 1)^2 + 16 + (k - 11)^2 + 16$.\n## Step 8:  Combining like terms, we have $100 = (k - 1)^2 + (k - 11)^2 + 32$.\n## Step 9:  Expanding the squared terms, we get $100 = k^2 - 2k + 1 + k^2 - 22k + 121 + 32$.\n## Step 10:  Combining like terms, we have $100 = 2k^2 - 24k + 154$.\n## Step 11:  Rearranging the equation, we get $2k^2 - 24k - 54 = 0$.\n## Step 12:  Dividing the entire equation by 2, we get $k^2 - 12k - 27 = 0$.\n## Step 13:  We can solve this quadratic equation by factoring or using the quadratic formula. Factoring gives us $(k - 15)(k + 9/2) = 0$.\n## Step 14:  Setting each factor equal to zero, we get $k - 15 = 0$ or $k + 9/2 = 0$.\n## Step 15:  Solving for $k$, we find $k = 15$ or $k = -9/2$.\n## Step 16:  Therefore, the values of $k$ for which the points $A(1,2), B(11,2)$ and $C(k, 6)$ form a right-angled triangle are $k = 15$ and $k = -9/2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{15}$",

Let's denote the sum as $S$. Then, we can express $S$ as the sum of the individual terms $a_{1}-a_{2}+a_{3}-a_{4}+a_{5}-a_{6}+a_{7}$ over all permutations.\nStep 3:  Now, we need to find the sum of each term $a_{i}$ over all permutations.

This sum can be expressed as the sum of the absolute differences between the numbers in the permutation and their positions.\nStep 4:  We can then use the fact that the sum of the absolute differences between the numbers and their positions is equal to the sum of the absolute differences between the numbers and their positions in the reverse permutation.\nStep 5:  By pairing the terms in the sum, we can see that each pair contributes a value of $1$ to the sum.

This means we are looking for positive even integers $n$ that can be partitioned into three sets $A, B,$ and $C$ such that the sum of the elements in each set is the same, $A$ contains only odd numbers, $B$ contains only even numbers, and $C$ contains every multiple of 3 and possibly other numbers.\n## Step 2:  We start by considering the sum of the elements in each set. Let's denote this common sum as $S$. Since the sum of the elements in each set must be the same, we have $S = \\sum_{i \\in A} i = \\sum_{i \\in B} i = \\sum_{i \\in C} i$.\n## Step 3:  We also know that the sum of the elements in set $C$ is the sum of all multiples of 3 from 1 to $n$, which can be expressed as $\\frac{n(n+2)}{6}$.\n## Step 4:  Additionally, the sum of the elements in set $A$ is the sum of all odd numbers from 1 to $n$, which can be expressed as $\\frac{n^2}{4}$.\n## Step 5:  The sum of the elements in set $B$ is the sum of all even numbers from 2 to $n$, which can be expressed as $\\frac{n(n+2)}{4}$.\n## Step 6:  We can then equate the sum of the elements in set $C$ to the sum of the elements in sets $A$ and $B$, giving us the equation $\\frac{n(n+2)}{6} = \\frac{n^2}{4} + \\frac{n(n+2)}{4}$.\n## Step 7:  Simplifying this equation, we get $n^2 - 2n = 0$, which factors to $n(n-2) = 0$. This gives us two possible values for $n$: $n = 0$ and $n = 2$.\n## Step 8:  However, since we are looking for even savage integers less than 100, we discard $n = 0$ and consider $n = 2$ as a potential solution.\n## Step 9:  We then need to verify if $n = 2$ satisfies the conditions of being a savage integer. We can do this by partitioning the set $\\{1,2\\}$ into three sets $A, B,$ and $C$ such that the sum of the elements in each set is the same, $A$ contains only odd numbers, $B$ contains only even numbers, and $C$ contains every multiple of 3 and possibly other numbers.\n## Step 10:  We find that the sets $A = \\{1\\}$, $B = \\{2\\}$, and $C = \\{3\\}$ satisfy these conditions, making $n = 2$ a valid solution.\n## Step 11:  Next, we need to find all even savage integers less than 100.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand what a prime number is. A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\nStep 2:  We are given two identical dice, each with six faces numbered 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13. We want to find the probability that the sum of the numbers on the top faces of the two dice is a prime number.\nStep 3:  First, let's list all the possible outcomes when rolling the two dice. Since each die has 6 faces, there are a total of $6 \\times 6 = 36$ possible outcomes.\nStep 4:  Next, we need to determine the combinations of dice rolls that result in a prime number sum. The possible sums that are prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.\nStep 5:  We can start by finding the combinations that result in a sum of 2. The only possibility is (2, 0), but since 0 is not a face on the dice, there are no combinations that result in a sum of 2.\nStep 6:  Moving on to a sum of 3, the possible combinations are (3, 0) and (0, 3), but again, 0 is not a face on the dice, so there are no combinations that result in a sum of 3.\nStep 7:  For a sum of 5, the possible combinations are (5, 0), (0, 5), (2, 3), and (3, 2). However, since 0 is not a face on the dice, we can disregard the first two combinations. This leaves us with (2, 3) and (3, 2) as the valid combinations.\nStep 8:  For a sum of 7, the possible combinations are (7, 0), (0, 7), (2, 5), (5, 2), (3, 4), and (4, 3). Again, we can disregard the first two combinations since 0 is not a face on the dice. This leaves us with (2, 5), (5, 2), (3, 4), and (4, 3) as the valid combinations.\nStep 9:  For a sum of 11, the possible combinations are (11, 0), (0, 11), (5, 6), and (6, 5). Disregarding the first two combinations, we are left with (5, 6) and (6, 5) as the valid combinations.\nStep 10:  For a sum of 13, the possible combinations are (13, 0), (0, 13), (11, 2), and (2, 11). Disregarding the first two combinations, we are left with (11, 2) and (2, 11) as the valid combinations.\nStep 11:  Now, we need to count the total number of valid combinations. We have 2 combinations for a sum of 5, 4 combinations for a sum of 7, 2 combinations for a sum of 11, and 2 combinations for a sum of 13. This gives us a total of $2 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 10$ valid combinations.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the probability that the sum of the numbers on the top faces is a prime number is $\\frac{10}{36} = \\frac{5}{18}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{18}}",

However, this would make the original equation undefined, so we discard this solution.\nStep 15:  If $4 \\cos x + 3 \\sin x = 0$, we can solve for $\\sin x$ by isolating it in the equation.\nStep 16:  Dividing both sides by $3$, we get $\\frac{4}{3} \\cos x + \\sin x = 0$.\nStep 17:  Rearranging the terms, we have $\\sin x = -\\frac{4}{3} \\cos x$.\nStep 18:  We can then use the trigonometric identity $\\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x = 1$ to express $\\sin x$ in terms of $\\cos x$.\nStep 19:  Squaring both sides of the equation $\\sin x = -\\frac{4}{3} \\cos x$ gives us $\\sin^2 x = \\frac{16}{9} \\cos^2 x$.\nStep 20:  Substituting this into the identity $\\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x = 1$, we get $\\frac{16}{9} \\cos^2 x + \\cos^2 x = 1$.\nStep 21:  Combining like terms, we have $\\frac{25}{9} \\cos^2 x = 1$.\nStep 22:  Solving for $\\cos^2 x$, we get $\\cos^2 x = \\frac{9}{25}$.\nStep 23:  Taking the square root of both sides, we have $\\cos x = \\pm \\frac{3}{5}$.\nStep 24:  Since $\\sin x = -\\frac{4}{3} \\cos x$, we can substitute the value of $\\cos x$ into this equation to find $\\sin x$.\nStep 25:  If $\\cos x = \\frac{3}{5}$, then $\\sin x = -\\frac{4}{3} \\cdot \\frac{3}{5} = -\\frac{4}{5}$.\nStep 26:  If $\\cos x = -\\frac{3}{5}$, then $\\sin x = -\\frac{4}{3} \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{3}{5}\\right) = \\frac{4}{5}$.\nStep 27:  Therefore, the numerical value of $\\sin x$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{5}}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{4}{5}}$",

If $g(x)=f^{-1}(x)$, then $f(g(x))=x$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f$.\nStep 3:  We are given that $f(x)-g(x)=44$ for all values of $x$. Substituting $g(x)=f^{-1}(x)$ into this equation, we get $f(x)-f^{-1}(x)=44$.\nStep 4:  We can rewrite this equation as $f(x)-x=44$, since $f(f^{-1}(x))=x$.\nStep 5:  This equation can be further simplified to $f(x)=x+44$.

A solid sphere of radius 5 rests in the triangle, being tangent to each of the three sides.\n## Step 3:  Let's denote the points of tangency of the sphere with the sides of length 9 and 12 as A and B, respectively, and the point of tangency with the side of length 15 as C.\n## Step 4:  We can then draw the altitude from the vertex of the right angle (let's call it D) to the side of length 15, which intersects the side at point E.\n## Step 5:  Since the sphere is tangent to each side of the triangle, the line segments AE, BE, and CE are all radii of the sphere and have a length of 5.\n## Step 6:  We can then use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the altitude DE. We have DE^2 + CE^2 = DC^2, where DC is the length of the side of the triangle opposite the right angle.\n## Step 7:  We know that DC = 15, so we can substitute this value into the equation to get DE^2 + 5^2 = 15^2.\n## Step 8:  Solving for DE, we get DE^2 = 225 - 25 = 200, and taking the square root of both sides gives us DE = sqrt(200) = 10*sqrt(2).\n## Step 9:  Now, we need to find the height of the top of the sphere above the plane of the triangle, which is the distance from the center of the sphere to the point where the altitude intersects the side of length 15.\n## Step 10:  This distance is equal to the radius of the sphere, which is 5, plus the length of the altitude DE.\n## Step 11:  Therefore, the height of the top of the sphere above the plane of the triangle is 5 + 10*sqrt(2).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5 + 10\\sqrt{2}}",
  "Step 1: To find the measure of angle A C B, we can use the Law of Cosines, which relates the lengths of the sides of a triangle to the cosine of one of its angles.\nStep 2: First, we need to find the lengths of the sides of the triangle. We can do this using the distance formula, which is derived from the Pythagorean theorem.\nStep 3: The distance formula is given by: d = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2), where (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are the coordinates of the two points.\nStep 4: Using this formula, we can find the lengths of the sides AB, BC, and AC.\nStep 5: The length of AB is sqrt((3 - 0)^2 + (0 - 5)^2) = sqrt(9 + 25) = sqrt(34).\nStep 6: The length of BC is sqrt((8 - 3)^2 + (3 - 0)^2) = sqrt(25 + 9) = sqrt(34).\nStep 7: The length of AC is sqrt((8 - 0)^2 + (3 - 5)^2) = sqrt(64 + 4) = sqrt(68).\nStep 8: Now that we have the lengths of the sides, we can use the Law of Cosines to find the measure of angle A C B.\nStep 9: The Law of Cosines states that c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab * cos(C), where c is the length of the side opposite angle C, and a and b are the lengths of the other two sides.\nStep 10: In this case, we can let a = AB, b = BC, and c = AC.\nStep 11: Plugging in the values we found earlier, we get: (sqrt(68))^2 = (sqrt(34))^2 + (sqrt(34))^2 - 2 * sqrt(34) * sqrt(34) * cos(C).\nStep 12: Simplifying this equation, we get: 68 = 34 + 34 - 2 * 34 * cos(C).\nStep 13: Combining like terms, we get: 68 = 68 - 68 * cos(C).\nStep 14: Subtracting 68 from both sides, we get: 0 = -68 * cos(C).\nStep 15: Dividing both sides by -68, we get: cos(C) = 0.\nStep 16: The cosine of an angle is 0 when the angle is 90 degrees.\nStep 17: Therefore, the measure of angle A C B is 90 degrees.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{90}",

We are also given that the probability of each of them winning 3 of the 6 games is $\\frac{5}{16}$.\nStep 2:  The question asks for the probability that Blaise will win more games than Pierre. This means we need to find the probability of Blaise winning 4, 5, or 6 games out of the 6 games played.\nStep 3:  To approach this, we can use the concept of complementary probability. This means we will find the probability of the event we are interested in (Blaise winning more games than Pierre) by subtracting the probability of the event we are not interested in (Blaise winning the same number of games as Pierre) from 1.\nStep 4:  The probability of Blaise and Pierre winning the same number of games is given as $\\frac{5}{16}$, which is the probability of each of them winning 3 games.\nStep 5:  Therefore, the probability of Blaise winning more games than Pierre is $1 - \\frac{5}{16}$.\nStep 6:  We can calculate this as $1 - \\frac{5}{16} = \\frac{16}{16} - \\frac{5}{16} = \\frac{11}{16}$.\nStep 7:  So, the probability that Blaise will win more games than Pierre is $\\frac{11}{16}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{11}{16}}$",

In the context of the triangle, this means that the side lengths can be represented as $a-d, a, a+d$, where $a$ is the middle side length and $d$ is the common difference between consecutive terms.\nStep 3:  Given that one side length is 60, we can express the other two side lengths as $60-d$ and $60+d$. Since the side lengths form an arithmetic sequence, we have the equation $60-d = a-d$ and $60+d = a+d$.\nStep 4:  Solving these equations, we find that $a = 60$ and $d = 0$. This implies that the side lengths of the triangle are 60, 60, and 60, which is not a valid right-angled triangle.\nStep 5:  However, we also have the possibility that the side lengths are $60-d, 60, 60+d$.

We can solve the second part of the equation for $y$ by rearranging the terms: $y = \\frac{5}{2}+x$.\n\nStep 4: Find the pairs (x, y) that satisfy both equations\nNow we have two expressions for $x^2$ and $y$. We can substitute the expression for $y$ into the expression for $x^2$ to get $x^2 = \\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{\\frac{5}{2}+x}{2}$. Simplifying this expression, we get $x^2 = \\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{5}{4}+\\frac{x}{2}$, which simplifies to $x^2 = \\frac{6}{4}+\\frac{x}{2}$, or $x^2 = \\frac{3}{2}+\\frac{x}{2}$.\n\nStep 5: Solve for x\nWe can solve for $x$ by rearranging the equation: $x^2 - \\frac{x}{2} - \\frac{3}{2} = 0$. This is a quadratic equation in $x$, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula: $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. In this case, $a = 1$, $b = -\\frac{1}{2}$, and $c = -\\frac{3}{2}$. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get $x = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 - 4(1)\\left(-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)}}{2(1)}$.\n\nStep 6: Simplify the expression for x\nSimplifying the expression under the square root, we get $x = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4} + 6}}{2}$. This simplifies to $x = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{25}{4}}}{2}$, which further simplifies to $x = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} \\pm \\frac{5}{2}}{2}$.\n\nStep 7: Solve for x\nWe can solve for $x$ by simplifying the expression: $x = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} \\pm \\frac{5}{2}}{2}$. This gives us two possible values for $x$: $x = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{5}{2}}{2}$ and $x = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{5}{2}}{2}$.\n\nStep 8: Simplify the expressions for x\nSimplifying the expressions for $x$, we get $x = \\frac{\\frac{6}{2}}{2}$ and $x = \\frac{-\\frac{4}{2}}{2}$. This simplifies to $x = \\frac{3}{2}$ and $x = -1$.\n\nStep 9: Find the corresponding values of y\nNow that we have the values of $x$, we can find the corresponding values of $y$ by substituting $x$ into the expression for $y$: $y = \\frac{5}{2}+x$. For $x = \\frac{3}{2}$, we get $y = \\frac{5}{2}+\\frac{3}{2} = 4$. For $x = -1$, we get $y = \\frac{5}{2}-1 = \\frac{3}{2}$.\n\nStep 10: Write the final answer\nThe pairs $(x, y)$ that satisfy the system of equations are $(\\frac{3}{2}, 4)$ and $(-1, \\frac{3}{2})$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",

Since each letter can be either $A$ or $B$, there are $2^{10} = 1024$ possible strings.\n## Step 3:  Now, we need to find the number of strings that include the consecutive letters $A B B A$. To do this, we can consider the different positions where the sequence $A B B A$ can appear in the string.\n## Step 4:  We can start by considering the case where the sequence $A B B A$ appears at the beginning of the string. In this case, the remaining six letters can be any combination of $A$ and $B$, giving us $2^6 = 64$ possible strings.\n## Step 5:  Next, we consider the case where the sequence $A B B A$ appears in the second position. In this case, the first letter must be $A$, and the remaining seven letters can be any combination of $A$ and $B$, giving us $2^7 = 128$ possible strings.\n## Step 6:  Similarly, we consider the case where the sequence $A B B A$ appears in the third position. In this case, the first two letters must be $A A$, and the remaining six letters can be any combination of $A$ and $B$, giving us $2^6 = 64$ possible strings.\n## Step 7:  Finally, we consider the case where the sequence $A B B A$ appears in the fourth position. In this case, the first three letters must be $A A A$, and the remaining five letters can be any combination of $A$ and $B$, giving us $2^5 = 32$ possible strings.\n## Step 8:  However, we need to be careful not to overcount the strings that include the consecutive letters $A B B A$ in multiple positions. To avoid this, we can use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion.\n## Step 9:  By applying the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion, we can find the total number of strings that include the consecutive letters $A B B A$ by adding the number of strings in each case and then subtracting the number of strings that are counted multiple times.\n## Step 10:  After applying the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion, we find that the total number of strings that include the consecutive letters $A B B A$ is $64 + 128 + 64 + 32 - 32 - 32 - 32 = 224$.\n## Step 11:  Therefore, the total number of strings of ten letters, each of which is $A$ or $B$, that do not include the consecutive letters $A B B A$ is $1024 - 224 = \\boxed{800}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{800}$",

In this case, the other number must be one of the numbers $1$ through $9$. Since each number is equally likely to be chosen, the probability of choosing $10$ is $\\frac{1}{k}$, and the probability of choosing any of the numbers $1$ through $9$ is $\\frac{9}{k}$.\nStep 3:  Therefore, the probability that the product is divisible by $10$ because one of the numbers chosen is $10$ is $\\frac{1}{k} \\cdot \\frac{9}{k} = \\frac{9}{k^2}$.\nStep 4:  Next, we consider the case where the product is divisible by $10$ because one of the numbers chosen is $5$ and the other is even. The probability of choosing $5$ is $\\frac{1}{k}$, and the probability of choosing an even number is $\\frac{k/2}{k} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nStep 5:  Therefore, the probability that the product is divisible by $10$ because one of the numbers chosen is $5$ and the other is even is $\\frac{1}{k} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2k}$.\nStep 6:  Now, we need to find the total probability $P(10)$, which is the sum of the probabilities of these two cases.\nStep 7:  Therefore, $P(10) = \\frac{9}{k^2} + \\frac{1}{2k}$.\nStep 8:  We are given that $k \\geq 2$, so we can substitute $k = 10$ into the expression for $P(10)$ to find the final probability.\nStep 9:  Substituting $k = 10$ into the expression for $P(10)$ gives us $P(10) = \\frac{9}{10^2} + \\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 10} = \\frac{9}{100} + \\frac{1}{20} = \\frac{9}{100} + \\frac{5}{100} = \\frac{14}{100} = \\frac{7}{50}$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{50}}$",

This means that $a+b+c=24$.\nStep 3:  To find the number of possible combinations of $a$, $b$, and $c$ that satisfy this condition, we can use the concept of combinations with repetition. We need to find the number of ways to distribute 24 identical items (the sum of the digits) into 3 distinct boxes (the digits $a$, $b$, and $c$).\nStep 4:  This can be represented as a stars and bars problem, where we have 24 stars (representing the sum of the digits) and 2 bars (representing the separation between the digits). The number of ways to arrange these stars and bars is given by the combination formula $\\binom{n+k-1}{k-1}$, where $n$ is the number of stars and $k$ is the number of boxes.\nStep 5:  In this case, we have 24 stars and 3 boxes, so the number of ways to arrange them is $\\binom{24+3-1}{3-1} = \\binom{26}{2}$.\nStep 6:  However, we need to consider the constraint that $a$, $b$, and $c$ are digits, so they must be between 0 and 9.

  "Step 1:  The given equation involves logarithmic functions, so the first step is to simplify the equation by using the properties of logarithms.\nStep 2:  We start by isolating the logarithmic terms on one side of the equation. This gives us $2 \\log _{2}(x-1) + \\log _{2}(x+2) = 1$.\nStep 3:  Using the property of logarithms that states $\\log _{a}(b) + \\log _{a}(c) = \\log _{a}(b \\cdot c)$, we can combine the two logarithmic terms on the left-hand side to get $\\log _{2}((x-1)(x+2)) = 1$.\nStep 4:  Next, we can rewrite the equation in exponential form by raising $2$ to the power of both sides. This gives us $2^{\\log _{2}((x-1)(x+2))} = 2^1$, which simplifies to $(x-1)(x+2) = 2$.\nStep 5:  Expanding the left-hand side of the equation, we get $x^2 + x - 2 = 2$.\nStep 6:  Rearranging the terms, we have $x^2 + x - 4 = 0$.\nStep 7:  To solve for $x$, we can use the quadratic formula, which states that for an equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the solutions are given by $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.\nStep 8:  Applying the quadratic formula to our equation, we get $x = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^2 - 4(1)(-4)}}{2(1)}$.\nStep 9:  Simplifying under the square root, we have $x = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{17}}{2}$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the solutions to the equation are $x = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{17}}{2}$ and $x = \\frac{-1 - \\sqrt{17}}{2}$.\nStep 11:  However, we need to check if these solutions satisfy the original equation and are valid in the context of the logarithmic functions involved.\nStep 12:  We need to ensure that $x-1>0$ and $x+2>0$ for the logarithmic functions to be defined.\nStep 13:  This means that $x>1$ and $x>-2$, which implies that $x>1$ is the only restriction.\nStep 14:  Therefore, the valid solution is $x = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{17}}{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{17}}{2}}$",

Applying this formula, we get $\\sin \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{3}{2} \\sin x\\right) = \\sin \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\frac{3}{2} \\cos x\\right)$.\nStep 4:  Equating the arguments of the sine functions, we obtain the equation $\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{3}{2} \\sin x = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\frac{3}{2} \\cos x$.\nStep 5:  Simplifying this equation, we get $-\\frac{3}{2} \\sin x = \\frac{3}{2} \\cos x$, which further simplifies to $\\tan x = -1$.\nStep 6:  Since $0 < x < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, the solutions to $\\tan x = -1$ in this interval are $x = \\frac{3 \\pi}{4}$.\nStep 7:  Now, we need to find the possible values of $\\sin 2x$. We can use the double-angle identity for sine, which states that $\\sin 2x = 2 \\sin x \\cos x$.\nStep 8:  Substituting $x = \\frac{3 \\pi}{4}$ into the double-angle identity, we get $\\sin 2x = 2 \\sin \\frac{3 \\pi}{4} \\cos \\frac{3 \\pi}{4}$.\nStep 9:  Evaluating the sine and cosine values, we find that $\\sin \\frac{3 \\pi}{4} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ and $\\cos \\frac{3 \\pi}{4} = -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$.\nStep 10:  Substituting these values into the expression for $\\sin 2x$, we get $\\sin 2x = 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right) = -\\frac{2}{2} = -1$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the possible value of $\\sin 2x$ is $\\boxed{-1}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-1}$",

The least common multiple of $5$, $2$, and $10$ is $10$. Therefore, we can rewrite each fraction with a denominator of $10$.\nStep 6:  The first fraction $\\frac{2}{5}$ becomes $\\frac{2 \\cdot 2}{5 \\cdot 2} = \\frac{4}{10}$. The second fraction $\\frac{5}{2}$ becomes $\\frac{5 \\cdot 5}{2 \\cdot 5} = \\frac{25}{10}$.

Therefore, the sum of the fractions is $\\frac{30}{10}$.\nStep 9:  We can simplify $\\frac{30}{10}$ by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $10$. This gives us $\\frac{30 \\div 10}{10 \\div 10} = \\frac{3}{1}$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the value of $f(2,5)$ is $\\frac{3}{1}$, which simplifies to $3$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$",

Substituting n = 1 into the expression for $S_{n}$, we get $S_{1}=555(1)-7(1)^{2}=548$, which is positive.\n\nStep 19: Therefore, the smallest value of n for which $S_{n}<0$ is actually n = 40.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{40}$",

Substituting $y = \\frac{8(x - 1)}{x}$ into the second equation gives us $x^2 - 8x + \\frac{8(x - 1)}{x} = 0$.\nStep 5:  Multiplying through by $x$ to clear the fraction, we get $x^3 - 8x^2 + 8x - 8 = 0$.\nStep 6:  We can factor the equation $x^3 - 8x^2 + 8x - 8 = 0$ to find the values of $x$ that satisfy the equation.\nStep 7:  Factoring the equation gives us $(x - 2)(x^2 - 6x + 4) = 0$.\nStep 8:  Setting each factor equal to zero, we get $x - 2 = 0$ and $x^2 - 6x + 4 = 0$.\nStep 9:  Solving $x - 2 = 0$ gives us $x = 2$.\nStep 10:  To solve $x^2 - 6x + 4 = 0$, we can use the quadratic formula $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a = 1$, $b = -6$, and $c = 4$.\nStep 11:  Plugging in the values into the quadratic formula, we get $x = \\frac{-(-6) \\pm \\sqrt{(-6)^2 - 4(1)(4)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{36 - 16}}{2} = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{20}}{2} = \\frac{6 \\pm 2\\sqrt{5}}{2} = 3 \\pm \\sqrt{5}$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the solutions for $x$ are $x = 2$, $x = 3 + \\sqrt{5}$, and $x = 3 - \\sqrt{5}$.\nStep 13:  Now that we have the values of $x$, we can substitute them back into the expression for $y$ to find the corresponding values of $y$.\nStep 14:  For $x = 2$, we have $y = \\frac{8(2 - 1)}{2} = \\frac{8}{2} = 4$.\nStep 15:  For $x = 3 + \\sqrt{5}$, we have $y = \\frac{8((3 + \\sqrt{5}) - 1)}{3 + \\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{8(2 + \\sqrt{5})}{3 + \\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{16 + 8\\sqrt{5}}{3 + \\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{(16 + 8\\sqrt{5})(3 - \\sqrt{5})}{(3 + \\sqrt{5})(3 - \\sqrt{5})} = \\frac{48 - 16\\sqrt{5} + 24\\sqrt{5} - 40}{9 - 5} = \\frac{8 + 8\\sqrt{5}}{4} = 2 + 2\\sqrt{5}$.\nStep 16:  For $x = 3 - \\sqrt{5}$, we have $y = \\frac{8((3 - \\sqrt{5}) - 1)}{3 - \\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{8(2 - \\sqrt{5})}{3 - \\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{16 - 8\\sqrt{5}}{3 - \\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{(16 - 8\\sqrt{5})(3 + \\sqrt{5})}{(3 - \\sqrt{5})(3 + \\sqrt{5})} = \\frac{48 + 16\\sqrt{5} - 24\\sqrt{5} - 40}{9 - 5} = \\frac{8 - 8\\sqrt{5}}{4} = 2 - 2\\sqrt{5}$.\nStep 17:  Therefore, the solutions to the system of equations are $(2, 4)$, $(3 + \\sqrt{5}, 2 + 2\\sqrt{5})$, and $(3 - \\sqrt{5}, 2 - 2\\sqrt{5})$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\left( 2, \\  4\\right)}",

We need to use this information to determine the value of $A_{4}$.\nStep 3:  The problem states that for each integer $k$, the entry $A_{k}$ is the average of the entry to its left, the entry to its right, and the entry below it. This means that $A_{k} = \\frac{A_{k-1} + A_{k+1} + B_{k}}{3}$.\nStep 4:  Similarly, each entry $B_{k}$ is the average of the entry to its left, the entry to its right, and the entry above it, so $B_{k} = \\frac{A_{k-1} + A_{k} + B_{k-1}}{3}$.\nStep 5:  We can use these relationships to find the values of $B_{0}$, $B_{1}$, and $B_{2}$, and then use them to calculate $A_{4}$.\nStep 6:  First, we find $B_{0}$ using the given values of $A_{0}$ and $A_{1}$.

  "Problem: Determine the coordinates of the points of intersection of the graphs of $y=\\log _{10}(x-2)$ and $y=1-\\log _{10}(x+1)$. Step 1: To find the points of intersection, we need to set the two equations equal to each other and solve for x. This is because at the points of intersection, the y-values of the two graphs will be the same. Step 2: Set the two equations equal to each other: $\\log _{10}(x-2)=1-\\log _{10}(x+1)$. Step 3: Use the properties of logarithms to simplify the equation. We can rewrite $1-\\log _{10}(x+1)$ as $\\log _{10}\\left(\\frac{10}{x+1}\\right)$. So the equation becomes $\\log _{10}(x-2)=\\log _{10}\\left(\\frac{10}{x+1}\\right)$. Step 4: Since the bases of the logarithms are the same, we can equate the expressions inside the logarithms: $x-2=\\frac{10}{x+1}$. Step 5: Multiply both sides of the equation by $(x+1)$ to eliminate the fraction: $(x-2)(x+1)=10$. Step 6: Expand the left side of the equation: $x^{2}-x-2=10$. Step 7: Add $x$ and $2$ to both sides of the equation to get $x^{2}=12$. Step 8: Take the square root of both sides of the equation to solve for x: $x=\\pm \\sqrt{12}$. Step 9: Simplify the square root: $x=\\pm 2 \\sqrt{3}$. Step 10: Now that we have the x-coordinates of the points of intersection, we can substitute them into either of the original equations to find the corresponding y-coordinates. Let's use the first equation: $y=\\log _{10}(x-2)$. Step 11: Substitute $x=2 \\sqrt{3}$ into the equation: $y=\\log _{10}\\left(2 \\sqrt{3}-2\\right)$. Step 12: Simplify the expression inside the logarithm: $y=\\log _{10}\\left(2(\\sqrt{3}-1)\\right)$. Step 13: Use the properties of logarithms to simplify the expression: $y=\\log _{10} 2+\\log _{10}\\left(\\sqrt{3}-1\\right)$. Step 14: Use a calculator to find the values of the logarithms: $y \\approx 0.3010+0.1461 \\approx 0.4471$. Step 15: Now that we have the y-coordinate, we can write the coordinates of the point of intersection: $\\left(2 \\sqrt{3}, 0.4471\\right)$. Step 16: Repeat the process for the other x-coordinate: $x=-2 \\sqrt{3}$. Step 17: Substitute $x=-2 \\sqrt{3}$ into the equation: $y=\\log _{10}\\left(-2 \\sqrt{3}-2\\right)$. Step 18: Simplify the expression inside the logarithm: $y=\\log _{10}\\left(-2(\\sqrt{3}+1)\\right)$. Step 19: Use the properties of logarithms to simplify the expression: $y=\\log _{10}(-2)+\\log _{10}\\left(\\sqrt{3}+1\\right)$. Step 20: Use a calculator to find the values of the logarithms: $y \\approx-0.3010+0.1461 \\approx-0.1549$.

This gives us 4 possible positions for Bobby (3rd, 4th, 5th, or 6th).\nStep 4:  The third restriction is that Marcia must be ahead of Jan, which means that Jan cannot be in the first, second, or third position.

Therefore, we need to find the greatest integer $k$ such that $k!$ and $(1000-k)!$ have fewer than 164 factors of 7.\nStep 8:  We can use the fact that the number of factors of 7 in $n!$ is given by $e_7(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{7} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{7^2} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{7^3} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{7^4} \\right\\rfloor$.\nStep 9:  By analyzing the values of $e_7(k)$ and $e_7(1000-k)$, we can determine the range of values for $k$ that satisfy the condition.\nStep 10:  After analyzing the values, we find that the greatest integer $k \\leq 1000$ such that $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}1000 \\\\ k\\end{array}\\right)$ is a multiple of 7 is $\\boxed{686}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{686}$",

Since each resident knows how to make exactly two dishes, and no two residents know how to make the same pair of dishes, each pair of residents knows how to make a unique dish. Therefore, the number of pairs of residents who know how to make a common dish is equal to the number of dishes, which is $d$.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where $k>2$. In this case, we need to find the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length $k$. We can construct a resident cycle by choosing a resident, then choosing a dish that the resident knows how to make, then choosing another resident who knows how to make the same dish, and so on. Since each resident knows how to make exactly two dishes, and no two residents know how to make the same pair of dishes, each resident can be chosen in at most two ways.\n\nLet's consider the number of ways to choose the first resident. There are $\\binom{d}{1}$ ways to choose a dish, and for each dish, there are $\\binom{d-1}{1}$ ways to choose a resident who knows how to make that dish. Therefore, the total number of ways to choose the first resident is $\\binom{d}{1} \\cdot \\binom{d-1}{1} = d(d-1)$.\n\nNow, let's consider the number of ways to choose the second resident. Since the second resident must know how to make the same dish as the first resident, there are $\\binom{d-2}{1}$ ways to choose the second resident.\n\nWe can continue this process, choosing the third resident, the fourth resident, and so on, until we have chosen $k$ residents. At each step, we have $\\binom{d-i}{1}$ ways to choose the next resident, where $i$ is the number of residents already chosen.\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinguishable resident cycles of length $k$ is:\n\n$$\\binom{d}{1} \\cdot \\binom{d-1}{1} \\cdot \\binom{d-2}{1} \\cdots \\binom{d-k+1}{1} = \\frac{d!}{(d-k)!}$$\n\nHowever, this expression counts each cycle multiple times, since the order of the residents in the cycle does not matter. To correct for this, we need to divide by the number of ways to arrange the $k$ residents in a cycle, which is $k$.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n$$\\frac{d!}{(d-k)!k}$$\n\nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{\\frac{d!}{(d-k)!k}}",

We also know that $a_{20}+b_{14}=1000$.\nStep 3:  Let's start by understanding the properties of arithmetic sequences. In an arithmetic sequence, each term is obtained by adding a fixed constant to the previous term. This constant is called the common difference.\nStep 4:  We are asked to find the least possible value for $b_{20}+a_{14}$. To do this, we need to consider the relationship between the terms in the two sequences and use the given information to derive a relationship between $b_{20}$ and $a_{14}$.\nStep 5:  We can start by considering the terms $a_{20}$ and $b_{14}$. Since $a_{20}+b_{14}=1000$, we can express $b_{14}$ as $1000-a_{20}$.\nStep 6:  Now, we need to find the relationship between $b_{20}$ and $a_{14}$.

Our goal is to find the values of $x$, $y$, and $z$ that satisfy these equations and are the farthest from the origin.\nStep 3:  We can start by manipulating the given equations to simplify them and make them easier to work with. By adding $x$ to both sides of the first equation, we get $xy + x = z^2 + 14$. Similarly, by adding $y^2z$ to both sides of the second equation, we get $xy + y^2z = x + 14$.\nStep 4:  Subtracting the second equation from the first, we obtain $x(y - 1) - y^2z = z^2 - 14$. This equation can be further simplified to $x(y - 1) - y^2z = (z - 7)(z + 7)$.\nStep 5:  We can then factorize the equation to get $(z - 7)(z + 7) = x(y - 1) - y^2z$. This factorization helps us to identify the possible values of $z$ and $x$ that satisfy the equation.\nStep 6:  We find that $z = 7$ is a solution to the equation, and when $z = 7$, we can solve for $x$ and $y$ using the given equations.\nStep 7:  Substituting $z = 7$ into the first equation, we get $xy - 49 = 14$, which simplifies to $xy = 63$.

We can then use these values to find the corresponding value of $z$.\nStep 9:  By substituting $x = 7$ and $y = 9$ into the first equation, we get $63 - 49 = 14$, which is true. Therefore, the ordered triple $(x, y, z)$ representing the farthest lattice point from the origin that satisfies the given equations is $(7, 9, 7)$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the ordered triple $(x, y, z)$ representing the farthest lattice point from the origin that satisfies the given equations is $\\boxed{(7, 9, 7)}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(7, 9, 7)}$",

We are asked to find the smallest positive integral value of $K$ such that the absolute value of the difference between $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$ is greater than or equal to $15 T$.\nStep 2:  The absolute value of a complex number $a+bi$ is given by $\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$. So, we need to find the absolute value of the difference between $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$, which is $\\left|z_{1}-z_{2}\\right|$.\nStep 3:  We can calculate this by finding the difference between $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$, which is $(15+5 i)-(1+K i)$, and then taking the absolute value of the result.\nStep 4:  This simplifies to $\\left|(15-1)+(5-K) i\\right| = \\sqrt{(14)^{2}+(5-K)^{2}}$.\nStep 5:  We are given that this absolute value must be greater than or equal to $15 T$, so we have the inequality $\\sqrt{(14)^{2}+(5-K)^{2}} \\geq 15 \\cdot \\frac{8}{5}$.\nStep 6:  Squaring both sides of the inequality, we get $(14)^{2}+(5-K)^{2} \\geq (15 \\cdot \\frac{8}{5})^{2}$.\nStep 7:  Simplifying this, we have $196+(5-K)^{2} \\geq 144$, which further simplifies to $(5-K)^{2} \\geq -52$.\nStep 8:  Since the square of any real number is non-negative, the inequality $(5-K)^{2} \\geq -52$ is always true for any real number $K$.\nStep 9:  However, we are asked to find the smallest positive integral value of $K$, so we need to find the smallest positive integer value of $K$ that satisfies the inequality.\nStep 10:  Since the inequality is always true for any real number $K$, the smallest positive integral value of $K$ is simply the smallest positive integer, which is $\\boxed{1}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

This can be broken down into two cases: Charlie being next to Chris, and Charlie being next to Abby.\nStep 3:  In the first case, we can consider Charlie and Chris as a single unit, and then there are $T-1$ people left to arrange, including Abby. This gives us $(T-1)!$ ways to arrange the people. However, within the unit of Charlie and Chris, there are $2$ ways to arrange them, so we have $2(T-1)!$ ways for Charlie to be next to Chris.\nStep 4:  Similarly, in the second case, we consider Charlie and Abby as a single unit, and there are again $T-1$ people left to arrange, giving us $(T-1)!$ ways to arrange the people. Again, within the unit of Charlie and Abby, there are $2$ ways to arrange them, so we have $2(T-1)!$ ways for Charlie to be next to Abby.\nStep 5:  However, we have counted the scenarios where Charlie is next to both Chris and Abby twice, so we need to subtract these cases once to avoid double counting.\nStep 6:  Therefore, the total number of ways Charlie can be standing next to at least one of Chris or Abby is $2(T-1)! + 2(T-1)! - 2(T-2)!$.\nStep 7:  Finally, we can calculate the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes, which is $\\frac{2(T-1)! + 2(T-1)! - 2(T-2)!}{T!}$.\nStep 8:  Substituting $T=25$, we get $\\frac{2(24!)+2(24!)-2(23!)}{25!}$.\nStep 9:  Simplifying this expression, we get $\\frac{4(24!)-2(23!)}{25!}$.\nStep 10:  Further simplifying, we get $\\frac{4(24!)}{25!}-\\frac{2(23!)}{25!}$.\nStep 11:  This simplifies to $\\frac{4}{25}-\\frac{2}{25}$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the probability that Charlie is standing next to at least one of Chris or Abby is $\\frac{2}{25}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{25}}$",

Therefore, we need to add a factor of $2^3$ to $y$ to make the exponent of 2 at least 3.\nStep 14:  The exponent of 3 in the prime factorization of $3 \\cdot 11^2$ is 1, which is less than the exponent of 3 in the prime factorization of 1584, which is 2. Therefore, we need to add a factor of $3^1$ to $y$ to make the exponent of 3 at least 2.\nStep 15:  The exponent of 11 in the prime factorization of $3 \\cdot 11^2$ is 2, which is equal to the exponent of 11 in the prime factorization of 1584. Therefore, we don't need to add any factor of 11 to $y$.\nStep 16:  Therefore, the smallest positive integer $y$ such that $x y$ is a multiple of 1584 is $y = 2^3 \\cdot 3^1 = 24$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{24}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the given function $f$ and its impact on the sequence $s_n$.\nStep 2:  The function $f$ is defined as a mapping from the set $S = \\{1, 2, \\ldots, 20\\}$ to itself. This means that for any input $s$ from the set $S$, the function $f$ will output a value that is also in the set $S$.\nStep 3:  The sequence $s_n$ is defined as the sum of the function $f$ applied $n$ times to each element in the set $S$.

  "Step 1:  To solve the given expression, we first need to understand the properties of logarithms and exponents.\nStep 2:  The expression $2^{\\log _{T} 8}-8^{\\log _{T} 2}$ involves logarithms and exponents, so we'll start by simplifying the logarithmic terms using the properties of logarithms.\nStep 3:  We know that $\\log _{a} b = c$ is equivalent to $a^c = b$. Using this property, we can rewrite the given expression as $2^{\\log _{T} 8}-8^{\\log _{T} 2} = 2^{\\log _{T} 8} - 8^{\\log _{T} 2}$.\nStep 4:  Now, we can use the property of logarithms that states $\\log _{a} b^c = c \\log _{a} b$. Applying this property, we get $\\log _{T} 8 = \\log _{T} (2^3) = 3 \\log _{T} 2$.\nStep 5:  Similarly, we have $\\log _{T} 2 = \\log _{T} (2^1) = 1 \\log _{T} 2 = \\log _{T} 2$.\nStep 6:  Substituting these values back into the expression, we get $2^{\\log _{T} 8} - 8^{\\log _{T} 2} = 2^{3 \\log _{T} 2} - 8^{\\log _{T} 2}$.\nStep 7:  Now, we can simplify the exponents using the property $a^{\\log _{a} b} = b$. This gives us $2^{3 \\log _{T} 2} = (2^{\\log _{T} 2})^3 = T^3$ and $8^{\\log _{T} 2} = (2^3)^{\\log _{T} 2} = 2^{3 \\log _{T} 2} = T^3$.\nStep 8:  Substituting these values back into the expression, we get $T^3 - T^3$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",
  "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Define the variables and the given information\nLet's denote the number of traffic warnings issued as $T+2$, the number of tickets issued as 20, and the number of arrests made as $T+5$. We are also given that the combined number of tickets and arrests should be 20 times the number of warnings issued.\n\n## Step 2: Write an equation representing the given information\nThe combined number of tickets and arrests is $(T+2) + (T+5) = 2T + 7$. This should be equal to 20 times the number of warnings issued, which is $20(T+2) = 20T + 40$.\n\n## Step 3: Set up the equation to solve for T\nWe can set up the equation $2T + 7 = 20T + 40$ to solve for T.\n\n## Step 4: Solve the equation for T\nSubtracting $2T$ from both sides of the equation gives $7 = 18T + 40$. Subtracting 40 from both sides gives $-33 = 18T$. Dividing both sides by 18 gives $T = -\\frac{33}{18} = -\\frac{11}{6}$.\n\n## Step 5: Find the number of tickets that must be issued\nSince the number of tickets issued is 20, and we need to find how many more tickets must be issued, we can set up the equation $20 + x = 20T + 40$, where x is the number of additional tickets that must be issued.\n\n## Step 6: Solve for x\nSubstituting $T = -\\frac{11}{6}$ into the equation gives $20 + x = 20(-\\frac{11}{6}) + 40$. Simplifying the right-hand side gives $20 + x = -\\frac{220}{6} + 40$. Converting 40 to a fraction with a denominator of 6 gives $20 + x = -\\frac{220}{6} + \\frac{240}{6}$. Combining the fractions gives $20 + x = \\frac{20}{6}$. Subtracting 20 from both sides gives $x = \\frac{20}{6} - 20$. Converting 20 to a fraction with a denominator of 6 gives $x = \\frac{20}{6} - \\frac{120}{6}$. Combining the fractions gives $x = -\\frac{100}{6}$.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the answer\nWe can simplify the answer by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2. This gives $x = -\\frac{50}{3}$.\n\n## Step 8: Convert the answer to a positive number\nSince we are looking for the number of additional tickets that must be issued, we can convert the answer to a positive number by taking the absolute value. This gives $x = \\frac{50}{3}$.\n\n## Step 9: Convert the answer to a whole number\nSince we cannot issue a fraction of a ticket, we can round up to the nearest whole number. However, the problem asks for the number of additional tickets that must be issued, so we can simply take the ceiling of the answer. This gives $x = \\lceil \\frac{50}{3} \\rceil = \\lceil 16.67 \\rceil = 17$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{17}$",

Similarly, points $W, X, Y, Z$ divide $\\overline{ML}$ into fifths, with $W$ closest to $M$ and $X$ and $Y$ between $W$ and $Z$.\nStep 3:  We are also told that $[ARM L] = T$, where $T$ is a unit of area. Our goal is to find the area of the trapezoid $PQWZ$.\nStep 4:  To approach this, we can use the fact that the area of a trapezoid is the average of the lengths of its bases multiplied by its height. In this case, the bases of the trapezoid $PQWZ$ are $\\frac{1}{3}AR$ and $\\frac{2}{5}ML$, and the height is the distance between the parallel sides $PQ$ and $WZ$.\nStep 5:  We can use the given information to find the lengths of the bases and the height of the trapezoid, and then apply the formula for the area of a trapezoid to find the final answer.\nStep 6:  Let's start by finding the lengths of the bases and the height of the trapezoid $PQWZ$.\n\nStep 7:  The length of base $PQ$ is $\\frac{1}{3}AR$, and the length of base $WZ$ is $\\frac{2}{5}ML$.\nStep 8:  The height of the trapezoid $PQWZ$ is the distance between the parallel sides $PQ$ and $WZ$, which is equal to the distance between the parallel sides $AR$ and $ML$.\nStep 9:  Since $PQ$ and $WZ$ are parallel, the height of the trapezoid is the same as the height of the parallelogram $ARM L$, which is $T$.\n\nStep 10:  Now that we have the lengths of the bases and the height of the trapezoid, we can use the formula for the area of a trapezoid to find the final answer.\n\nStep 11:  The area of a trapezoid is given by the formula: $\\frac{1}{2} \\times (\\text{sum of the lengths of the bases}) \\times \\text{height}$.\nStep 12:  In this case, the sum of the lengths of the bases is $\\frac{1}{3}AR + \\frac{2}{5}ML$, and the height is $T$.\nStep 13:  Plugging in the values, we get: $\\frac{1}{2} \\times (\\frac{1}{3}AR + \\frac{2}{5}ML) \\times T$.\n\nStep 14:  Now, we can simplify the expression to find the final answer.\n\nStep 15:  We know that $[ARM L] = T$, so we can substitute this value into the expression: $\\frac{1}{2} \\times (\\frac{1}{3}AR + \\frac{2}{5}ML) \\times T = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (\\frac{1}{3}T + \\frac{2}{5}T) \\times T$.\n\nStep 16:  Simplifying further, we get: $\\frac{1}{2} \\times (\\frac{5}{15}T + \\frac{6}{15}T) \\times T = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{11}{15}T \\times T$.\n\nStep 17:  Finally, we can simplify the expression to find the final answer.\n\nStep 18:  Multiplying the fractions, we get: $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{11}{15}T \\times T = \\frac{11}{30}T^2$.\n\nStep 19:  However, we are given that $[ARM L] = T$, so we can substitute this value into the expression: $\\frac{11}{30}T^2 = \\frac{11}{30}T$.\n\nStep 20:  Therefore, the area of the trapezoid $PQWZ$ is $\\frac{11}{30}T$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{11}{30}}",

We are asked to find the number of positive perfect cubes that are divisors of $(T+10)!$.\nStep 2:  The first step is to understand the value of $T$. Since $T = T N Y W R$, we can calculate the value of $T$ by multiplying the individual digits: $T = 2 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 = 1008$.\nStep 3:  Now, we need to find the prime factorization of $1008$. This will help us identify the prime factors that contribute to the perfect cubes that are divisors of $(T+10)!$.\nStep 4:  The prime factorization of $1008$ is $2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7$. This tells us that the prime factors of $1008$ are $2$, $3$, and $7$.\nStep 5:  Next, we need to find the prime factorization of $(T+10)!$. Since $T+10 = 1018$, we need to find the prime factorization of $1018!$.\nStep 6:  The prime factorization of $1018!$ will include all the prime factors of $1008$, as well as any additional prime factors that are present in the numbers from $1$ to $1018$.\nStep 7:  To find the number of positive perfect cubes that are divisors of $(T+10)!$, we need to count the number of perfect cubes that can be formed using the prime factors of $1018!$.\nStep 8:  A perfect cube can be formed by taking a prime factor to the power of $3$. So, we need to count the number of times each prime factor appears in the prime factorization of $1018!$ and then find the number of perfect cubes that can be formed using these prime factors.\nStep 9:  The prime factorization of $1018!$ will include multiple factors of $2$, $3$, and $7$. We need to count the number of times each of these prime factors appears in the prime factorization of $1018!$.\nStep 10:  After counting the number of times each prime factor appears, we can find the number of perfect cubes that can be formed using these prime factors.\nStep 11:  The number of perfect cubes that are divisors of $(T+10)!$ is equal to the number of perfect cubes that can be formed using the prime factors of $1018!$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the number of positive perfect cubes that are divisors of $(T+10)!$ is $\\boxed{6}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$",

The graph intersects the $x$-axis at points $A$ and $M$, which are diagonally opposite vertices of a square $A R M L$.\nStep 2:  We are asked to find the area of the square $A R M L$, denoted as $[A R M L]$.\nStep 3:  The first step is to find the coordinates of points $A$ and $M$. We know that the graph intersects the $x$-axis at these points, so their $y$-coordinates are both $0$. We can use the equation of the graph to find the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $M$.\nStep 4:  The equation of the graph is $y=x^{2}+2 x-T$. Setting $y=0$, we get $x^{2}+2 x-T=0$. This is a quadratic equation in $x$, and we can solve for $x$ using the quadratic formula.\nStep 5:  The quadratic formula states that for an equation of the form $ax^{2}+bx+c=0$, the solutions for $x$ are given by $x=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}$. In this case, $a=1$, $b=2$, and $c=-T$.\nStep 6:  Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get $x=\\frac{-2\\pm\\sqrt{2^{2}-4(1)(-T)}}{2(1)}=\\frac{-2\\pm\\sqrt{4+4T}}{2}=-1\\pm\\sqrt{1+T}$.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $M$ are $-1+\\sqrt{1+T}$ and $-1-\\sqrt{1+T}$, respectively.\nStep 8:  Since $A$ and $M$ are diagonally opposite vertices of a square, the length of the side of the square is the difference between their $x$-coordinates, which is $2\\sqrt{1+T}$.\nStep 9:  The area of a square is given by the formula $[A R M L]=(\\text{side length})^{2}$. Substituting the side length we found, we get $[A R M L]=(2\\sqrt{1+T})^{2}=4(1+T)=4+4T$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the area of the square $A R M L$ is $4+4T$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4+4T}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to start by understanding the given information and what is being asked. We are given a square $A B C D$ with an area of $T=36$. Points $M, N, O$, and $P$ lie on the sides of the square, forming a rectangle $M N O P$.\nStep 2:  The first step is to find the side length of the square $A B C D$. Since the area of the square is $T=36$, the side length can be found by taking the square root of the area, which gives us $s = \\sqrt{T} = \\sqrt{36} = 6$.\nStep 3:  Next, we need to find the length of $M P$, which is given as $2$. Since $M P$ is a diagonal of the rectangle $M N O P$, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of $M N$. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\nStep 4:  In this case, we have a right-angled triangle with $M P$ as the hypotenuse and $M N$ and $P O$ as the other two sides. We know that $M P=2$ and $P O=s/2=3$. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find $M N$ as follows: $M N = \\sqrt{M P^2 - P O^2} = \\sqrt{2^2 - 3^2} = \\sqrt{4 - 9} = \\sqrt{-5}$.\nStep 5:  However, we made an error in our calculation. The correct calculation should be $M N = \\sqrt{M P^2 - P O^2} = \\sqrt{2^2 - 3^2} = \\sqrt{4 - 9} = \\sqrt{-5}$, which is not a real number. This indicates that our previous steps were incorrect, and we need to re-evaluate our approach.\nStep 6:  Let's re-evaluate the problem. We are given that the area of the square is $T=36$, and we need to find the length of $M N$. Since $M P=2$, we can use the fact that the area of a rectangle is equal to the product of its length and width. In this case, the area of the rectangle $M N O P$ is equal to the area of the square $A B C D$, which is $T=36$.\nStep 7:  We can set up an equation using the area of the rectangle: $M N \\cdot P O = T$. Since $P O=s/2=3$, we can substitute this value into the equation to get $M N \\cdot 3 = 36$.\nStep 8:  Solving for $M N$, we get $M N = \\frac{36}{3} = 12$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that Aditya and Ayesha choose the same set of four letters from the alphabet.\nStep 2:  First, let's determine the total number of ways Aditya can choose 2 letters from the first half of the alphabet (A-M) and 2 letters from the second half (N-Z). This can be calculated using combinations, denoted as $\\binom{n}{r}$, which represents the number of ways to choose r items from a set of n items without considering the order.\nStep 3:  For Aditya, the number of ways to choose 2 letters from the first half of the alphabet is $\\binom{13}{2}$, and the number of ways to choose 2 letters from the second half is also $\\binom{13}{2}$. Therefore, the total number of ways for Aditya to choose 2 letters from each half is $\\binom{13}{2} \\times \\binom{13}{2}$.\nStep 4:  Similarly, for Ayesha, the number of ways to choose 2 letters from the first half of the alphabet is also $\\binom{13}{2}$, and the number of ways to choose 2 letters from the second half is also $\\binom{13}{2}$. Therefore, the total number of ways for Ayesha to choose 2 letters from each half is $\\binom{13}{2} \\times \\binom{13}{2}$.\nStep 5:  Now, we need to find the number of ways Aditya and Ayesha can choose the same set of four letters. This can be calculated by finding the number of ways to choose 4 letters from the entire alphabet, which is $\\binom{26}{4}$.\nStep 6:  The probability that Aditya and Ayesha choose the same set of four letters is then given by the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes (choosing the same set of four letters) to the total number of possible outcomes (choosing any set of four letters).\nStep 7:  Therefore, the probability is $\\frac{\\binom{26}{4}}{\\left( \\binom{13}{2} \\right)^2}$.\nStep 8:  Calculating this, we get $\\frac{12650}{4225} = \\frac{2530}{845}$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the probability that Aditya and Ayesha choose the same set of four letters is $\\frac{2530}{845}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{2530}{845}}$",

This means that the element should not share any prime factors with the other numbers in the sequence.\nStep 3:  We are given that $n=6$, so we have a sequence of 6 consecutive positive integers.\nStep 4:  To maximize the number of cromulent elements, we need to find a sequence where the elements are as far apart as possible, so that they don't share any prime factors.\nStep 5:  The sequence with the maximum number of cromulent elements will be one where the elements are not multiples of 2, 3, or 5, as these are the prime factors that would make an element not cromulent.\nStep 6:  The first few positive integers that are not multiples of 2, 3, or 5 are 1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, and so on.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the maximum possible number of cromulent elements in a sequence of 6 consecutive positive integers is 6, as we can choose the first 6 numbers from this sequence.\nStep 8:  On the other hand, to minimize the number of cromulent elements, we need to find a sequence where the elements are as close together as possible, so that they share as many prime factors as possible.\nStep 9:  The sequence with the minimum number of cromulent elements will be one where the elements are multiples of 2, 3, or 5, as these are the prime factors that would make an element not cromulent.\nStep 10:  The first few positive integers that are multiples of 2, 3, or 5 are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, and so on.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the minimum possible number of cromulent elements in a sequence of 6 consecutive positive integers is 1, as we can choose the first number from this sequence.\nStep 12:  Hence, the maximum and minimum possible number of cromulent elements in a sequence of $n$ consecutive positive integers with $n=6$ are 6 and 1, respectively.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$",
  "To find the maximum and minimum possible number of cromulent elements in a sequence of $n$ consecutive positive integers with $n=7$, we need to consider the properties of consecutive integers and the concept of being relatively prime.\n\nFirst, let's understand what it means for two numbers to be relatively prime. Two numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1. In other words, they have no common factors other than 1.\n\nNow, let's consider a sequence of $n$ consecutive positive integers. We can represent this sequence as $x, x+1, x+2, \\ldots, x+n-1$, where $x$ is the first integer in the sequence.\n\nFor an element $a$ in the sequence to be cromulent, it must be relatively prime to all other elements in the sequence. This means that $a$ cannot share any common factors with any other element in the sequence.\n\nLet's consider the possible values of $a$ in the sequence. Since the sequence consists of consecutive integers, the possible values of $a$ are $x, x+1, x+2, \\ldots, x+n-1$.\n\nTo maximize the number of cromulent elements, we want to choose $x$ such that it has the fewest possible common factors with the other elements in the sequence. This means that $x$ should be a prime number, as prime numbers have no common factors with any other number except for 1.\n\nIf $x$ is a prime number, then all the elements in the sequence will be relatively prime to each other, except for the element $x$ itself. This is because $x$ will have a common factor with itself, which is $x$ itself.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible number of cromulent elements in the sequence is $n-1$, which is $7-1=6$.\n\nTo minimize the number of cromulent elements, we want to choose $x$ such that it has the most possible common factors with the other elements in the sequence. This means that $x$ should be a number that is divisible by as many other numbers as possible.\n\nIf $x$ is a multiple of a number $d$, then all the elements in the sequence will be divisible by $d$, except for the element $x-d$. This is because $x-d$ will be the first element in the sequence, and it will not be divisible by $d$.\n\nTherefore, the minimum possible number of cromulent elements in the sequence is 1, which occurs when $x$ is a multiple of a number $d$ that is common to all the elements in the sequence.\n\nFor example, if $x=14$, then the sequence is $14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20$. In this case, the only cromulent element is $19$, because it is relatively prime to all the other elements in the sequence.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible number of cromulent elements in the sequence is $\\boxed{6}$, and the minimum possible number of cromulent elements is $\\boxed{1}$.",

Since $c$ is an integer, $240-2x$ must be a multiple of $5$.\nStep 10:  The largest multiple of $5$ less than $240$ is $235$, so we can set $240-2x=235$ to find the maximum value of $c$.\nStep 11:  Solving for $x$, we get $x = \\frac{5}{2}$. However, $x$ must be an integer, so this value of $x$ is not valid.\nStep 12:  The next largest multiple of $5$ less than $240$ is $230$, so we can set $240-2x=230$ to find the next largest value of $c$.\nStep 13:  Solving for $x$, we get $x = 5$.

  "Step 1:  To find the least integer value of the function $f(x)=\\frac{x^{4}-6 x^{3}+2 x^{2}-6 x+2}{x^{2}+1}$, we first need to understand the nature of the function and its behavior.\nStep 2:  The function $f(x)$ is a rational function, which means it is the ratio of two polynomials. The numerator is a quartic polynomial, and the denominator is a quadratic polynomial.\nStep 3:  To determine the least integer value of the function, we need to find the minimum value of the function over the set of all real numbers.\nStep 4:  We can start by analyzing the numerator of the function, which is $x^{4}-6 x^{3}+2 x^{2}-6 x+2$. We can try to factorize this polynomial to understand its behavior better.\nStep 5:  By factoring the numerator, we get $x^{4}-6 x^{3}+2 x^{2}-6 x+2 = (x-1)^{2}(x^{2}-5 x+2)$.\nStep 6:  Now, we can analyze the quadratic factor $x^{2}-5 x+2$ to determine its roots.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to consider the properties of the mean, median, and mode of a list of positive integers.\nStep 2:  We are given that the mean, median, and unique mode of the list are three consecutive integers in some order. This means that the mean is the average of the three numbers, the median is the middle number when the numbers are arranged in ascending order, and the mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list.\nStep 3:  Let's denote the three consecutive integers as $n-1,$ $n,$ and $n+1.$ Since the mean is the average of these three numbers, we have the equation $\\frac{(n-1)+(n)+(n+1)}{3}=n.$\nStep 4:  Simplifying this equation, we get $3n=3n,$ which is always true. This means that the mean, median, and mode can be any three consecutive integers.\nStep 5:  However, we are asked to find the least possible sum of the integers in the original list. To minimize the sum, we need to minimize the value of $n.$\nStep 6:  Since the mode is unique, the smallest possible value for $n$ is 1. Therefore, the three consecutive integers are 0, 1, and 2.\nStep 7:  However, the problem states that the integers are positive, so we cannot have 0 as one of the integers. Therefore, the smallest possible value for $n$ is 2.\nStep 8:  The three consecutive integers are then 1, 2, and 3. To find the least possible sum of the integers in the original list, we need to find the smallest possible value of $n$ that satisfies the given conditions.\nStep 9:  Since the mode is unique, the smallest possible value for $n$ is 2. Therefore, the three consecutive integers are 1, 2, and 3.\nStep 10:  The sum of these integers is $1+2+3=6.$ Therefore, the least possible sum of the integers in the original list is $\\boxed{6}.$\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$",

The product of two complex numbers $(a+bi)$ and $(c+di)$ is given by $(ac-bd)+(ad+bc)i$.\nStep 4:  Applying this to the given complex numbers, we get $(57-8 \\sqrt{5} i)(-6+5 \\sqrt{5} i) = (57 \\cdot (-6) - (-8 \\sqrt{5}) \\cdot (5 \\sqrt{5})) + (57 \\cdot 5 + (-8 \\sqrt{5}) \\cdot (-6))i$.\nStep 5:  Simplifying this expression, we get $-342 + 200 + (-285 + 48)i = -142 + 333 \\sqrt{5} i$.\nStep 6:  Therefore, we have found that $z = (57-8 \\sqrt{5} i)(-6+5 \\sqrt{5} i)$.\nStep 7:  Now, we need to find the values of $a, b, c$, and $d$ for the expression $(a+b \\sqrt{5} i)(c+d \\sqrt{5} i)$.\nStep 8:  We can see that the real part of the product is $-142$, and the imaginary part is $333 \\sqrt{5}$.\nStep 9:  This means that $ac - bd = -142$ and $ad + bc = 333 \\sqrt{5}$.\nStep 10:  We can solve these equations to find the values of $a, b, c$, and $d$.\nStep 11:  After solving, we find that $a=24, b=1, c=-3$, and $d=14$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the lesser of $a+b$ and $c+d$ is $\\min \\{24+1, -3+14\\} = \\min \\{25, 11\\} = \\boxed{11}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{11}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the largest possible perimeter of the region enclosed by three non-overlapping squares with positive integer side lengths.\nStep 2:  We are given that the three squares have one vertex at the origin and sides parallel to the coordinate axes, and together they enclose a region whose area is 41.\nStep 3:  Let's denote the side lengths of the squares as $a$, $b$, and $c$. The area of the enclosed region is given by the sum of the areas of the three squares, which is $ab + bc + ca = 41$.\nStep 4:  We are asked to find the largest possible perimeter of the region, which is given by $2(a + b + c)$.\nStep 5:  To maximize the perimeter, we need to maximize the sum of the side lengths $a + b + c$.\nStep 6:  We can use the AM-GM inequality to find the maximum value of $a + b + c$.\nStep 7:  The AM-GM inequality states that for non-negative real numbers $x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n$, the following inequality holds: $\\frac{x_1 + x_2 + \\cdots + x_n}{n} \\geq \\sqrt[n]{x_1x_2 \\cdots x_n}$.\nStep 8:  Applying the AM-GM inequality to the side lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$, we get: $a + b + c \\geq 3 \\sqrt[3]{abc}$.\nStep 9:  We also know that $ab + bc + ca = 41$, which can be rewritten as $abc \\leq 41$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, we have $a + b + c \\geq 3 \\sqrt[3]{abc} \\geq 3 \\sqrt[3]{41}$.\nStep 11:  To find the maximum value of $a + b + c$, we need to find the largest possible value of $3 \\sqrt[3]{41}$.\nStep 12:  Since $3 \\sqrt[3]{41}$ is an irrational number, we can't find an exact value for it. However, we can find the largest integer value that is greater than or equal to $3 \\sqrt[3]{41}$.\nStep 13:  By calculating $3 \\sqrt[3]{41}$, we find that it is approximately $15.1$.\nStep 14:  Therefore, the largest possible value of $a + b + c$ is $15$.\nStep 15:  To find the side lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$ that maximize the perimeter, we need to find the values that satisfy $ab + bc + ca = 41$ and $a + b + c = 15$.\nStep 16:  By trial and error, we find that the side lengths $a = 1$, $b = 7$, and $c = 6$ satisfy both conditions.\nStep 17:  Therefore, the largest possible perimeter of the region is $2(a + b + c) = 2(1 + 7 + 6) = \\boxed{28}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{28}$",

Then, we have the equation $x - y = 7$.\nStep 6:  Since $AB = BC$, we can also express $BC$ as $x$. Therefore, $AC = AB + BC = x + x = 2x$.\nStep 7:  Now, we need to find the value of $AC$. To do this, we can use the fact that $BD = \\frac{1}{3} AC$.

This means that we need to find the smallest value of $n$ such that the angles in the set cover all four quadrants.\nStep 4:  To do this, we can start by finding the first angle in the set that falls in each quadrant. We can then use this information to determine the smallest value of $n$ that satisfies the condition.\nStep 5:  The first angle in the set is $123^{\\circ}$, which falls in the second quadrant. The next angle in the set is $246^{\\circ}$, which falls in the third quadrant. The next angle after that is $369^{\\circ}$, which falls in the fourth quadrant.\nStep 6:  We can see that the angles in the set are increasing by $123^{\\circ}$ each time, so we can find the next angle in the set by adding $123^{\\circ}$ to the previous angle.\nStep 7:  We can continue this process until we find the smallest value of $n$ such that the set contains at least one angle in each of the four quadrants.\nStep 8:  By analyzing the angles in the set and their corresponding values of $n$, we can determine the smallest value of $n$ that satisfies the condition.\nStep 9:  After analyzing the angles in the set and their corresponding values of $n$, we find that the smallest value of $n$ such that the set contains at least one angle in each of the four quadrants is $n = \\boxed{5}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand what an arithmetic sequence is. An arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers in which the difference between any two consecutive terms is constant. This constant difference is called the common difference.\nStep 2:  We are given that the first term of the sequence, $a_1$, is 10, and the term at position $a_2$ is 100. We need to find the value of the term at position $a_{a_3}$.\nStep 3:  The common difference between consecutive terms in the sequence is denoted by $d$. We can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence, which is $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$, to find the value of $d$.\nStep 4:  We know that $a_2 = a_1 + d$, and we are given that $a_2 = 100$. So, we can write the equation $100 = 10 + d$, which simplifies to $d = 90$.\nStep 5:  Now that we have the value of $d$, we can find the value of $a_3$ using the formula $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$. Substituting $n=3$, we get $a_3 = 10 + 2(90) = 190$.\nStep 6:  Next, we need to find the value of $a_{a_3}$. This means we need to find the term at position $a_3$ in the sequence. We can use the formula $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$ again, but this time we substitute $n = a_3 = 190$.\nStep 7:  So, $a_{a_3} = 10 + (190-1)90 = 10 + 17190 = 17100$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the value of $a_{a_{a_3}}$ is $17100$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{17100}$",

Therefore, the smallest multiple of $10^T$ that is divisible by 3 is $10^T + 1$.\nStep 8:  Next, we need to find the smallest multiple of $10^T + 1$ that is divisible by 11. We can do this by finding the remainder when $10^T + 1$ is divided by 11.\nStep 9:  Since $10^T + 1$ is a power of 10 plus 1, it will always leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 11. Therefore, the smallest multiple of $10^T + 1$ that is divisible by 11 is $10^T + 1 + 11$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the smallest $T$-digit number that is divisible by 33 is $10^T + 1 + 11 = 10^T + 12$.\nStep 11:  Now, we need to find the product of the last two digits of $N$, which is $10^T + 12$.\nStep 12:  The last two digits of $10^T + 12$ are 12, and the product of 12 and 12 is 144.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{144}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given information and what is being asked. We are given a value of $T$ as $\\frac{9}{17}$ and are asked to find the area of a square pyramid with specific properties.\nStep 2:  The first step is to express $T$ as a reduced fraction, which means finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and denominator and dividing both by the GCD. In this case, the GCD of 9 and 17 is 1, so the reduced fraction of $T$ is still $\\frac{9}{17}$.\nStep 3:  We are then asked to find the values of $m$ and $n$, which represent the numerator and denominator of the reduced fraction of $T$, respectively. In this case, $m=9$ and $n=17$.\nStep 4:  Next, we are given that the distance from vertex $P$ to the base of the pyramid is $n-m$, and the distance from vertex $P$ to each of the base points $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ is $n$. This gives us the equation $n-m=n$, which simplifies to $m=0$. However, this is a contradiction since $m$ is the numerator of the reduced fraction of $T$, and it cannot be 0. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate our approach.\nStep 5:  We are given that $P A=P B=P C=P D=n$, and the distance from vertex $P$ to the base is $n-m$. This implies that the height of the pyramid is $n-m$, and the base is a square with side length $n$. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height of the pyramid.\nStep 6:  The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, we have a right-angled triangle with the height of the pyramid as one side, and half the diagonal of the base as the other side.\nStep 7:  The diagonal of the base is $\\sqrt{2}n$, so half the diagonal is $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}n}{2}$. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the height of the pyramid: $n^2=\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}n}{2}\\right)^2+(n-m)^2$.\nStep 8:  Solving for $n-m$, we get $n-m=\\frac{n}{2}$. Since $m=9$ and $n=17$, we can substitute these values into the equation to find the height of the pyramid.\nStep 9:  The height of the pyramid is $n-m=\\frac{n}{2}=\\frac{17}{2}$.\nStep 10:  Now that we have the height of the pyramid, we can find the area of the base, which is a square with side length $n$. The area of a square is given by the formula $A = s^2$, where $s$ is the length of a side.\nStep 11:  Substituting $n=17$ into the formula, we get the area of the base as $A = 17^2 = 289$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the area of the square $A B C D$ is $\\boxed{289}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{289}$",

This probability is $\\frac{8}{d-1}$.\nStep 6:  Next, we need to calculate the probability that the second person is a Leo, given that his birthday is after the $d^{\\text {th }}$ day of July. This probability is $\\frac{8}{31-d}$.\nStep 7:  We also need to calculate the probability that neither of the two people is a Leo, given that one person's birthday is before the $d^{\\text {th }}$ day of July and the other person's birthday is after the $d^{\\text {th }}$ day of July. This probability is $\\frac{23}{d-1} \\cdot \\frac{18}{31-d}$.\nStep 8:  Finally, we need to calculate the probability that exactly one of the two people is a Leo, which is the sum of the probabilities that the first person is a Leo and the second person is not, and the probability that the first person is not a Leo and the second person is a Leo.\nStep 9:  We can then simplify the expression to obtain the final probability.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{23}{30}}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given information and what is being asked. We are given a sequence $T = T N Y W R$ and an expression $k = 21 + 2T$. We are then asked to find the largest integer $n$ such that the expression $2n^2 - kn + 77$ is a positive prime number.\nStep 2:  The first step is to determine the value of $T$ and then calculate the value of $k$. We are given that $T = T N Y W R$, which implies that $T = 5$. Substituting this value into the expression for $k$, we get $k = 21 + 2 \\cdot 5 = 31$.\nStep 3:  Now that we have the value of $k$, we can express the given quadratic expression as $2n^2 - 31n + 77$. Our goal is to find the largest integer $n$ for which this expression is a positive prime number.\nStep 4:  To do this, we can use the properties of quadratic expressions and prime numbers. We can start by factoring the quadratic expression and then analyze the factors to determine the possible values of $n$.\nStep 5:  Factoring the quadratic expression $2n^2 - 31n + 77$, we get $(2n-7)(n-11)$. This tells us that the expression can be written as a product of two factors.\nStep 6:  We know that for the expression to be a positive prime number, one of the factors must be equal to $1$ or $-1$. This gives us the conditions $2n-7 = \\pm 1$ and $n-11 = \\pm 1$.\nStep 7:  Solving these equations, we find that $n = 4$ or $n = 9$.\nStep 8:  We need to check which of these values of $n$ results in a positive prime number when substituted back into the original expression.\nStep 9:  Substituting $n = 4$ into the expression, we get $2(4)^2 - 31(4) + 77 = 32 - 124 + 77 = -15$, which is not a positive prime number.\nStep 10:  Substituting $n = 9$ into the expression, we get $2(9)^2 - 31(9) + 77 = 162 - 279 + 77 = -40$, which is also not a positive prime number.\nStep 11:  However, we are asked to find the largest integer $n$ for which the expression is a positive prime number.

This will help us determine the conditions for divisibility.\nStep 2:  The prime factorization of 264 is $2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 11$.

To minimize $N$, we need to place the largest possible digits in the leftmost positions.\nStep 4:  Since we have two 3's, we can place one of them in the thousands place to minimize the value of $N$.

Since the ellipse is tangent to the $y$-axis, the center of the ellipse must be at $(4,7)$, which is the midpoint of the line segment connecting the two foci.\nStep 4:  The distance between the two foci is given as $2c$, where $c$ is the distance from the center to either focus. In this case, the distance between the two foci is $d - 3$.\nStep 5:  We also know that the distance between the two foci is equal to $2c$, so we can set up the equation $d - 3 = 2c$.\nStep 6:  Additionally, we are given that the ellipse is tangent to the $x$-axis, which means that the length of the semi-major axis is equal to the distance from the center to the point of tangency on the $x$-axis.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given information and what is being asked. We are dealing with a square with an area of 650, and we know the coordinates of point $A$ as $(11,5)$. Points $R, M$, and $L$ are the midpoints of the sides of this square, and we are asked to find the number of possible ordered pairs $(x, y)$ of coordinates for point $R$, which is in Quadrant I and is a lattice point.\nStep 2:  The first step is to find the side length of the square. Since the area of the square is 650, we can find the side length by taking the square root of the area, which gives us $\\sqrt{650} = 25.5$. However, since the side length must be an integer, we can consider the side length to be 26, as it is the smallest integer greater than 25.5.\nStep 3:  Next, we need to find the coordinates of points $M$ and $L$. Since $A$ is at $(11,5)$, the midpoint of the side opposite to $A$ will be at $(11,5)$. The midpoint of the side adjacent to $A$ will be at $(11,5) + (13,0) = (24,5)$, and the midpoint of the side opposite to $A$ will be at $(11,5) + (0,13) = (11,18)$.\nStep 4:  Now, we need to find the coordinates of point $R$. Since $R$ is in Quadrant I and is a lattice point, its coordinates must be of the form $(x,y)$, where $x$ and $y$ are positive integers. We also know that the coordinates of $R$ must satisfy the equation $x^2 + y^2 = 26^2 = 676$.\nStep 5:  To find the possible ordered pairs $(x, y)$ of coordinates for point $R$, we need to find all the pairs of positive integers $(x,y)$ that satisfy the equation $x^2 + y^2 = 676$.\nStep 6:  We can start by listing the possible values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the equation. We can then check which pairs of $(x,y)$ satisfy the condition that $R$ is a lattice point and is in Quadrant I.\nStep 7:  After finding all the possible pairs of $(x,y)$, we can count the number of pairs to determine the total number of possible ordered pairs of coordinates for point $R$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$",

Since $A M$ is perpendicular to $R L$, we can form a right-angled triangle with $A M$ as the height and $R L$ as the base.\nStep 4:  We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of $A L$. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\nStep 5:  In this case, we have $A L$ as the hypotenuse, and $R M$ and $A M$ as the other two sides. We can use the given lengths of $A R$, $R M$, and $A M$ to find the length of $A L$.\nStep 6:  We can start by finding the length of $M L$ using the given length of $R L$ and the fact that $A R=R M=5$.

Since $\\angle B A F = 30^{\\circ}$, we have $A G = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $C G = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nStep 6:  Now, we can use the fact that the incenter of a triangle is the intersection of the angle bisectors to find the coordinates of the incenters of triangles $A G E$ and $C G F$.\nStep 7:  The incenter of triangle $A G E$ is the intersection of the angle bisectors of $\\angle A G E$ and $\\angle A E G$, which is $\\left(\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right)$. Similarly, the incenter of triangle $C G F$ is the intersection of the angle bisectors of $\\angle C G F$ and $\\angle C F G$, which is $\\left(\\frac{3}{4}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right)$.\nStep 8:  Finally, we can use the distance formula to find the distance between the two incenters.\nStep 9:  The distance between the two points is given by $\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{3}{4} - \\frac{1}{4}\\right)^{2} + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right)^{2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2} + 0^{2}} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first understand the given conditions and what is being asked. We are given positive integers $a, b, m, n$ such that $a m=b n=120$ and $a \\neq b$. We are also given points $A=(a, m), B=(b, n)$, and $O=(0,0)$ in the coordinate plane. Our goal is to find the minimum area of the parallelogram $A O B X$.\nStep 2:  We start by considering the properties of a parallelogram. In a parallelogram, the midpoints of the diagonals coincide. Therefore, the midpoint of diagonal $\\overline{AO}$ is the same as the midpoint of diagonal $\\overline{BX}$.\nStep 3:  Let's denote the midpoint of $\\overline{AO}$ as $M$. Then, the coordinates of $M$ are $\\left(\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{m}{2}\\right)$. Since $M$ is also the midpoint of $\\overline{BX}$, we have the coordinates of $X$ as $\\left(2b-a, \\frac{m+n}{2}\\right)$.\nStep 4:  The area of a parallelogram can be calculated using the formula $A = bh$, where $b$ is the base and $h$ is the height. In this case, the base of the parallelogram is the distance between points $A$ and $O$, which is $a$, and the height is the distance between points $B$ and $X$, which is $m+n$.\nStep 5:  Therefore, the area of the parallelogram $A O B X$ is given by $A = a(m+n)$.\nStep 6:  We are given that $a m=b n=120$, which implies that $a$ and $b$ are factors of $120$. Since $a \\neq b$, we need to find the minimum value of $a(m+n)$.\nStep 7:  To minimize $a(m+n)$, we need to minimize the value of $a$ and maximize the value of $m+n$. Since $a$ and $b$ are factors of $120$, the minimum value of $a$ is $2$ and the maximum value of $m+n$ is $120$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the minimum area of the parallelogram $A O B X$ is $2(120) = \\boxed{240}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{240}$",

Therefore, the discriminant is $(-2)^2-4(-1)(n)=4+4n$.\nStep 4:  For the quadratic expression to have a non-negative discriminant, we must have $4+4n \\ge 0$, which simplifies to $n \\ge -1$.\nStep 5:  Additionally, the roots of the quadratic expression must be non-positive.

We are tasked with finding all ordered pairs $(x, y)$ that satisfy both equations simultaneously.\n## Step 2:  To approach this problem, we can start by manipulating the given equations to simplify them and make it easier to solve for the ordered pairs.\n## Step 3:  The first equation is $x^{2}+y^{2}=6 y-4 x+12$, and the second equation is $4 y=x^{2}+4 x+12$.\n## Step 4:  We can rewrite the second equation as $x^{2}+4 x+12-4 y=0$.\n## Step 5:  By substituting $x^{2}+4 x+12-4 y$ for $x^{2}$ in the first equation, we get $(x^{2}+4 x+12-4 y)+y^{2}=6 y-4 x+12$.\n## Step 6:  Simplifying this expression, we obtain $x^{2}+4 x+12-4 y+y^{2}=6 y-4 x+12$, which further simplifies to $x^{2}+y^{2}-4 y=0$.\n## Step 7:  Rearranging the terms, we get $x^{2}+(y-2)^{2}=4$.\n## Step 8:  This equation represents a circle with center $(0, 2)$ and radius $2$.\n## Step 9:  We can then find the points of intersection between this circle and the line $y=x+3$.\n## Step 10:  To do this, we can substitute $y=x+3$ into the equation of the circle, $x^{2}+(y-2)^{2}=4$, to obtain $x^{2}+((x+3)-2)^{2}=4$.\n## Step 11:  Simplifying this expression, we get $x^{2}+(x+1)^{2}=4$, which further simplifies to $2x^{2}+4x=0$.\n## Step 12:  Factoring out $2x$, we have $2x(x+2)=0$.\n## Step 13:  This gives us two possible solutions: $x=0$ and $x=-2$.\n## Step 14:  Substituting these values of $x$ back into the equation $y=x+3$, we find the corresponding values of $y$ to be $y=3$ and $y=1$.\n## Step 15:  Therefore, the ordered pairs that satisfy both equations are $(0, 3)$ and $(-2, 1)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\left( 0, \\  3\\right),\\left( -2, \\  1\\right)}",

These primes are 23, 37, 53, 73, and 79.\nStep 4:  We need to find the smallest integer that contains these prime pairs in such a way that it is worth exactly 11 points.\nStep 5:  To achieve this, we can start by considering the smallest prime pair, which is 23.

To achieve this, we can try to add the prime pair 79 to the existing integer 1237737.\nStep 13:  Adding the prime pair 79 to 1237737 results in the integer 12377397, which contains the prime pairs 23, 37, 73, 73, 79, and 79, making it worth 6 points.\nStep 14:  We can continue this process by adding the prime pair 79 to 12377397, resulting in the integer 123773997, which contains the prime pairs 23, 37, 73, 73, 79, 79, and 79, making it worth 7 points.\nStep 15:  Adding the prime pair 79 to 123773997 results in the integer 1237739997, which contains the prime pairs 23, 37, 73, 73, 79, 79, 79, and 79, making it worth 8 points.\nStep 16:  Continuing this process, we find that adding the prime pair 79 to 1237739997 results in the integer 12377399997, which contains the prime pairs 23, 37, 73, 73, 79, 79, 79, 79, and 79, making it worth 9 points.\nStep 17:  Finally, adding the prime pair 79 to 12377399997 results in the integer 123773999997, which contains the prime pairs 23, 37, 73, 73, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, and 79, making it worth 10 points.\nStep 18:  To reach a total of 11 points, we need to add one more prime pair to 123773999997. The smallest prime pair that can be added is 79, but this would result in a leading zero, which is not allowed.\nStep 19:  Therefore, we need to add the prime pair 73 to 123773999997, resulting in the integer 1237739999973, which contains the prime pairs 23, 37, 73, 73, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, 79, and 73, making it worth 11 points.\nStep 20:  Therefore, the smallest positive integer that is worth exactly 11 points is $\\boxed{1237739999973}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1237739999973}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to consider the different ways in which the letters can be arranged to form a four-letter word where $E E$ is a subsequence.\nStep 2:  We can approach this by considering the positions of the two $E$s in the four-letter word and then counting the possibilities for the remaining two letters.\nStep 3:  First, let's consider the case where the two $E$s are adjacent. In this case, we have $4$ choices for the first letter, $3$ choices for the second letter, and $2$ choices for the third letter. This gives us a total of $4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 = 24$ possibilities.\nStep 4:  Next, let's consider the case where the two $E$s are not adjacent. In this case, we have $4$ choices for the first letter, $3$ choices for the second letter, $2$ choices for the third letter, and $1$ choice for the fourth letter. This gives us a total of $4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = 24$ possibilities.\nStep 5:  However, we need to account for the fact that the two $E$s can be in any of the four positions in the word. This means that for each of the $24$ possibilities where the two $E$s are adjacent, we have $4$ different arrangements of the word. Similarly, for each of the $24$ possibilities where the two $E$s are not adjacent, we also have $4$ different arrangements of the word.\nStep 6:  Therefore, the total number of distinct four-letter words for which $E E$ is a subsequence is $24 \\cdot 4 + 24 \\cdot 4 = 192$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{192}$",

The angle bisector from vertex $C$ meets side $\\overline{AB}$ at point $D$ such that $AD = 229$. Additionally, we know that $AC$ and $AD$ are relatively prime.\nStep 3:  We can start by using the Angle Bisector Theorem, which states that the ratio of the lengths of the two segments of the side split by the angle bisector is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the other two sides of the triangle. Applying this theorem to triangle $ABC$, we get the equation $\\frac{AD}{DB} = \\frac{AC}{BC}$.\nStep 4:  We are also given that $AC + BC + AB = 2019$, and we know that $AD = 229$. Using the fact that $AC$ and $AD$ are relatively prime, we can deduce that $AC$ must be a divisor of $2019 - 229 = 1790$.\nStep 5:  By considering the factors of $1790$, we can determine the possible values of $AC$. We find that $AC$ can be $10, 179, 910,$ or $1790$. However, we need to eliminate the cases where $AC$ is not relatively prime to $229$.\nStep 6:  After eliminating the cases where $AC$ is not relatively prime to $229$, we are left with the possibility that $AC = 910$.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of selfies required so that each pair of the eight students appears in exactly one selfie.\nStep 2:  We can start by considering the total number of pairs of students. Since there are 8 students, the total number of pairs can be calculated using the combination formula $\\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$, where $n$ is the number of students. Substituting $n=8$, we get $\\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8(8-1)}{2} = 28$ pairs of students.\nStep 3:  Now, we need to find the minimum number of selfies required to ensure that each pair of students appears in exactly one selfie. This can be achieved by creating a complete graph with 8 vertices, where each vertex represents a student. Each edge in the graph represents a pair of students.\nStep 4:  The minimum number of selfies required is equivalent to the minimum number of edges in a complete graph with 8 vertices. This can be calculated using the formula for the number of edges in a complete graph, which is $\\binom{n}{2}$, where $n$ is the number of vertices. Substituting $n=8$, we get $\\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8(8-1)}{2} = 28$ edges.\nStep 5:  However, we need to consider the fact that each selfie can have either 2 or 3 students in the picture.

For a number $N$ with $n$ digits, the smallest number that gains an extra digit when doubled is $10^{n-1}+1$.\nStep 4:  This is because when we double $10^{n-1}+1$, we get $2 \\cdot 10^{n-1} + 2$, which has $n$ digits. Therefore, the smallest number that gains an extra digit when doubled is $10^{n-1}+1$.\nStep 5:  We can then find the range of numbers that gain an extra digit when doubled by considering the numbers from $10^{n-1}+1$ to $10^n-1$.\nStep 6:  The number of integers in this range is $10^n - (10^{n-1}+1) = 9 \\cdot 10^{n-1}$.\nStep 7:  We are looking for the $2011^{\\text {th }}$ smallest positive integer $N$ that gains an extra digit when doubled, so we need to find the value of $n$ such that $9 \\cdot 10^{n-1} \\ge 2011$.\nStep 8:  Solving for $n$, we get $n \\ge 4$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the $2011^{\\text {th }}$ smallest positive integer $N$ that gains an extra digit when doubled is in the range of numbers with $4$ digits.\nStep 10:  We can then find the value of $N$ by considering the numbers in this range and finding the $2011^{\\text {th }}$ smallest one.\nStep 11:  The first number in this range is $10^3+1=1001$, and the last number is $10^4-1=9999$.\nStep 12:  We can then find the $2011^{\\text {th }}$ smallest number by counting the numbers in this range and finding the $2011^{\\text {th }}$ smallest one.\nStep 13:  The $2011^{\\text {th }}$ smallest number is $10^3+1+2010=10101$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10101}$",

This means that the circle centered at $M$ is tangent to both $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{BC}$ at $C$.\nStep 3:  We're also given that $AC=5$ and $BC=12$. We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of side $AB$. The theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\nStep 4:  Therefore, we have $AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2 = 5^2 + 12^2 = 25 + 144 = 169$. Taking the square root of both sides gives us $AB = 13$.\nStep 5:  Now, let's consider the circle centered at $M$ with radius $r$.

This means that the triangle formed by the radii and the sides of the triangle is a right-angled triangle.\nStep 7:  We can use the fact that the radius of the circle is perpendicular to the tangent line at the point of tangency to find the length of the radius $r$.\nStep 8:  By applying the Pythagorean Theorem to the right-angled triangle formed by the radii and the sides of the triangle, we can find the value of $r$.\nStep 9:  The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\nStep 10:  Therefore, we have $r^2 = (AM)^2 - (CM)^2 = (AM)^2 - (AC - CM)^2 = (AM)^2 - (5 - CM)^2$.\nStep 11:  We also know that $AM = 13 - r$ and $CM = r$. Substituting these values into the equation, we get $r^2 = (13 - r)^2 - (5 - r)^2$.\nStep 12:  Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get $r^2 = 169 - 26r + r^2 - (25 - 10r + r^2)$.\nStep 13:  Combining like terms, we get $r^2 = 169 - 26r + r^2 - 25 + 10r - r^2$.\nStep 14:  Simplifying further, we get $r^2 = 144 - 16r$.\nStep 15:  Rearranging the equation, we get $r^2 + 16r - 144 = 0$.\nStep 16:  We can solve this quadratic equation to find the value of $r$.\nStep 17:  Factoring the quadratic equation, we get $(r + 18)(r - 8) = 0$.\nStep 18:  This gives us two possible values for $r$: $r = -18$ or $r = 8$.\nStep 19:  However, since the radius of a circle cannot be negative, we discard the solution $r = -18$.\nStep 20:  Therefore, the value of the radius $r$ is $r = \\boxed{8}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$",

  "Step 1:  We are given that the quadratic polynomial $f(x)$ has a zero at $x=2$, which means $f(2) = 0$. Additionally, we know that the polynomial $f(f(x))$ has only one real zero at $x=5$, which implies that $f(f(5)) = 0$.\nStep 2:  To find the value of $f(0)$, we need to understand the behavior of the polynomial $f(x)$ and its composition with itself, $f(f(x))$.\nStep 3:  Since $f(2) = 0$, we can express $f(x)$ as $f(x) = a(x-2)(x-3)$ for some constant $a$. This form ensures that $f(2) = 0$ and $f(3) = 0$.\nStep 4:  Now, we need to find the value of $a$ such that $f(f(5)) = 0$. Substituting $f(5)$ into the expression for $f(x)$, we get $f(f(5)) = a(f(5)-2)(f(5)-3)$. We know that $f(5) = a(5-2)(5-3) = 6a$, so we have $f(f(5)) = a(6a-2)(6a-3)$.\nStep 5:  Since $f(f(5)) = 0$, we can equate the expression to $0$ and solve for $a$. This gives us the equation $a(6a-2)(6a-3) = 0$. We find that $a = 0$ or $6a-2 = 0$ or $6a-3 = 0$. However, $a = 0$ is not a valid solution as it would make $f(x)$ a constant polynomial, and we know that $f(x)$ has a zero at $x=2$. Therefore, we have $6a-2 = 0$ or $6a-3 = 0$, which gives us $a = \\frac{1}{3}$ or $a = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nStep 6:  We can now substitute these values of $a$ back into the expression for $f(x)$ to find the corresponding polynomials. For $a = \\frac{1}{3}$, we have $f(x) = \\frac{1}{3}(x-2)(x-3)$, and for $a = \\frac{1}{2}$, we have $f(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(x-2)(x-3)$.\nStep 7:  We can then evaluate $f(0)$ for each of these polynomials to find the final answer.\nStep 8:  For $f(x) = \\frac{1}{3}(x-2)(x-3)$, we have $f(0) = \\frac{1}{3}(-2)(-3) = 2$.\nStep 9:  For $f(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(x-2)(x-3)$, we have $f(0) = \\frac{1}{2}(-2)(-3) = 3$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the value of $f(0)$ is $\\boxed{3}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$",

Plugging these values into the formula, we get: $d = \\frac{999 - 0}{15-1} = \\frac{999}{14} = 71\\frac{5}{14}$.\nStep 6:  However, since the difference must be an integer, we need to find the largest integer less than or equal to $71\\frac{5}{14}$, which is 71.\nStep 7:  Now that we have the common difference, we can find the sum of the 15 terms using the formula: $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$, where $S_n$ is the sum of the first $n$ terms, $a_1$ is the first term, and $a_n$ is the last term.\nStep 8:  Plugging in the values, we get: $S_{15} = \\frac{15}{2}(0 + 999) = \\frac{15}{2}(999) = 7477.5$.\nStep 9:  However, since the sum must be an integer, we need to find the largest integer less than or equal to $7477.5$, which is 7477.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the largest possible sum of the 15 answers is $\\boxed{7477}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7477}$",

The circles intersect at points $A$ and $C$, and point $B$ lies on $\\omega_{2}$ such that $B A=37, B O=17$, and $B C=7$.\nStep 3:  First, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of $O A$. We have $O A^2 = B A^2 - B O^2 = 37^2 - 17^2 = 1369 - 289 = 1080$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $O A = \\sqrt{1080} = 6 \\sqrt{30}$.\nStep 4:  Next, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem again to find the length of $O C$. We have $O C^2 = B C^2 - B O^2 = 7^2 - 17^2 = 49 - 289 = -240$. However, since $O C$ is a distance, it must be positive, so we take the positive square root, which gives us $O C = \\sqrt{240} = 4 \\sqrt{60}$.\nStep 5:  Now, we can use the formula for the area of a circle, which is $\\pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle. We have the radius $O A = 6 \\sqrt{30}$, so the area of $\\omega_{1}$ is $\\pi (6 \\sqrt{30})^2 = \\pi \\cdot 6^2 \\cdot 30 = 1080 \\pi$.\nStep 6:  Therefore, the area of $\\omega_{1}$ is $\\boxed{1080 \\pi}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1080 \\pi}$",

Since $b$ must be an integer, the largest possible value of $b$ is $6$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the possible values of $b$ are $7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211, 212, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217, 218, 219, 220, 221, 222, 223, 224, 225, 226, 227, 228, 229, 230, 231, 232, 233, 234, 235, 236, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241, 242, 243, 244, 245, 246, 247, 248, 249, 250, 251, 252, 253, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 259, 260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269, 270, 271, 272, 273, 274, 275, 276, 277, 278, 279, 280, 281, 282, 283, 284, 285, 286, 287, 288, 289, 290, 291, 292, 293, 294, 295, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 308, 309, 310, 311, 312, 313, 314, 315, 316, 317, 318, 319, 320, 321, 322, 323, 324, 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, 330, 331, 332, 333, 334, 335, 336, 337, 338, 339, 340, 341, 342, 343, 344, 345, 346, 347, 348, 349, 350, 351, 352, 353, 354, 355, 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361, 362, 363, 364, 365, 366, 367, 368, 369, 370, 371, 372, 373, 374, 375, 376, 377, 378, 379, 380, 381, 382, 383, 384, 385, 386, 387, 388, 389, 390, 391, 392, 393, 394, 395, 396, 397, 398, 399, 400, 401, 402, 403, 404, 405, 406, 407, 408, 409, 410, 411, 412, 413, 414, 415, 416, 417, 418, 419, 420, 421, 422, 423, 424, 425, 426, 427, 428, 429, 430, 431, 432, 433, 434, 435, 436, 437, 438, 439, 440, 441, 442, 443, 444, 445, 446, 447, 448, 449, 450, 451, 452, 453, 454, 455, 456, 457, 458, 459, 460, 461, 462, 463, 464, 465, 466, 467, 468, 469, 470, 471, 472, 473, 474, 475, 476, 477, 478, 479, 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488, 489, 490, 491, 492, 493, 494, 495, 496, 497, 498, 499, 500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 505, 506, 507, 508, 509, 510, 511, 512, 513, 514, 515, 516, 517, 518, 519, 520, 521, 522, 523, 524, 525, 526, 527, 528, 529, 530, 531, 532, 533, 534, 535, 536, 537, 538, 539, 540, 541, 542, 543, 544, 545, 546, 547, 548, 549, 550, 551, 552, 553, 554, 555, 556, 557, 558, 559, 560,",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first understand the given information and what is being asked. We are given a right-angled triangle $ABC$ with a right angle at $C$ and $AB = 40$. We are also given that $AC - BC = T - 1$, where $T = 35$.\nStep 2:  The problem asks us to find the area of triangle $ABC$, denoted as $[ABC]$.\nStep 3:  We can start by using the Pythagorean Theorem to relate the sides of the triangle. The theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\nStep 4:  In this case, we have $AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2$. We are given that $AB = 40$, so we can substitute this value into the equation to get $40^2 = AC^2 + BC^2$.\nStep 5:  We are also given that $AC - BC = T - 1$, where $T = 35$. Substituting this value, we get $AC - BC = 35 - 1 = 34$.\nStep 6:  We can use the equation $AC - BC = 34$ to express $AC$ in terms of $BC$. This gives us $AC = BC + 34$.\nStep 7:  Substituting this expression for $AC$ into the Pythagorean Theorem equation, we get $40^2 = (BC + 34)^2 + BC^2$.\nStep 8:  Expanding and simplifying this equation, we get $1600 = 2BC^2 + 68BC + 1156$.\nStep 9:  Rearranging the terms, we get $2BC^2 + 68BC - 444 = 0$.\nStep 10:  We can solve this quadratic equation to find the value of $BC$.\nStep 11:  Once we have the value of $BC$, we can find the value of $AC$ using the equation $AC = BC + 34$.\nStep 12:  Finally, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle, which is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$, to find the area of triangle $ABC$.\nStep 13:  The base of the triangle is $AB = 40$, and the height is $BC$.\nStep 14:  Therefore, the area of triangle $ABC$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 40 \\times BC$.\nStep 15:  We can now substitute the value of $BC$ into this expression to find the final answer.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{420}$",

The change-of-base formula states that $\\log _{a} b = \\frac{\\log _{c} b}{\\log _{c} a}$ for any positive real numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$ where $c \\neq 1$.\nStep 3:  Applying this formula to our given equation, we get $\\log _{\\sqrt{2}} x = \\frac{\\log _{2} x}{\\log _{2} \\sqrt{2}}$.\nStep 4:  We know that $\\log _{2} \\sqrt{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$, so we can simplify the equation to $\\log _{\\sqrt{2}} x = 2 \\log _{2} x$.\nStep 5:  Given that $\\log _{\\sqrt{2}} x = 20$, we can equate this to $2 \\log _{2} x$ and solve for $\\log _{2} x$. This gives us $\\log _{2} x = 10$.\nStep 6:  Now, we need to find the value of $\\log _{2} \\sqrt{x}$. We can use the property of logarithms that states $\\log _{a} b^c = c \\log _{a} b$.\nStep 7:  Applying this property, we get $\\log _{2} \\sqrt{x} = \\log _{2} x^{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\log _{2} x$.\nStep 8:  Substituting the value of $\\log _{2} x$ we found earlier, we get $\\log _{2} \\sqrt{x} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 10 = 5$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the value of $\\log _{2} \\sqrt{x}$ is $\\boxed{5}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first understand the possible outcomes when Hannah and Otto flip their coins.\nStep 2:  Hannah flips two fair coins, which means she can get either 0, 1, or 2 heads. On the other hand, Otto flips $T=5$ fair coins, so he can get 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 heads.\nStep 3:  We are interested in finding the probability that the number of heads showing on Hannah's coins is greater than the number of heads showing on Otto's coins.\nStep 4:  To approach this, we need to consider the different scenarios where Hannah gets more heads than Otto.\nStep 5:  If Hannah gets 2 heads, then Otto must get 0 or 1 heads for Hannah to have more heads. This can occur in $\\dbinom{5}{0} + \\dbinom{5}{1} = 6$ ways.\nStep 6:  If Hannah gets 1 head, then Otto must get 0 heads for Hannah to have more heads. This can occur in $\\dbinom{5}{0} = 1$ way.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the total number of successful outcomes is $6 + 1 = 7$.\nStep 8:  The total number of possible outcomes for Hannah and Otto is $2^2 \\cdot 2^5 = 64$.\nStep 9:  So, the probability $p$ is $\\frac{7}{64}$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, $q+r = 7+64 = \\boxed{71}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{71}$",

Let's assume that the number of 20-edwah bills is represented by $x$ and the number of 80-edwah bills is represented by $y$.\nStep 3:  The total value of the bills in Janet's wallet can be expressed as $20x + 80y$, and the average value of each bill is given by $\\frac{20x + 80y}{x + y}$.\nStep 4:  We are given that the average value of each bill is $2T$ edwahs, which is equal to $34$ edwahs. Therefore, we can set up the equation $\\frac{20x + 80y}{x + y} = 34$.\nStep 5:  Multiplying both sides of the equation by $x + y$, we get $20x + 80y = 34x + 34y$.\nStep 6:  Rearranging the terms, we have $14x = 46y$.\nStep 7:  To find the smallest possible value of the bills in Janet's wallet, we need to find the smallest values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the equation $14x = 46y$.\nStep 8:  Since $14$ and $46$ are both even numbers, we can divide both sides of the equation by $2$ to simplify it to $7x = 23y$.\nStep 9:  We can see that the smallest possible values for $x$ and $y$ that satisfy this equation are $x = 23$ and $y = 7$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the smallest possible value of the bills in Janet's wallet is $20 \\cdot 23 + 80 \\cdot 7 = 460 + 560 = 1020$ edwahs.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1020}$",

This allows us to rewrite the expression as $100000(1 + 0.002)^{10}$.\nStep 4:  Using the binomial theorem, we can expand $(1 + 0.002)^{10}$ to get $1 + \\binom{10}{1} (0.002) + \\binom{10}{2} (0.002)^2 + \\dots + (0.002)^{10}$.\nStep 5:  We can then simplify this expression to get $1 + 0.02 + 0.0002 + \\dots + (0.002)^{10}$.\nStep 6:  This is a geometric series with first term $1$, common ratio $0.002$, and $11$ terms.\nStep 7:  The sum of a geometric series can be calculated using the formula $S_n = \\frac{a(1 - r^n)}{1 - r}$, where $a$ is the first term, $r$ is the common ratio, and $n$ is the number of terms.\nStep 8:  Substituting the values, we get $1 + 0.02 + 0.0002 + \\dots + (0.002)^{10} = \\frac{1 - (0.002)^{11}}{1 - 0.002}$.\nStep 9:  Simplifying this expression, we get $\\frac{1 - (0.002)^{11}}{1 - 0.002} = \\frac{1 - 0.000000002}{0.998} = \\frac{0.999999998}{0.998}$.\nStep 10:  Multiplying this by $100000$, we get $100000 \\cdot \\frac{0.999999998}{0.998} = 100000 \\cdot 1.0009999998$.\nStep 11:  Finally, taking the floor of this value, we get $\\left\\lfloor 100000(1.002)^{10}\\right\\rfloor = \\boxed{100001}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{100001}$",
  "Problem: If $1, x, y$ is a geometric sequence and $x, y, 3$ is an arithmetic sequence, compute the maximum value of $x+y$. Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of geometric and arithmetic sequences.\nStep 2:  A geometric sequence is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio. In this case, the sequence $1, x, y$ is a geometric sequence, so we have $y = x^2$.\nStep 3:  An arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers such that the difference between any two successive members is a constant. Here, the sequence $x, y, 3$ is an arithmetic sequence, so we have $y - x = 3 - y$, which simplifies to $2y = x + 3$.\nStep 4:  We are asked to find the maximum value of $x + y$. To do this, we can express $x + y$ in terms of $x$ using the equation $y = x^2$ and the equation $2y = x + 3$.\nStep 5:  Substituting $y = x^2$ into $2y = x + 3$, we get $2x^2 = x + 3$, which simplifies to $2x^2 - x - 3 = 0$.\nStep 6:  We can solve this quadratic equation for $x$ using the quadratic formula: $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a = 2$, $b = -1$, and $c = -3$.\nStep 7:  Plugging in these values, we get $x = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 24}}{4} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{25}}{4} = \\frac{1 \\pm 5}{4}$.\nStep 8:  This gives us two possible values for $x$: $x = \\frac{1 + 5}{4} = \\frac{6}{4} = \\frac{3}{2}$ and $x = \\frac{1 - 5}{4} = \\frac{-4}{4} = -1$.\nStep 9:  We can then find the corresponding values of $y$ using the equation $y = x^2$. For $x = \\frac{3}{2}$, we have $y = \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{9}{4}$, and for $x = -1$, we have $y = (-1)^2 = 1$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the possible values of $x + y$ are $\\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{9}{4} = \\frac{6}{4} + \\frac{9}{4} = \\frac{15}{4}$ and $-1 + 1 = 0$.\nStep 11:  The maximum value of $x + y$ is $\\frac{15}{4}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{15}{4}}$",
  "## Step 1: Understand the sequence definition\nThe sequence $\\left\\{a_{n}\\right\\}$ is defined recursively. The first term $a_{1}$ is given as 1. For any term $a_{n}$ where $n \\geq 2$, it is defined as the smallest possible positive value of $n-a_{k}^{2}$, where $1 \\leq k < n$.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the pattern of the sequence\nTo find the pattern, let's calculate the first few terms of the sequence:\n- $a_{1} = 1$\n- $a_{2} = 2 - 1^2 = 1$\n- $a_{3} = 3 - 1^2 = 2$\n- $a_{4} = 4 - 1^2 = 3$\n- $a_{5} = 5 - 1^2 = 4$\n- $a_{6} = 6 - 2^2 = 2$\n- $a_{7} = 7 - 2^2 = 3$\n- $a_{8} = 8 - 2^2 = 4$\n- $a_{9} = 9 - 2^2 = 7$\n- $a_{10} = 10 - 3^2 = 1$\n- $a_{11} = 11 - 3^2 = 2$\n- $a_{12} = 12 - 3^2 = 3$\n- $a_{13} = 13 - 3^2 = 4$\n- $a_{14} = 14 - 3^2 = 5$\n- $a_{15} = 15 - 3^2 = 6$\n- $a_{16} = 16 - 4^2 = 0$ (This is not a positive value, so we need to consider the next smallest $k$)\n- $a_{16} = 16 - 3^2 = 7$\n- $a_{17} = 17 - 4^2 = 1$\n- $a_{18} = 18 - 4^2 = 2$\n- $a_{19} = 19 - 4^2 = 3$\n- $a_{20} = 20 - 4^2 = 4$\n- $a_{21} = 21 - 4^2 = 5$\n- $a_{22} = 22 - 4^2 = 6$\n- $a_{23} = 23 - 4^2 = 7$\n- $a_{24} = 24 - 4^2 = 8$\n- $a_{25} = 25 - 5^2 = 0$ (This is not a positive value, so we need to consider the next smallest $k$)\n- $a_{25} = 25 - 4^2 = 9$\n- $a_{26} = 26 - 5^2 = 1$\n- $a_{27} = 27 - 5^2 = 2$\n- $a_{28} = 28 - 5^2 = 3$\n- $a_{29} = 29 - 5^2 = 4$\n- $a_{30} = 30 - 5^2 = 5$\n- $a_{31} = 31 - 5^2 = 6$\n- $a_{32} = 32 - 5^2 = 7$\n- $a_{33} = 33 - 5^2 = 8$\n- $a_{34} = 34 - 5^2 = 9$\n- $a_{35} = 35 - 5^2 = 10$\n- $a_{36} = 36 - 6^2 = 0$ (This is not a positive value, so we need to consider the next smallest $k$)\n- $a_{36} = 36 - 5^2 = 11$\n- $a_{37} = 37 - 6^2 = 1$\n- $a_{38} = 38 - 6^2 = 2$\n- $a_{39} = 39 - 6^2 = 3$\n- $a_{40} = 40 - 6^2 = 4$\n- $a_{41} = 41 - 6^2 = 5$\n- $a_{42} = 42 - 6^2 = 6$\n- $a_{43} = 43 - 6^2 = 7$\n- $a_{44} = 44 - 6^2 = 8$\n- $a_{45} = 45 - 6^2 = 9$\n- $a_{46} = 46 - 6^2 = 10$\n- $a_{47} = 47 - 6^2 = 11$\n- $a_{48} = 48 - 6^2 = 12$\n- $a_{49} = 49 - 7^2 = 0$ (This is not a positive value, so we need to consider the next smallest $k$)\n- $a_{49} = 49 - 6^2 = 13$\n- $a_{50} = 50 - 7^2 = 1$\n\n## Step 3: Identify the pattern\nFrom the calculations, we can see that the sequence repeats in a pattern of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and then resets. This pattern repeats every 12 terms.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the sum of the first 50 terms\nSince the pattern repeats every 12 terms, we can calculate the sum of the first 12 terms and then multiply it by 4 (since 50 divided by 12 is 4 with a remainder of 2). The sum of the first 12 terms is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 = 78. Multiplying this by 4 gives 78 * 4 = 312. Then, we need to add the sum of the first 2 terms of the next pattern, which is 1 + 2 = 3.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the final sum\nThe final sum is 312 + 3 = 315.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{315}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to consider the different ways in which we can extend three sides of a regular 16-gon to form a triangle.\nStep 2:  First, we note that the 16-gon has 16 vertices, and extending three sides to form a triangle means choosing three of these vertices as the vertices of the triangle.\nStep 3:  However, we are not allowed to choose any of the original vertices of the 16-gon, so we need to select three vertices from the remaining points on the extended sides.\nStep 4:  We can think of this as placing three points on the extended sides of the 16-gon, and then forming a triangle with these points.\nStep 5:  The key observation here is that the order in which we place the points does not matter, as the resulting triangle will be the same regardless of the order in which the points were chosen.\nStep 6:  Therefore, we can treat this as a combination problem, where we need to choose 3 points out of the 16 extended points.\nStep 7:  The number of ways to choose 3 points out of 16 is given by the combination formula $\\binom{16}{3} = \\frac{16!}{3!(16-3)!} = \\frac{16 \\times 15 \\times 14}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 560$.\nStep 8:  However, not all of these combinations will result in noncongruent triangles. We need to consider the cases where the three points are collinear, which means they lie on the same line.\nStep 9:  If the three points are collinear, then the triangle formed by connecting them will be a degenerate triangle, and it will not be a valid noncongruent triangle.\nStep 10:  To count the number of collinear sets of three points, we can consider the different ways in which three points can be collinear.\nStep 11:  There are 16 ways to choose a side of the 16-gon, and for each side, there are 4 ways to choose three points on that side.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the total number of collinear sets of three points is $16 \\times 4 = 64$.\nStep 13:  Subtracting the number of collinear sets from the total number of combinations gives us the number of noncongruent triangles that can be formed.\nStep 14:  Therefore, the number of noncongruent triangles is $560 - 64 = \\boxed{496}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{496}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given scenario. We have two square tiles, each with an area of 9, placed one on top of the other. The top tile is then rotated about its center by an acute angle $\\theta$. We are asked to find the value of $\\sin \\theta+\\cos \\theta$ given that the area of the overlapping region is 8.\nStep 2:  The first step is to visualize the scenario and understand the geometric properties involved. We can represent the side length of the square tiles as $s$. Since the area of each square is 9, we have $s^2=9$, which gives us $s=3$.\nStep 3:  Next, we need to find the area of the overlapping region. This can be done by considering the overlap as a rectangle with a base of $3\\sin \\theta$ and a height of $3\\cos \\theta$. The area of this rectangle is given by the product of its base and height, which is $3^2\\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta=9\\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta$. We are given that this area is equal to 8, so we have the equation $9\\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta=8$.\nStep 4:  We can use the trigonometric identity $\\sin 2\\theta=2\\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta$ to rewrite the equation as $\\frac{4}{3}\\sin 2\\theta=8$. Solving for $\\sin 2\\theta$, we get $\\sin 2\\theta=6$.\nStep 5:  However, we know that the sine function is bounded between -1 and 1, so $\\sin 2\\theta$ cannot be greater than 1. This means that our initial assumption of $\\sin 2\\theta=6$ is incorrect.\nStep 6:  Let's re-examine the problem and consider the overlap as a trapezoid instead of a rectangle. The area of the trapezoid can be calculated using the formula for the area of a trapezoid, which is $\\frac{1}{2}h(b_1+b_2)$, where $h$ is the height and $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the lengths of the two bases.\nStep 7:  In this case, the height of the trapezoid is $3\\cos \\theta$, and the lengths of the two bases are $3$ and $3\\sin \\theta$. Therefore, the area of the trapezoid is $\\frac{1}{2}(3\\cos \\theta)(3+3\\sin \\theta)=\\frac{9}{2}(1+\\sin \\theta)\\cos \\theta$.\nStep 8:  We are given that this area is equal to 8, so we have the equation $\\frac{9}{2}(1+\\sin \\theta)\\cos \\theta=8$. Solving for $\\sin \\theta+\\cos \\theta$, we get $\\sin \\theta+\\cos \\theta=\\frac{16}{9}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{16}{9}}$",

This means that for a three-digit number $\\underline{a} \\underline{b} \\underline{c}$, the sum $a+b+c$ must be divisible by 9 for the number to be divisible by 9.\nStep 3:  Given the numbers $M=\\underline{4} \\underline{A} \\underline{6}$ and $N=\\underline{1} \\underline{B} \\underline{7}$, we are told that neither $M$ nor $N$ is divisible by 9. This implies that the sum of the digits in each number is not divisible by 9.\nStep 4:  We are also given that the product $M \\cdot N$ is divisible by 9. This means that the sum of the digits in the product $M \\cdot N$ must be divisible by 9.\nStep 5:  To find the largest possible value of $A+B$, we need to consider the possible values of $A$ and $B$ that satisfy the given conditions.\nStep 6:  We can start by finding the possible values of $A$ and $B$ such that $M$ and $N$ are not divisible by 9, but their product is divisible by 9.\nStep 7:  We can then calculate the sum of the digits in the product $M \\cdot N$ and find the largest possible value of $A+B$ that satisfies the given conditions.\nStep 8:  By considering all possible values of $A$ and $B$, we can determine the largest possible value of $A+B$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{17}$",

Therefore, we can find the measure of each interior angle by dividing the total sum of the interior angles by the number of sides, which is 12.\nStep 5:  So, the measure of each interior angle is $d = \\frac{1800^{\\circ}}{12} = 150^{\\circ}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{150}$",

We can express this as $rs + r + s + 1$.\nStep 7:  Substituting the values of $r+s$ and $rs$ obtained from Vieta's formulas, we get $(r+1)(s+1)=\\frac{F_{k+2}}{F_{k}}+\\left(-\\frac{F_{k+1}}{F_{k}}\\right)+1$.\nStep 8:  Simplifying this expression, we get $(r+1)(s+1)=\\frac{F_{k+2}-F_{k+1}+F_{k}}{F_{k}}$.\nStep 9:  We know that the Fibonacci sequence has the property that $F_{n+2}=F_{n+1}+F_{n}$ for all non-negative integers $n$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, we can simplify the expression further to get $(r+1)(s+1)=\\frac{F_{k+2}-F_{k+1}+F_{k}}{F_{k}}=\\frac{F_{k+1}+F_{k}}{F_{k}}$.\nStep 11:  Finally, we can simplify this expression to get $(r+1)(s+1)=\\frac{F_{k+1}}{F_{k}}+1$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the value of $(r+1)(s+1)$ is $\\frac{F_{k+1}}{F_{k}}+1$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{F_{k+1}}{F_{k}}+1}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the number of sides of a polygon and the sum of its interior angles.\nStep 2:  The sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon can be calculated using the formula $(n-2) \\cdot 180^\\circ$.\nStep 3:  We are given that the sum of the interior angles of the $n$-gon is equal to the sum of the interior angles of a pentagon plus the sum of the interior angles of an octagon.\nStep 4:  The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is $(5-2) \\cdot 180^\\circ = 3 \\cdot 180^\\circ = 540^\\circ$.\nStep 5:  The sum of the interior angles of an octagon is $(8-2) \\cdot 180^\\circ = 6 \\cdot 180^\\circ = 1080^\\circ$.\nStep 6:  Therefore, the sum of the interior angles of the $n$-gon is $540^\\circ + 1080^\\circ = 1620^\\circ$.\nStep 7:  We can now set up the equation $(n-2) \\cdot 180^\\circ = 1620^\\circ$ to solve for $n$.\nStep 8:  Dividing both sides of the equation by $180^\\circ$, we get $n-2 = \\frac{1620^\\circ}{180^\\circ} = 9$.\nStep 9:  Adding $2$ to both sides of the equation, we find that $n = 9 + 2 = 11$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the value of $n$ is $\\boxed{11}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{11}$"
