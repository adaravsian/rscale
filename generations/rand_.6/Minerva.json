  "Problem: Each of the two Magellan telescopes has a diameter of $6.5 \\mathrm{~m}$. In one configuration the effective focal length is $72 \\mathrm{~m}$. Find the diameter of the image of a planet (in $\\mathrm{cm}$ ) at this focus if the angular diameter of the planet at the time of the observation is $45^{\\prime \\prime}$. Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of angular diameter and the relationship between the angular diameter, the focal length, and the diameter of the image.\nStep 2:  First, we need to convert the angular diameter of the planet from arcseconds to radians. We know that $1^{\\prime \\prime} = \\frac{1}{3600} \\pi$ radians, so $45^{\\prime \\prime} = \\frac{45}{3600} \\pi$ radians.\nStep 3:  The angular diameter of the planet is related to the diameter of the image by the equation: $\\theta=\\frac{d}{f}$, where $\\theta$ is the angular diameter, $d$ is the diameter of the image, and $f$ is the focal length.\nStep 4:  We are given that the effective focal length is $72 \\mathrm{~m}$ and the angular diameter of the planet is $\\frac{45}{3600} \\pi$ radians. We can use these values to find the diameter of the image.\nStep 5:  Rearranging the equation to solve for the diameter of the image, we get: $d=\\theta f$. Substituting the given values, we have: $d=\\left(\\frac{45}{3600} \\pi\\right)(72)$.\nStep 6:  Now, we can calculate the diameter of the image by evaluating the expression: $d=\\left(\\frac{45}{3600} \\pi\\right)(72)$.\nStep 7:  After performing the calculation, we find that the diameter of the image is $0.18 \\mathrm{~m}$.\nStep 8:  Finally, we need to convert the diameter of the image from meters to centimeters. Since $1 \\mathrm{~m} = 100 \\mathrm{~cm}$, we can convert $0.18 \\mathrm{~m}$ to centimeters by multiplying by $100$, giving us a diameter of $18 \\mathrm{~cm}$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the diameter of the image of the planet at the focus is $18 \\mathrm{~cm}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{18}$",

  "Step 1:  To find the critical angle for the light to be internally reflected at $H$, we need to consider the refraction of light as it passes from the glass into the air.\nStep 2:  The critical angle is the angle of incidence above which total internal reflection occurs. This happens when the angle of refraction is $90^{\\circ}$.\nStep 3:  We can use Snell's law to relate the angles of incidence and refraction to the indices of refraction of the two media involved.\nStep 4:  Snell's law states that $n_1 \\sin \\theta_1 = n_2 \\sin \\theta_2$, where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the indices of refraction of the two media, and $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$ are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.\nStep 5:  In this case, the light is passing from the glass into the air, so we have $n_1 = 1.5$ for the glass and $n_2 = 1$ for the air.\nStep 6:  We want to find the critical angle, which is the angle of incidence in the glass that results in an angle of refraction of $90^{\\circ}$ in the air.\nStep 7:  Using Snell's law, we can write $\\sin \\theta_c = \\frac{n_2}{n_1} \\sin 90^{\\circ}$, where $\\theta_c$ is the critical angle.\nStep 8:  Substituting the values, we get $\\sin \\theta_c = \\frac{1}{1.5} \\sin 90^{\\circ} = \\frac{1}{1.5} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{2}{3}$.\nStep 9:  To find the critical angle, we take the inverse sine of $\\frac{2}{3}$, which gives us $\\theta_c = \\sin^{-1} \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)$.\nStep 10:  Evaluating this expression, we get $\\theta_c \\approx 41.81^{\\circ}$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the critical angle for the light to be internally reflected at $H$ is approximately $41.81^{\\circ}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{41.8}$",
  "Problem: A particular star has an absolute magnitude $M=-7$. If this star is observed in a galaxy that is at a distance of $3 \\mathrm{Mpc}$, what will its apparent magnitude be?\nStep 1:  To solve this problem, we need to use the relationship between absolute magnitude, apparent magnitude, and distance.\nStep 2:  The formula that connects these three quantities is: $m = M + 5 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{d}{10} \\right)$, where $m$ is the apparent magnitude, $M$ is the absolute magnitude, and $d$ is the distance in parsecs.\nStep 3:  Given that the absolute magnitude $M = -7$ and the distance $d = 3 \\mathrm{Mpc}$, we can substitute these values into the formula to find the apparent magnitude $m$.\nStep 4:  First, we need to convert the distance from megaparsecs to parsecs. Since $1 \\mathrm{Mpc} = 10^6 \\mathrm{pc}$, the distance $d = 3 \\mathrm{Mpc} = 3 \\times 10^6 \\mathrm{pc}$.\nStep 5:  Now, we can substitute the values into the formula: $m = -7 + 5 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{3 \\times 10^6}{10} \\right)$.\nStep 6:  Simplifying the expression inside the logarithm, we get: $m = -7 + 5 \\log_{10} (3 \\times 10^5)$.\nStep 7:  Using the property of logarithms that $\\log_{10} (ab) = \\log_{10} a + \\log_{10} b$, we can rewrite the expression as: $m = -7 + 5 (\\log_{10} 3 + \\log_{10} 10^5)$.\nStep 8:  Since $\\log_{10} 10^5 = 5$, the expression simplifies to: $m = -7 + 5 (\\log_{10} 3 + 5)$.\nStep 9:  Further simplifying, we get: $m = -7 + 5 \\log_{10} 3 + 25$.\nStep 10:  Combining the constants, we have: $m = 18 + 5 \\log_{10} 3$.\nStep 11:  Now, we need to calculate the value of $5 \\log_{10} 3$.\nStep 12:  Using a calculator, we find that $\\log_{10} 3 \\approx 0.477$.\nStep 13:  Multiplying this value by 5, we get: $5 \\log_{10} 3 \\approx 2.385$.\nStep 14:  Finally, adding this value to 18, we find the apparent magnitude: $m \\approx 20.385$.\nStep 15:  Therefore, the apparent magnitude of the star is approximately $20.385$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{20.385}$",
  "Step 1:  To find the gravitational acceleration due to the Sun at the location of the Earth's orbit, we can use the formula for gravitational force between two objects, which is given by $F = G \\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$, where $G$ is the gravitational constant, $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses of the two objects, and $r$ is the distance between their centers.\nStep 2:  In this case, we're interested in the gravitational force exerted by the Sun on an object of mass $m$ at a distance of $1 \\mathrm{AU}$ from the Sun. We can use the formula for gravitational force to find the acceleration due to the Sun's gravity.\nStep 3:  The mass of the Sun is approximately $1.989 \\times 10^{30} \\mathrm{kg}$, and the gravitational constant $G$ is $6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\mathrm{Nm^2/kg^2}$.\nStep 4:  We're given that the distance $r$ is $1 \\mathrm{AU}$, which is equal to $1.496 \\times 10^{11} \\mathrm{m}$.\nStep 5:  Plugging these values into the formula for gravitational force, we get $F = G \\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} = (6.674 \\times 10^{-11}) \\frac{(1.989 \\times 10^{30})(m)}{(1.496 \\times 10^{11})^2}$.\nStep 6:  Simplifying this expression, we find that $F = \\frac{G m_1 m_2}{r^2} = \\frac{(6.674 \\times 10^{-11})(1.989 \\times 10^{30})(m)}{(1.496 \\times 10^{11})^2} = 5.9 \\times 10^{24} m$.\nStep 7:  The gravitational acceleration due to the Sun is then given by $a = \\frac{F}{m} = \\frac{5.9 \\times 10^{24}}{m}$.\nStep 8:  To find the numerical value of the gravitational acceleration, we need to know the mass of the object $m$. However, since we're asked to express the answer to one significant figure, we can assume a mass of $1 \\mathrm{kg}$ for the object.\nStep 9:  Substituting this value into the expression for gravitational acceleration, we get $a = \\frac{5.9 \\times 10^{24}}{1} = 5.9 \\times 10^{24} \\mathrm{m/s^2}$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the gravitational acceleration due to the Sun at the location of the Earth's orbit is $5.9 \\times 10^{24} \\mathrm{m/s^2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6000000000000000000}$",
  "## Step 1: Recall Snell's law\nSnell's law states that the ratio of the sines of the angles of incidence and refraction is equal to the ratio of the velocities of the two media, or equivalently, the inverse ratio of the indices of refraction. Mathematically, this can be expressed as $n_1 \\sin{\\theta_1} = n_2 \\sin{\\theta_2}$, where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the indices of refraction of the first and second media, respectively, and $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$ are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.\n\n## Step 2: Apply Snell's law to the given problem\nIn this problem, the light is incident on the water surface at an angle $\\theta_w$ with respect to the surface normal. The index of refraction of water is given as $n=1.3$. We want to find the angle of the light once it emerges from the water into the air, $\\theta_a$. Using Snell's law, we have $1.3 \\sin{\\theta_w} = \\sin{\\theta_a}$.\n\n## Step 3: Solve for $\\theta_a$\nTo find the expression for $\\theta_a$ in terms of $\\theta_w$, we can rearrange the equation from Step 2 to isolate $\\sin{\\theta_a}$. This gives us $\\sin{\\theta_a} = 1.3 \\sin{\\theta_w}$. To find $\\theta_a$, we take the inverse sine of both sides, which gives us $\\theta_a = \\arcsin{1.3 \\sin{\\theta_w}}$.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the critical angle\nThe critical angle is the critical value of $\\theta_w$ such that the light will not emerge from the water. This occurs when $\\sin{\\theta_a} = 1$, since the sine of the angle of refraction is equal to 1 when the angle of refraction is 90 degrees. Using Snell's law, we have $1.3 \\sin{\\theta_w} = 1$. To find the critical value of $\\theta_w$, we can rearrange this equation to isolate $\\sin{\\theta_w}$, which gives us $\\sin{\\theta_w} = \\frac{1}{1.3}$. To find $\\theta_w$, we take the inverse sine of both sides, which gives us $\\theta_w = \\arcsin{\\frac{1}{1.3}}$.\n\n## Step 5: Write the final answer\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\arcsin{1.3 \\sin{\\theta_w}}}$",
  "Step 1:  To find the theoretical limiting angular resolution of the telescope, we can use the Rayleigh criterion, which states that the minimum angle $\\theta$ between two point sources that can be resolved is given by $\\theta=1.22 \\frac{\\lambda}{D}$, where $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of light and $D$ is the diameter of the telescope.\nStep 2:  Given that the diameter of the telescope is $8$ inches, we need to convert this to meters to ensure consistency with the units of the wavelength. Since $1 \\mathrm{~inch}=2.54 \\mathrm{~cm}$, the diameter in meters is $8 \\times 2.54 \\times 10^{-2} \\mathrm{~m}=0.2032 \\mathrm{~m}$.\nStep 3:  The wavelength of light in the visible spectrum is given as $\\lambda=5000 \\AA=500 \\mathrm{~nm}=5 \\times 10^{-5} \\mathrm{~cm}=5 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~m}$.\nStep 4:  Now, we can substitute these values into the Rayleigh criterion formula to find the limiting angular resolution.\nStep 5:  Plugging in the values, we get $\\theta=1.22 \\frac{5 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~m}}{0.2032 \\mathrm{~m}}$.\nStep 6:  Simplifying this expression, we find $\\theta=3.01 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~rad}$.\nStep 7:  To convert this to arcseconds, we use the conversion factor $1 \\mathrm{~rad} \\approx 206265 \\mathrm{~arcsec}$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the limiting angular resolution in arcseconds is $\\theta \\approx 3.01 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~rad} \\times 206265 \\mathrm{~arcsec / rad} \\approx 0.0062 \\mathrm{~arcsec}$.\nStep 9:  Rounding to two significant figures, the limiting angular resolution is approximately $0.0062 \\mathrm{~arcsec}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0.0062}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of magnitude and how it relates to the brightness of celestial objects.\nStep 2:  The magnitude of an object is a measure of its brightness, with lower magnitudes indicating brighter objects. The difference in magnitude between two objects is related to the ratio of their brightnesses.\nStep 3:  We are given that the extrasolar planet has a surface area that is $2 \\%$ of that of its parent star. This means that the planet contributes $2 \\%$ of the light of the parent star.\nStep 4:  The decrease in magnitude of the system during transits can be calculated using the formula: $\\Delta m = -2.5 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{F_{\\text{planet}}}{F_{\\text{star}}} \\right)$, where $F_{\\text{planet}}$ is the flux of the planet and $F_{\\text{star}}$ is the flux of the star.\nStep 5:  Since the planet is dark, its flux is negligible compared to the flux of the star. Therefore, we can approximate the ratio of the fluxes as $\\frac{F_{\\text{planet}}}{F_{\\text{star}}} = 0.02$.\nStep 6:  Substituting this value into the formula, we get: $\\Delta m = -2.5 \\log_{10} (0.02)$.\nStep 7:  Evaluating the logarithm, we find that $\\log_{10} (0.02) = -1.7$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the decrease in magnitude of the system during transits is: $\\Delta m = -2.5 \\times (-1.7) = 3.25$.\nStep 9:  So, the final answer is: $\\boxed{3.25}$",

We are dealing with a star that has a Doppler shifted spectral line from oxygen, indicating that it is moving relative to the Earth. We are also given the proper motion of the star, which is the rate at which it appears to move against the background of more distant stars.\nStep 2:  The first step is to calculate the velocity of the star along the line of sight to the Earth. We can use the Doppler shift formula to find this velocity. The Doppler shift formula is given by $\\frac{\\Delta \\lambda}{\\lambda} = \\frac{v}{c}$, where $\\Delta \\lambda$ is the change in wavelength, $\\lambda$ is the rest wavelength, $v$ is the velocity of the star, and $c$ is the speed of light.\nStep 3:  We are given that the rest wavelength of the oxygen line is $5007 \\AA$ and the Doppler shifted wavelength is $5012 \\AA$.

The difference between these two magnitudes is related to the distance to the object through the formula: $m - M = 5 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{d}{10} \\right)$, where $m$ is the apparent magnitude, $M$ is the absolute magnitude, and $d$ is the distance in parsecs.\nStep 3:  Given that the absolute magnitude of the star cluster is the same as that of the Sun, which is +5, and the distance to the cluster is $10 \\mathrm{pc}$, we can use the formula to find the apparent magnitude of the cluster.\nStep 4:  Substituting the given values into the formula, we get: $m - 5 = 5 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{10}{10} \\right)$.

This means we need to find the first and second derivatives of $x(t)$ with respect to $t$.\nStep 3:  The first derivative of $x(t)$ is given by $\\dot{x} = \\dot{u} e^{-t} - u e^{-t}$, and the second derivative is $\\ddot{x} = \\ddot{u} e^{-t} - 2 \\dot{u} e^{-t} + u e^{-t}$.\nStep 4:  Substituting these derivatives into the original differential equation, we get $(\\ddot{u} e^{-t} - 2 \\dot{u} e^{-t} + u e^{-t}) + 3 (\\dot{u} e^{-t} - u e^{-t}) + 2 u e^{-t} = t e^{-t}$.\nStep 5:  Simplifying this expression, we obtain $(\\ddot{u} - 2 \\dot{u} + u) e^{-t} + (\\dot{u} - 3 u) e^{-t} + 2 u e^{-t} = t e^{-t}$.\nStep 6:  Factoring out the common $e^{-t}$ term, we have $(\\ddot{u} - 2 \\dot{u} + u) e^{-t} = t e^{-t}$.\nStep 7:  Dividing both sides by $e^{-t}$, we get $\\ddot{u} - 2 \\dot{u} + u = t$.\nStep 8:  To solve for $u(t)$, we need to find a function whose second derivative minus twice its first derivative plus itself equals $t$.\nStep 9:  We can solve this by first finding the general solution to the homogeneous equation $\\ddot{u} - 2 \\dot{u} + u = 0$, and then finding a particular solution to the nonhomogeneous equation.\nStep 10:  The characteristic equation for the homogeneous equation is $r^2 - 2r + 1 = 0$, which has a repeated root $r=1$. Therefore, the general solution to the homogeneous equation is $u_h(t) = C_1 e^t + C_2 t e^t$.\nStep 11:  To find a particular solution to the nonhomogeneous equation, we can try a function of the form $u_p(t) = A t + B$. Substituting this into the nonhomogeneous equation, we get $(A - 2 A + A) e^t + (A - 3 A + 2 B) e^t + B e^t = t e^t$.\nStep 12:  Simplifying this expression, we obtain $A e^t + (2 B - 2 A) e^t + B e^t = t e^t$.\nStep 13:  Equating coefficients, we get $A = 1$ and $2 B - 2 A + B = 1$. Solving for $B$, we find $B = 1$.\nStep 14:  Therefore, a particular solution to the nonhomogeneous equation is $u_p(t) = t + 1$.\nStep 15:  The general solution to the nonhomogeneous equation is the sum of the general solution to the homogeneous equation and a particular solution to the nonhomogeneous equation, which is $u(t) = C_1 e^t + C_2 t e^t + t + 1$.\nStep 16:  Finally, we can find the solution to the original differential equation by substituting $u(t)$ into the expression $x(t) = u(t) e^{-t}$, giving us $x(t) = (C_1 e^t + C_2 t e^t + t + 1) e^{-t}$.\nStep 17:  Therefore, the solution to the differential equation is $x(t) = (C_1 + C_2 t + t^2 + t) e^{-t}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(C_1 + C_2 t + t^2 + t) e^{-t}}",

  "The age of the universe when most helium nuclei were formed is approximately 1 minute. This is because the universe was still in its early stages of formation, and the process of Big Bang nucleosynthesis occurred very quickly, resulting in the formation of helium nuclei within the first few minutes after the Big Bang. Therefore, the age of the universe when most helium nuclei were formed is approximately 1 minute.\n\nThe age of the universe when hydrogen atoms formed is a different story. Hydrogen atoms formed much later in the universe's history, during the era of recombination, which occurred when the universe had cooled enough for electrons and protons to combine into neutral atoms.
