  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of relative motion and how to calculate the time it takes for Alicia and Beth to meet.\nStep 2:  First, we note that the distance between Cities $A$ and $B$ is $45$ miles. Alicia bikes towards $B$ at a speed of $18$ miles per hour, while Beth bikes towards $A$ at a speed of $12$ miles per hour.\nStep 3:  When they meet, the sum of the distances traveled by Alicia and Beth will be equal to the total distance between the cities, which is $45$ miles.\nStep 4:  Let's denote the time it takes for them to meet as $t$ hours. In this time, Alicia will have traveled a distance of $18t$ miles, and Beth will have traveled a distance of $12t$ miles.\nStep 5:  Since the sum of their distances traveled is equal to the total distance between the cities, we can set up the equation $18t + 12t = 45$ to represent this situation.\nStep 6:  Solving for $t$, we get $30t = 45$, which gives us $t = \\frac{45}{30} = \\frac{3}{2}$ hours.\nStep 7:  Now that we have the time it takes for them to meet, we can calculate the distance traveled by Alicia. The distance traveled by Alicia is given by the product of her speed and the time taken, which is $18 \\times \\frac{3}{2} = 27$ miles.\nStep 8:  Therefore, when they meet, Alicia will be $27$ miles from City $A$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{27}$",

Our goal is to find the value of $x+y$.\nStep 3:  Let's start by examining the second equation, $(y-x)^2=4y^2$. Expanding the left-hand side, we get $y^2-2xy+x^2=4y^2$.\nStep 4:  Rearranging the terms, we have $x^2-2xy-3y^2=0$. This is a quadratic equation in terms of $x$, and we can solve for $x$ using the quadratic formula.\nStep 5:  The quadratic formula states that for an equation of the form $ax^2+bx+c=0$, the solutions are given by $x=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$.\nStep 6:  Applying this to our equation $x^2-2xy-3y^2=0$, we get $x=\\frac{2y\\pm\\sqrt{4y^2+12y^2}}{2}$. Simplifying further, we have $x=\\frac{2y\\pm\\sqrt{16y^2}}{2}$, which reduces to $x=\\frac{2y\\pm4y}{2}$.\nStep 7:  This gives us two possible values for $x$: $x=3y$ or $x=-y$.\nStep 8:  Now, we need to consider the implications of each of these solutions in the context of the given equations.\nStep 9:  If $x=3y$, then substituting this into the first equation $y^3=x^2$, we get $y^3=(3y)^2$, which simplifies to $y^3=9y^2$. Dividing both sides by $y^2$, we obtain $y=9$.\nStep 10:  Substituting $y=9$ back into the equation $x=3y$, we find that $x=27$.\nStep 11:  On the other hand, if $x=-y$, then substituting this into the first equation $y^3=x^2$, we get $y^3=(-y)^2$, which simplifies to $y^3=y^2$. Dividing both sides by $y^2$, we obtain $y=1$.\nStep 12:  Substituting $y=1$ back into the equation $x=-y$, we find that $x=-1$.\nStep 13:  Now, we need to determine which of these solutions satisfies the given conditions.\nStep 14:  We can substitute the values of $x$ and $y$ back into the original equations to check for consistency.\nStep 15:  For the solution $x=27$ and $y=9$, we can verify that it satisfies both equations.\nStep 16:  Similarly, for the solution $x=-1$ and $y=1$, we can verify that it also satisfies both equations.\nStep 17:  Therefore, we have two valid solutions: $(x,y)=(27,9)$ and $(x,y)=(-1,1)$.\nStep 18:  Finally, we need to find the value of $x+y$ for each solution.\nStep 19:  For the solution $(x,y)=(27,9)$, we have $x+y=27+9=36$.\nStep 20:  For the solution $(x,y)=(-1,1)$, we have $x+y=-1+1=0$.\nStep 21:  Therefore, the possible values of $x+y$ are $36$ and $0$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{36}$",

The weight of $\\frac{1}{3}$ of a large pizza is $\\frac{1}{3}p$, and the weight of $3 \\frac{1}{2}$ cups of orange slices is $3 \\frac{1}{2}o$. Similarly, the weight of $\\frac{3}{4}$ of a large pizza is $\\frac{3}{4}p$, and the weight of $\\frac{1}{2}$ cup of orange slices is $\\frac{1}{2}o$.\nStep 5:  The equation representing the given situation is: $\\frac{1}{3}p + 3 \\frac{1}{2}o = \\frac{3}{4}p + \\frac{1}{2}o$.\nStep 6:  We can simplify the equation by converting the mixed number $3 \\frac{1}{2}$ to an improper fraction, which is $\\frac{7}{2}$. Similarly, we can convert the mixed number $\\frac{1}{2}$ to an improper fraction, which is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\nStep 7:  Substituting the values of $o$ and the improper fractions into the equation, we get: $\\frac{1}{3}p + \\frac{7}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}p + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}$.\nStep 8:  Simplifying the equation further, we have: $\\frac{1}{3}p + \\frac{7}{8} = \\frac{3}{4}p + \\frac{1}{8}$.\nStep 9:  To isolate the variable $p$, we can first multiply the entire equation by $24$ to clear the fractions, resulting in: $8p + 21 = 18p + 3$.\nStep 10:  Next, we can subtract $8p$ from both sides of the equation to get: $21 = 10p + 3$.\nStep 11:  Then, we can subtract $3$ from both sides to obtain: $18 = 10p$.\nStep 12:  Finally, we can solve for $p$ by dividing both sides by $10$, giving us: $p = \\frac{18}{10}$.\nStep 13:  Therefore, the weight of a large pizza is $\\frac{18}{10}$ pounds.\nStep 14:  To find the final answer in the form $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers, we can simplify the fraction $\\frac{18}{10}$ by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $2$.\nStep 15:  Simplifying the fraction, we get: $\\frac{18}{10} = \\frac{9}{5}$.\nStep 16:  Therefore, the final answer is $\\frac{9}{5}$, and $m - n = 9 - 5 = 4$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$",
  "Step 1:  To find the units digit of the sum of the 2023rd row in the given triangular array, we need to first understand the pattern of the numbers in each row.\nStep 2:  Looking at the given rows, we can observe that the units digit of each number in the row is determined by the units digit of the sum of the two numbers diagonally above it in the previous row.\nStep 3:  We are given that the units digit of the sum of the two numbers diagonally above it in the previous row is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. This means that the units digit of the sum of the two numbers diagonally above it in the previous row is always even.\nStep 4:  Now, we need to find the units digit of the sum of the 2023rd row. Since the units digit of the sum of the two numbers diagonally above it in the previous row is always even, the units digit of the sum of the 2023rd row will be the same as the units digit of the sum of the two numbers diagonally above it in the previous row.\nStep 5:  Therefore, the units digit of the sum of the 2023rd row is $\\boxed{5}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the structure of a regular icosahedron and how the distances between its vertices are related.\nStep 2:  A regular icosahedron has 20 equilateral triangle faces, 30 edges, and 12 vertices. Each vertex is connected to 5 edges, and each edge connects 2 vertices.\nStep 3:  We are asked to find the probability that the distance between vertices $Q$ and $R$ is greater than the distance between vertices $R$ and $S$.\nStep 4:  To approach this, we need to consider the possible distances between vertices in the icosahedron. The distance between two vertices can be 1, 2, or 3, as these are the only possible distances in a regular icosahedron.\nStep 5:  We can use the fact that there are 12 vertices in the icosahedron and that each vertex is connected to 5 edges. This means that for any given vertex, there are 5 other vertices that are 1 edge away, 5 other vertices that are 2 edges away, and 1 vertex that is 3 edges away.\nStep 6:  We can use this information to calculate the number of ways to choose $Q$, $R$, and $S$ such that $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$.\nStep 7:  We can then use the total number of ways to choose $Q$, $R$, and $S$ to calculate the probability.\nStep 8:  By considering the different cases and using the properties of the icosahedron, we can determine the probability that $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$.\nStep 9:  Finally, we can express the probability in the form $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers, and find the sum $m+n$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{13}$",

Solving for $f(6)$, we find $f(6) = \\frac{1}{6}$.\nStep 7:  We notice a pattern emerging, where $f(n) = \\frac{1}{n}$ for all positive integers $n$.\nStep 8:  To confirm this pattern, we can substitute $f(n) = \\frac{1}{n}$ into the functional equation and verify that it holds true for all positive integers $n$.\nStep 9:  Substituting $f(n) = \\frac{1}{n}$ into the functional equation, we get $\\sum_{d\\mid n}d\\cdot \\frac{1}{\\frac{n}{d}} = \\sum_{d\\mid n}d\\cdot \\frac{d}{n} = \\sum_{d\\mid n}1 = 1$, which confirms our pattern.\nStep 10:  Therefore, we can conclude that $f(n) = \\frac{1}{n}$ for all positive integers $n$.\nStep 11:  Finally, we can use this pattern to find $f(2023)$, which is simply $\\frac{1}{2023}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2023}}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve the given equation, we first need to expand the left-hand side and then simplify it to a form that allows us to find the values of $a$ and $b$.\nStep 2:  The given equation is $(1+2a)(2+2b)(2a+b) = 32ab.$\nStep 3:  Expanding the left-hand side, we get $(2a+b)(4a+4b+2ab) = 32ab.$\nStep 4:  Simplifying this, we obtain $2a(4a+4b+2ab) + b(4a+4b+2ab) = 32ab.$\nStep 5:  Further simplifying, we get $8a^2 + 8ab + 4a^2b + 4ab + 2a^2b^2 + 2ab^2 = 32ab.$\nStep 6:  Rearranging the terms, we have $2a^2b^2 + 12a^2b + 12ab^2 + 32ab = 0.$\nStep 7:  Factoring out $4ab$ from the

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to consider the different ways in which Janet's running total can equal $3$ after rolling a standard $6$-sided die $4$ times.\nStep 2:  We'll start by considering the possible outcomes of the first roll. If the first roll is a $3$, then the running total will equal $3$ after the first roll. The probability of rolling a $3$ on a standard $6$-sided die is $\\frac{1}{6}$.\nStep 3:  Next, we'll consider the case where the first roll is a $1$ or a $2$. If the first roll is a $1$, then the running total will equal $3$ after the second roll if the second roll is a $2$. The probability of rolling a $2$ on a standard $6$-sided die is $\\frac{1}{6}$. Similarly, if the first roll is a $2$, then the running total will equal $3$ after the second roll if the second roll is a $1$. Again, the probability of rolling a $1$ on a standard $6$-sided die is $\\frac{1}{6}$.\nStep 4:  Now, we need to consider the case where the first two rolls sum to $3$. This can happen in two ways: either the first roll is a $1$ and the second roll is a $2$, or the first roll is a $2$ and the second roll is a $1$. The probability of rolling a $1$ and then a $2$ is $\\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{36}$, and the probability of rolling a $2$ and then a $1$ is also $\\frac{1}{36}$.\nStep 5:  We also need to consider the case where the first three rolls sum to $3$. This can happen in two ways: either the first roll is a $1$, the second roll is a $1$, and the third roll is a $1$, or the first roll is a $2$, the second roll is a $1$, and the third roll is a $0$. However, since a standard $6$-sided die does not have a $0$, this case is impossible.\nStep 6:  We can calculate the total probability by adding the probabilities of these cases together: $\\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{36} + \\frac{1}{36} = \\frac{6}{36} + \\frac{1}{36} + \\frac{1}{36} = \\frac{8}{36} = \\frac{2}{9}$.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the probability that at some point, her running total will equal $3$ is $\\frac{2}{9}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{11}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to start by understanding the properties of the logarithmic function and how it relates to the given information.\nStep 2:  We are given that points $A$ and $B$ lie on the graph of $y=\\log_{2}x$. This means that the coordinates of $A$ and $B$ can be represented as $(x, \\log_2 x)$ for some positive value of $x$.\nStep 3:  The midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$ is given as $(6, 2)$. Using the midpoint formula, we can express the midpoint as the average of the $x$-coordinates and the average of the $y$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$.\nStep 4:  This gives us the equation $\\left(\\frac{x_A + x_B}{2}, \\frac{\\log_2 x_A + \\log_2 x_B}{2}\\right) = (6, 2)$.\nStep 5:  From the $y$-coordinate of the midpoint, we can deduce that $\\log_2 x_A + \\log_2 x_B = 4$, which simplifies to $\\log_2 (x_A x_B) = 4$.\nStep 6:  This further simplifies to $x_A x_B = 2^4 = 16$.\nStep 7:  We also know that the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$ is $(6, 2)$, so the average of the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ is $6$. This gives us the equation $\\frac{x_A + x_B}{2} = 6$, which simplifies to $x_A + x_B = 12$.\nStep 8:  We can use the equation $x_A x_B = 16$ and $x_A + x_B = 12$ to solve for the values of $x_A$ and $x_B$.\nStep 9:  By solving the quadratic equation $x^2 - 12x + 16 = 0$, we find that the roots are $x = 2$ and $x = 8$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the positive difference between the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ is $8 - 2 = 6$.\nStep 11:  Hence, the positive difference between the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ is $\\boxed{6}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$",

The year 2023 has a fixed 4-digit year, so we only need to focus on the 2-digit month and 2-digit date.\nStep 3:  We first consider the case where the year 2023 is displayed as 2023yy, where yy represents the 2-digit month. In this case, the digits 2 and 3 will appear an odd number of times, so there are no valid dates in this case.\nStep 4:  Next, we consider the case where the year 2023 is displayed as 20yy3, where yy represents the 2-digit month. Here, the digits 2 and 3 will appear an odd number of times, so there are no valid dates in this case either.\nStep 5:  Moving on to the case where the year 2023 is displayed as 2yy03, where yy represents the 2-digit month. In this case, the digits 0 and 3 will appear an odd number of times, so there are no valid dates in this case.\nStep 6:  Finally, we consider the case where the year 2023 is displayed as 2020yy, where yy represents the 2-digit month. Here, the digits 0 and 2 will appear an odd number of times, so there are no valid dates in this case.\nStep 7:  However, we also need to consider the case where the year 2023 is displayed as 2023yy, where yy represents the 2-digit date. In this case, the digits 2 and 3 will appear an even number of times, so we need to count the number of valid dates in this case.\nStep 8:  We find that the valid dates in this case are 2023 02 28, 2023 03 02, 2023 03 32, 2023 11 20, 2023 11 21, 2023 11 22, 2023 11 23, 2023 11 24, 2023 11 25, 2023 11 26, 2023 11 27, 2023 11 28, 2023 11 29, 2023 11 30, 2023 12 02, 2023 12 12, 2023 12 22, and 2023 12 32.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the total number of valid dates in the year 2023 is $\\boxed{1}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

Therefore, the total amount of juice in the first three glasses is $3x$.\nStep 4:  Since the fourth glass is only $\\frac{1}{3}$ full, the amount of juice in it is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\nStep 5:  To make all four glasses have the same amount of juice, we need to find the amount of juice that should be poured from each of the first three glasses into the fourth glass.\nStep 6:  This can be represented by the equation $3x - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{4}{3}x$, where $3x - \\frac{1}{3}$ represents the amount of juice in the first three glasses after pouring, and $\\frac{4}{3}x$ represents the amount of juice in the fourth glass after pouring.\nStep 7:  Solving for $x$, we get $3x - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{4}{3}x$, which simplifies to $\\frac{1}{3}x = \\frac{1}{3}$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, $x = 1$, which means each of the first three glasses has 1 unit of juice.\nStep 9:  To find the fraction of a glass that Mrs. Jones must pour from each of the first three glasses into the fourth glass, we need to find the difference between the amount of juice in each of the first three glasses and the amount of juice in the fourth glass.\nStep 10:  This can be calculated as $\\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{4}{12} - \\frac{3}{12} = \\frac{1}{12}$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the fraction of a glass that Mrs. Jones must pour from each of the first three glasses into the fourth glass is $\\frac{1}{12}$.\nStep 12:  The final answer can be written in the form $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.

We're interested in finding the slope of the line passing through the points of intersection of these two circles.\nStep 3:  We can start by considering the coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. Since the circle with radius $4$ is tangent to the $y$-axis at the origin, its center lies on the positive $x$-axis. Similarly, the center of the circle with radius $10$ lies on the positive $y$-axis.\nStep 4:  Let's assume the coordinates of point $A$ as $(4a,0)$ and the coordinates of point $B$ as $(0,10b)$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive real numbers.\nStep 5:  The equation of the circle centered at $A$ is given by $(x-4a)^2+y^2=16$, and the equation of the circle centered at $B$ is given by $x^2+(y-10b)^2=100$.\nStep 6:  We're interested in finding the points of intersection of these two circles, which can be obtained by solving the system of equations formed by the circle equations.\nStep 7:  By solving the system of equations, we can find the coordinates of the points of intersection, which will allow us to determine the slope of the line passing through these points.\nStep 8:  Once we have the coordinates of the points of intersection, we can use the formula for the slope of a line passing through two points to find the required slope.\nStep 9:  After obtaining the slope, we can express it in the form $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers, and then find the sum $m+n$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{11}$",

This means the longer base has a length of $2x$.\nStep 3:  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the height of the trapezoid. The height can be calculated using the formula $\\sqrt{1^2 - \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^2}$, which simplifies to $\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{x^2}{4}}$.\nStep 4:  The area of the trapezoid can be calculated using the formula $\\frac{1}{2}h(b_1 + b_2)$, where $h$ is the height, and $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the lengths of the bases.\nStep 5:  Substituting the values, we get the area as $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{x^2}{4}} \\cdot (x + 2x) = \\frac{3x}{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{x^2}{4}}$.\nStep 6:  To find the maximum area, we need to maximize the expression $\\frac{3x}{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{x^2}{4}}$.\nStep 7:  We can simplify this expression to $\\frac{3x}{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{4-x^2}{4}} = \\frac{3x}{2} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{4-x^2}}{2} = \\frac{3x\\sqrt{4-x^2}}{4}$.\nStep 8:  To maximize this expression, we can use the AM-GM inequality, which states that the arithmetic mean of a set of non-negative numbers is greater than or equal to the geometric mean of the same set of numbers.\nStep 9:  Applying the AM-GM inequality to the expression $\\frac{4-x^2}{4}$, we get $\\frac{4-x^2}{4} \\le \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nStep 10:  This simplifies to $4 - x^2 \\le 2$, and further simplifies to $x^2 \\ge 2$.\nStep 11:  However, we also know that $x^2 \\le 4$, as the length of the shorter base cannot be greater than the length of the longer base.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the maximum value of $x^2$ is $2$, and the maximum value of $x$ is $\\sqrt{2}$.\nStep 13:  Substituting $x = \\sqrt{2}$ into the expression for the area, we get $\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{4-2}}{2} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}$.\nStep 14:  Therefore, the maximum area of the trapezoid is $\\frac{3}{2}$.\nStep 15:  The final answer is: $\\boxed{13}$",

However, we can also express $z\\otimes z$ as $z^2+40$.\nStep 9:  This means that $z^2 = a^2 + 2abi - b^2$, and we can equate the real and imaginary parts of this expression to get two equations: $a^2 - b^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 40$ and $2ab = 0$.\nStep 10:  From the second equation, we can conclude that either $a=0$ or $b=0$.\nStep 11:  If $a=0$, then the first equation becomes $-b^2 = b^2 + 40$, which simplifies to $2b^2 = -40$, and solving for $b^2$ gives us $b^2 = -20$.\nStep 12:  However, this is not possible since $b^2$ cannot be negative.\nStep 13:  Therefore, we must have $b=0$, and the first equation becomes $a^2 = a^2 + 40$, which simplifies to $0 = 40$.\nStep 14:  This is not possible, so we must have $a=0$.\nStep 15:  Now, we can find the value of $|z|^2$ by substituting $a=0$ and $b=0$ into the expression $|z|^2 = a^2 + b^2$.\nStep 16:  This gives us $|z|^2 = 0^2 + 0^2 = 0$.\nStep 17:  Therefore, the value of $|z|^2$ is $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of turns required to guarantee that at least one of the guessed squares is covered by the rectangle.\nStep 2:  We can start by considering the worst-case scenario, where the rectangle covers the two adjacent squares in a way that maximizes the number of turns needed to find a covered square.\nStep 3:  In the worst-case scenario, the rectangle covers the top-left and top-center squares of the $3 \\times 3$ grid. This means that the player needs to make a series of guesses to try to find a covered square.\nStep 4:  The first guess can be any square, and let's assume it's the top-right square. If this square is covered, then the player has found a covered square in one turn. However, if this square is not covered, then the player needs to make additional guesses.\nStep 5:  In the case where the top-right square is not covered, the player needs to make two more guesses to find a covered square. This is because the rectangle must cover either the top-left or top-center square, and the player needs to try both of these squares to find a covered one.\nStep 6:  Therefore, in the worst-case scenario, the player needs a maximum of $3$ turns to find a covered square.\nStep 7:  This is the minimum number of turns required to ensure that at least one of the guessed squares is covered by the rectangle.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the values of $n$ for which the given expression represents a real number.\nStep 2:  The expression involves logarithms and square roots, so we need to carefully analyze the conditions under which the expression is defined and when it yields a real value.\nStep 3:  We start by considering the denominator of the expression, which is $\\log n - 3.$ For the expression to be defined, the denominator must be nonzero, so we have the condition $\\log n - 3 \\neq 0.$ This simplifies to $\\log n \\neq 3,$ which further translates to $n \\neq 10^3 = 1000.$\nStep 4:  Next, we consider the numerator of the expression, which is $\\log (n^2) - (\\log n)^2.$ We can simplify this using the properties of logarithms to get $2 \\log n - (\\log n)^2.$\nStep 5:  To ensure that the expression under the square root is nonnegative, we need to satisfy the inequality $2 \\log n - (\\log n)^2 \\ge 0.$ This can be rewritten as $(\\log n)^2 - 2 \\log n \\le 0.$\nStep 6:  Factoring the quadratic inequality, we get $\\log n (\\log n - 2) \\le 0.$ This inequality holds true when $0 < \\log n \\le 2.$\nStep 7:  Converting the inequality to exponential form, we get $1 \\le n \\le 100.$\nStep 8:  Therefore, the expression represents a real number for $n$ in the range $1 \\le n \\le 100.$\nStep 9:  However, we also need to consider the restriction that $n \\neq 1000.$\nStep 10:  Combining these conditions, we find that the expression represents a real number for $n$ in the range $1 \\le n \\le 1000$ excluding $n = 1000.$\nStep 11:  Therefore, the number of integers $n$ for which the expression represents a real number is $1000 - 1 = 999.$\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{999}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the given inequality and how it defines a region in the coordinate plane.\nStep 2:  The inequality $| | x | - 1 | + | | y | - 1 | \\le 1$ involves absolute values, which means the expression inside the absolute value can be either positive or negative.\nStep 3:  We can start by considering the cases when $x \\ge 0$ and $y \\ge 0$, which simplifies the inequality to $|x - 1| + |y - 1| \\le 1$.\nStep 4:  This inequality defines a region in the first quadrant of the coordinate plane. We can further break it down into cases based on the values of $x$ and $y$ to understand the boundaries of this region.\nStep 5:  When $x \\ge 1$ and $y \\ge 1$, the inequality becomes $x - 1 + y - 1 \\le 1$, which simplifies to $x + y \\le 3$. This defines a triangle in the first quadrant with vertices at $(0,0)$, $(3,0)$, and $(0,3)$.\nStep 6:  However, we need to consider the other cases as well, such as when $x < 1$ and $y < 1$, to ensure we capture the entire region defined by the inequality.\nStep 7:  By analyzing all the cases, we find that the region defined by the inequality is a square with side length 2, centered at the origin.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the area of this region is the area of a square with side length 2, which is $2^2 = 4$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$"
