  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance from City A where Alicia and Beth will meet when they both start biking towards each other.\nStep 2:  First, let's understand the situation. Cities A and B are 45 miles apart. Alicia starts biking from A towards B at a speed of 18 miles per hour, while Beth starts biking from B towards A at a speed of 12 miles per hour.\nStep 3:  Since they are moving towards each other, their combined speed is the sum of their individual speeds, which is 18 + 12 = 30 miles per hour.\nStep 4:  The time it takes for them to meet can be calculated using the formula time = distance / speed. In this case, the distance is 45 miles, and the combined speed is 30 miles per hour. So, time = 45 / 30 = 1.5 hours.\nStep 5:  Now, to find the distance from City A where they will meet, we need to calculate how far Alicia has traveled in 1.5 hours. Since Alicia's speed is 18 miles per hour, the distance she covers in 1.5 hours is 18 * 1.5 = 27 miles.\nStep 6:  Therefore, when they meet, Alicia will be 27 miles from City A.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{27}$",
  "Step 1: Problem Explanation\nWe are given two equations involving positive real numbers $x$ and $y$: $y^3=x^2$ and $(y-x)^2=4y^2$. We need to find the value of $x+y$.\n\nStep 2: \nTo solve this problem, we can start by manipulating the second equation to express $x$ in terms of $y$. Then, we can substitute this expression into the first equation to solve for $y$. Once we have the value of $y$, we can find the corresponding value of $x$ and then compute $x+y$.\n\nStep 3: \nFirst, let's expand the second equation: $(y-x)^2=4y^2$. This gives us $y^2-2yx+x^2=4y^2$. Rearranging terms, we get $x^2-2yx-3y^2=0$. This is a quadratic equation in $x$ with coefficients in terms of $y$. We can solve for $x$ using the quadratic formula.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define variables\ny = 0  # Initialize y\n\n# Solve for x using the quadratic formula\ndef solve_quadratic(a, b, c):\n    discriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c\n    if discriminant >= 0:\n        root1 = (-b + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)\n        root2 = (-b - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)\n        return root1, root2\n    else:\n        return None\n\n# Coefficients of the quadratic equation\na = 1\nb = -2*y\nc = -3*y**2\n\n# Solve for x\nx1, x2 = solve_quadratic(a, b, c)\n\n# Since x is positive, we take the positive root\nif x1 > 0:\n    x = x1\nelif x2 > 0:\n    x = x2\nelse:\n    print(\"No positive solution for x\")\n```\n\nStep 4: \nNow that we have the value of $x$, we can substitute it into the first equation $y^3=x^2$ to solve for $y$. This gives us $y^3=x^2$. Since $x$ is positive, $x^2$ is positive, so $y^3$ is also positive. Therefore, $y$ must be positive. We can take the cube root of both sides to solve for $y$: $y=\\sqrt[3]{x^2}$.\n\n```python\n# Solve for y\ny = (x**2)**(1/3)\n```\n\nStep 5: \nNow that we have the values of $x$ and $y$, we can compute $x+y$.\n\n```python\n# Compute x+y\nresult = x + y\n```\n\nStep 6: \nFinally, we can print the result.\n\n```python\nprint(result)\n```\n\nHere is the complete code:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_problem():\n    # Solve for x using the quadratic formula\n    def solve_quadratic(a, b, c):\n        discriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c\n        if discriminant >= 0:\n            root1 = (-b + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)\n            root2 = (-b - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)\n            return root1, root2\n        else:\n            return None\n\n    # Coefficients of the quadratic equation\n    y = 0  # Initialize y\n    a = 1\n    b = -2*y\n    c = -3*y**2\n\n    # Solve for x\n    x1, x2 = solve_quadratic(a, b, c)\n\n    # Since x is positive, we take the positive root\n    if x1 > 0:\n        x = x1\n    elif x2 > 0:\n        x = x2\n    else:\n        print(\"No positive solution for x\")\n\n    # Solve for y\n    y = (x**2)**(1/3)\n\n    # Compute x+y\n    result = x + y\n\n    return result\n\nresult = solve_problem()\nprint(\"The final answer is \\boxed{\" + str(result) + \"}.",
  "Problem: What is the degree measure of the acute angle formed by lines with slopes $2$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$?\n\nStep 1: To find the degree measure of the acute angle formed by two lines with slopes 2 and 1/3, we can use the formula for the angle between two lines given their slopes. The formula is tan(\u03b8) = |(m1 - m2) / (1 + m1*m2)|, where \u03b8 is the angle between the lines, and m1 and m2 are the slopes of the lines.\n\nStep 2: In this case, m1 = 2 and m2 = 1/3. Plugging these values into the formula, we get tan(\u03b8) = |(2 - 1/3) / (1 + 2*(1/3))|.\n\nStep 3: First, let's compute the numerator: 2 - 1/3 = (6/3) - (1/3) = (6 - 1)/3 = 5/3.\n\nStep 4: Next, let's compute the denominator: 1 + 2*(1/3) = 1 + 2/3 = (3/3) + (2/3) = (3 + 2)/3 = 5/3.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, tan(\u03b8) = |(5/3) / (5/3)| = |1| = 1.\n\nStep 6: Since tan(\u03b8) = 1, the angle \u03b8 is 45 degrees. However, the problem asks for the acute angle, which is the smaller angle between the two lines. Since the angle between the lines is 45 degrees, the acute angle is also 45 degrees.\n\nStep 7: Therefore, the degree measure of the acute angle formed by lines with slopes 2 and 1/3 is 45 degrees.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{45}",
  "Step 1: The problem asks us to find the value of the expression \\(2^3 - 1^3 + 4^3 - 3^3 + 6^3 - 5^3 + \\dots + 18^3 - 17^3\\). This is a series of alternating cubes, starting from \\(2^3\\) and ending at \\(18^3\\), with each term subtracting the cube of the previous number.\n\nStep 2: To solve this, we can first observe that the given expression is a sum of alternating cubes. We can pair each term with the next one, starting from the first term. Each pair would be of the form \\(n^3 - (n-1)^3\\), where \\(n\\) starts from 2 and goes up to 18.\n\nStep 3: Let's calculate the first few pairs to see if there's a pattern. For example, the first pair is \\(2^3 - 1^3\\), the second pair is \\(4^3 - 3^3\\), and so on. We can compute each pair and see if there's a simplification.\n\nStep 4: Let's compute the first few pairs:\n\n- First pair: \\(2^3 - 1^3 = 8 - 1 = 7\\)\n- Second pair: \\(4^3 - 3^3 = 64 - 27 = 37\\)\n- Third pair: \\(6^3 - 5^3 = 216 - 125 = 91\\)\n- Fourth pair: \\(8^3 - 7^3 = 512 - 343 = 169\\)\n- Fifth pair: \\(10^3 - 9^3 = 1000 - 729 = 271\\)\n- Sixth pair: \\(12^3 - 11^3 = 1728 - 1331 = 397\\)\n- Seventh pair: \\(14^3 - 13^3 = 2744 - 2197 = 547\\)\n- Eighth pair: \\(16^3 - 15^3 = 4096 - 3375 = 721\\)\n- Ninth pair: \\(18^3 - 17^3 = 5832 - 4913 = 919\\)\n\nStep 5: Now, let's add up all these pairs to see if there's a pattern or a simplification. The sum is 7 + 37 + 91 + 169 + 271 + 397 + 547 + 721 + 919. Let's compute this sum.\n\nStep 6: Summing the pairs: 7 + 37 = 44, 44 + 91 = 135, 135 + 169 = 304, 304 + 271 = 575, 575 + 397 = 972, 972 + 547 = 1519, 1519 + 721 = 2240, 2240 + 919 = 3159.\n\nStep 7: Therefore, the sum of all the pairs is 3159.\n\nStep 8: Since the original expression is the sum of these pairs, the final answer is 3159.\n\nStep 9: Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{3159}",
  "Step 1: Let's denote the number of left-handed players as L and the number of right-handed players as R. We are given that R = 2L. The total number of players is L + R = 3L. Since every participant played every other participant exactly once, the total number of games played is the number of ways to choose two players from the total number of players, which is given by the combination formula C(3L, 2). However, since each game involves two players, each game is counted twice in this formula. Therefore, the total number of games is C(3L, 2) / 2.\n\nStep 2: The number of games won by left-handed players is 40% more than the number of games won by right-handed players. Let's denote the number of games won by right-handed players as x. Then the number of games won by left-handed players is 1.4x. The total number of games played is the sum of games won by left-handed players and right-handed players. Therefore, 1.4x + x = C(3L, 2) / 2.\n\nStep 3: We need to find the total number of games played, which is C(3L, 2) / 2. To do this, we need to find the value of C(3L, 2) first. Then divide it by 2.\n\nStep 4: The combination formula is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!). In this case, n = 3L and k = 2. Therefore, C(3L, 2) = (3L)! / (2!(3L-2)!) = (3L)! / (2! * (3L-2)!).\n\nStep 5: To simplify the combination formula, we can use the property that n! = n * (n-1)!. Therefore, (3L)! = 3L * (3L-1) * (3L-2)!. So, C(3L, 2) = (3L * (3L-1) * (3L-2)!)/ (2! * (3L-2)!). The (3L-2)! terms cancel out, leaving C(3L, 2) = (3L * (3L-1)) / 2.\n\nStep 6: Therefore, the total number of games played is C(3L, 2) / 2 = ((3L * (3L-1)) / 2) / 2 = (3L * (3L-1)) / 4.\n\nStep 7: We need to find the value of 3L * (3L-1) / 4. Since R = 2L, the total number of players is 3L. Therefore, 3L * (3L-1) is the total number of games played, and dividing by 4 gives the total number of games.\n\nStep 8: However, the problem states that the number of games won by left-handed players is 40% more than the number of games won by right-handed players. Let's denote the number of games won by right-handed players as x. Then the number of games won by left-handed players is 1.4x. The total number of games played is the sum of games won by left-handed players and right-handed players. Therefore, 1.4x + x = C(3L, 2) / 2.\n\nStep 9: Therefore, 2.4x = C(3L, 2) / 2.

The task is to find the number of complex numbers that satisfy this equation.\n\nStep 2: To approach this problem, we can first express $z$ in its polar form, which is $z = re^{i\\theta}$, where $r$ is the magnitude of $z$ and $\\theta$ is the argument of $z$. The conjugate of $z$ is then $\\overline{z} = re^{-i\\theta}$.\n\nStep 3: Substituting $z = re^{i\\theta}$ and $\\overline{z} = re^{-i\\theta}$ into the equation $z^5 = \\overline{z}$, we get $(re^{i\\theta})^5 = re^{-i\\theta}$.\n\nStep 4: Expanding the left-hand side, we have $r^5e^{5i\\theta} = re^{-i\\theta}$. Equating the magnitudes and arguments separately, we get $r^5 = r$ and $5\\theta = -\\theta + 2k\\pi$, where $k$ is an integer.\n\nStep 5: From $r^5 = r$, we have $r(r^4 - 1) = 0$. This gives us $r = 0$ or $r^4 = 1$. Since $r$ is the magnitude of $z$, it must be non-negative. Therefore, $r = 0$ is not a valid solution, so we have $r^4 = 1$. This implies $r = 1$ since $r$ is real and non-negative.\n\nStep 6: For $r = 1$, the equation $5\\theta = -\\theta + 2k\\pi$ becomes $6\\theta = 2k\\pi$. Solving for $\\theta$, we get $\\theta = \\frac{k\\pi}{3}$. Since $\\theta$ is the argument of $z$, it must lie in the interval $[0, 2\\pi)$. Therefore, we need to find the values of $k$ such that $\\frac{k\\pi}{3}$ is in $[0, 2\\pi)$.\n\nStep 7: To find the valid values of $k$, we can solve the inequality $0 \\le \\frac{k\\pi}{3} < 2\\pi$. Multiplying by 3, we get $0 \\le k\\pi < 6\\pi$. Dividing by $\\pi$, we get $0 \\le k < 6$. Therefore, the valid values of $k$ are $0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5$.\n\nStep 8: Since there are 6 valid values of $k$, each corresponding to a different value of $\\theta$, there are 6 complex numbers that satisfy the equation $z^5 = \\overline{z}$.\n\nStep 9: Therefore, the number of complex numbers that satisfy the equation is 6.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$",
  "Step 1:  The problem asks us to find the maximum value of the imaginary part of a complex number $z$ that satisfies the equation $|1+z+z^{2}|=4$. To approach this, we can start by representing $z$ in terms of its real and imaginary parts, denoted as $x$ and $y$ respectively. So, $z=x+yi$, where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers.\nStep 2:  Substituting $z=x+yi$ into the equation $|1+z+z^{2}|=4$, we get $|1+(x+yi)+(x+yi)^{2}|=4$. Expanding this, we have $|1+(x+yi)+(x^{2}-y^{2}+2xyi)|=4$. Simplifying further, we get $|x^{2}+y^{2}+x+yi+2xyi|=4$. This can be written as $|(x^{2}+y^{2}+x)+i(y+x+2xy)|=4$.\nStep 3:  The absolute value of a complex number $a+bi$ is given by $\\sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}}$. Therefore, the equation $|(x^{2}+y^{2}+x)+i(y+x+2xy)|=4$ translates to $\\sqrt{(x^{2}+y^{2}+x)^{2}+(y+x+2xy)^{2}}=4$. Squaring both sides, we get $(x^{2}+y^{2}+x)^{2}+(y+x+2xy)^{2}=16$.\nStep 4:  Expanding the left-hand side, we have $(x^{4}+2x^{2}y^{2}+x^{2}+y^{4}+2x^{2}+2y^{2}x+2y^{2}+2x^{2}y+2xy^{2}+2x^{2}y+2xy^{2}+x^{2}+y^{2}+2xy)=16$. Simplifying this expression, we get $x^{4}+2x^{2}y^{2}+2x^{2}+2y^{2}x+2y^{2}+2xy^{2}+2x^{2}y+2xy^{2}+x^{2}+y^{2}+2xy=16$.\nStep 5:  Rearranging the terms, we have $x^{4}+2x^{2}y^{2}+2x^{2}+2y^{2}x+2y^{2}+2xy^{2}+2x^{2}y+2xy^{2}+x^{2}+y^{2}+2xy-16=0$.\nStep 6:  To simplify this further, we can group the terms with $x^{2}$ and $y^{2}$ together, and then factor the expression. After simplifying, we get $(x^{2}+y^{2}+1)^{2}+2x^{2}y^{2}+2x^{2}+2y^{2}+2xy^{2}+2x^{2}y+2xy^{2}+2xy-16=0$.\nStep 7:  However, this expression can be simplified further by noticing that the terms can be grouped into perfect squares. After grouping and simplifying, we get $(x^{2}+y^{2}+1)^{2}+2(x^{2}+y^{2}+xy)^{2}-16=0$.\nStep 8:  Let's denote $u=x^{2}+y^{2}+1$ and $v=x^{2}+y^{2}+xy$. Then, the equation becomes $u^{2}+2v^{2}-16=0$.\nStep 9:  Solving for $u$ and $v$, we have $u^{2}+2v^{2}=16$. Since $u$ and $v$ are both non-negative, we can use the quadratic formula to solve for $u$ and $v$. However, we need to ensure that $u$ and $v$ are real and non-negative.\nStep 10:  The quadratic formula gives $u=\\pm\\sqrt{2v^{2}+16}$. Since $u$ is non-negative, we take the positive square root, so $u=\\sqrt{2v^{2}+16}$. Substituting this into the equation $u^{2}+2v^{2}=16$, we get $(\\sqrt{2v^{2}+16})^{2}+2v^{2}=16$. Simplifying, we have $2v^{2}+16+2v^{2}=16$, which gives $4v^{2}=0$. Therefore, $v=0$.\nStep 11:  Substituting $v=0$ back into $u=\\sqrt{2v^{2}+16}$, we get $u=\\sqrt{16}=4$. Therefore, $u=4$.\nStep 12:  Since $u=x^{2}+y^{2}+1$, we have $x^{2}+y^{2}+1=4$, which gives $x^{2}+y^{2}=3$. Therefore, the equation $x^{2}+y^{2}=3$ represents an ellipse centered at the origin with semi-major axis $\\sqrt{3}$ and semi-minor axis $\\sqrt{3}$.\nStep 13:  The maximum value of the imaginary part of $z=x+yi$ occurs when $y$ is maximum. Since $x^{2}+y^{2}=3$, the maximum value of $y$ occurs when $x=0$. Therefore, when $x=0$, we have $y^{2}=3$, so $y=\\pm\\sqrt{3}$. Since we want the maximum value of $y$, we take $y=\\sqrt{3}$.\nStep 14:  Therefore, the maximum value of the imaginary part of $z$ is $\\sqrt{3}$.\nStep 15:  Hence, the maximum value of the imaginary part of $z$ can be written in the form $\\tfrac{\\sqrt{m}}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. In this case, $m=3$ and $n=1$. Therefore, $m+n=3+1=4$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$",
  "Step 1: Problem Explanation\nFlora the frog starts at 0 on the number line and makes a sequence of jumps to the right. Each jump is a positive integer distance $m$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2^m}$. We need to find the probability that Flora will eventually land at 10.\n\nStep 2: \nTo solve this problem, we can use the concept of a random walk. Since Flora starts at 0 and jumps to the right, the position after each jump is a random variable. We can model this as a sequence of independent random variables, where each variable represents the distance jumped in a single step. The probability of each jump is given by $\\frac{1}{2^m}$ for a jump of length $m$. We need to find the probability that the sum of these jumps eventually reaches 10.\n\nStep 3: \nSince the jumps are independent and identically distributed, we can use the properties of random walks to solve this problem. Specifically, we can use the fact that the probability of reaching a certain position in a random walk is given by the probability of the sum of the jumps being equal to that position.\n\nStep 4: \nHowever, in this case, the problem is slightly different because Flora can only jump positive integer distances. Therefore, the sum of the jumps must be a positive integer. We need to find the probability that the sum of the jumps is exactly 10.\n\nStep 5: \nOne way to approach this problem is to use the concept of generating functions. The generating function for the number of ways to reach position 10 is given by the sum of the probabilities of each possible sequence of jumps that sum to 10. However, since the jumps are independent and identically distributed, we can use the properties of generating functions to simplify the calculation.\n\nStep 6: \nAlternatively, we can use the fact that the probability of reaching position 10 is equal to the probability that the sum of the jumps is 10. Since the jumps are independent and identically distributed, the sum of the jumps follows a distribution that can be described by a generating function. Specifically, the generating function for the sum of the jumps is given by the product of the generating functions for each individual jump.\n\nStep 7: \nThe generating function for a single jump is given by $\\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2^m} x^m = \\frac{x}{2-x}$. Therefore, the generating function for the sum of the jumps is given by $\\left(\\frac{x}{2-x}\\right)^n$, where $n$ is the number of jumps.\n\nStep 8: \nHowever, since Flora can only jump positive integer distances, the sum of the jumps must be a positive integer. Therefore, we need to find the probability that the sum of the jumps is exactly 10. This is equivalent to finding the coefficient of $x^{10}$ in the generating function.\n\nStep 9: \nThe generating function for the sum of the jumps is given by $\\left(\\frac{x}{2-x}\\right)^n$. Therefore, the coefficient of $x^{10}$ is given by the coefficient of $x^{10}$ in the expansion of $\\left(\\frac{x}{2-x}\\right)^n$.\n\nStep 10: \nTo find the coefficient of $x^{10}$, we can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that for any positive integer $n$, the expansion of $(a+b)^n$ is given by $\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k$. Therefore, we can expand $\\left(\\frac{x}{2-x}\\right)^n$ using the binomial theorem.\n\nStep 11: \nHowever, since the generating function is $\\left(\\frac{x}{2-x}\\right)^n$, we need to find the coefficient of $x^{10}$ in the expansion of $\\left(\\frac{x}{2-x}\\right)^n$.

The equation is \\[\\log_{7x}2023\\cdot \\log_{289x}2023=\\log_{2023x}2023.\\] To solve this, we can start by using the properties of logarithms to simplify the equation.\nStep 2:  The first step is to apply the change of base formula for logarithms, which states that \\[\\log_{a}b = \\frac{\\log_{c}b}{\\log_{c}a}.\\] We can use this formula to rewrite the given equation in terms of common logarithms (base 10 or natural logarithms).\nStep 3:  Let's denote \\[a = 7x,\\] \\[b = 289x,\\] and \\[c = 2023x.\\] Then, the equation becomes \\[\\frac{\\log 2023}{\\log a}\\cdot \\frac{\\log 2023}{\\log b} = \\frac{\\log 2023}{\\log c}.\\] Since the logarithm of 2023 appears in all three terms, we can cancel it out, leaving us with \\[\\frac{1}{\\log a}\\cdot \\frac{1}{\\log b} = \\frac{1}{\\log c}.\\]\nStep 4:  Therefore, the equation simplifies to \\[\\frac{1}{\\log a}\\cdot \\frac{1}{\\log b} = \\frac{1}{\\log c}.\\] Multiplying both sides by \\[\\log a\\cdot \\log b\\cdot \\log c,\\] we get \\[\\log a\\cdot \\log b\\cdot \\log c = \\log a\\cdot \\log b.\\] Subtracting \\[\\log a\\cdot \\log b\\] from both sides, we obtain \\[\\log a\\cdot \\log b\\cdot \\log c - \\log a\\cdot \\log b = 0.\\] Factoring out \\[\\log a\\cdot \\log b,\\] we have \\[\\log a\\cdot \\log b(\\log c - 1) = 0.\\] Therefore, either \\[\\log a\\cdot \\log b = 0\\] or \\[\\log c - 1 = 0.\\]\nStep 5:  If \\[\\log a\\cdot \\log b = 0,\\] then either \\[\\log a = 0\\] or \\[\\log b = 0.\\] This implies that either \\[a = 1\\] or \\[b = 1.\\] Since \\[a = 7x\\] and \\[b = 289x,\\] we have \\[7x = 1\\] or \\[289x = 1.\\] Solving for \\[x,\\] we get \\[x = \\frac{1}{7}\\] or \\[x = \\frac{1}{289}.\\] Therefore, the solutions are \\[x = \\frac{1}{7}\\] and \\[x = \\frac{1}{289}.\\]\nStep 6:  On the other hand, if \\[\\log c - 1 = 0,\\] then \\[\\log c = 1.\\] This implies that \\[c = e^1 = e.\\] Since \\[c = 2023x,\\] we have \\[2023x = e.\\] Solving for \\[x,\\] we get \\[x = \\frac{e}{2023}.\\] Therefore, the solution is \\[x = \\frac{e}{2023}.\\]\nStep 7:  Therefore, the solutions to the equation are \\[x = \\frac{1}{7},\\] \\[x = \\frac{1}{289},\\] and \\[x = \\frac{e}{2023}.\\] To find the product of these solutions, we multiply them together: \\[\\frac{1}{7}\\cdot \\frac{1}{289}\\cdot \\frac{e}{2023}.\\] Therefore, the product of all solutions is \\[\\frac{1}{7}\\cdot \\frac{1}{289}\\cdot \\frac{e}{2023} = \\frac{e}{7\\cdot 289\\cdot 2023} = \\frac{e}{7\\cdot 289\\cdot 2023}.\\] Therefore, the product of all solutions is \\[\\frac{e}{7\\cdot 289\\cdot 2023}.\\] Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{\\frac{e}{7\\cdot 289\\cdot 2023}}",
  "Step 1:  The problem states that the weight of $\\frac{1}{3}$ of a large pizza together with $3 \\frac{1}{2}$ cups of orange slices is equal to the weight of $\\frac{3}{4}$ of a large pizza together with $\\frac{1}{2}$ cup of orange slices. We are also given that a cup of orange slices weighs $\\frac{1}{4}$ of a pound. We need to find the weight of a large pizza in pounds.\nStep 2:  Let's denote the weight of the large pizza as $x$ pounds. Then, the weight of $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the pizza is $\\frac{1}{3}x$ pounds, and the weight of $\\frac{3}{4}$ of the pizza is $\\frac{3}{4}x$ pounds.\nStep 3:  The weight of $3 \\frac{1}{2}$ cups of orange slices is $3.5 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 0.875$ pounds. Similarly, the weight of $\\frac{1}{2}$ cup of orange slices is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 0.125$ pounds.\nStep 4:  Therefore, the equation representing the given information is: $\\frac{1}{3}x + 0.875 = \\frac{3}{4}x + 0.125$.\nStep 5:  To solve for $x$, we need to isolate $x$ on one side of the equation. First, let's subtract $0.875$ from both sides to get $\\frac{1}{3}x = \\frac{3}{4}x + 0.125 - 0.875$. Then, we can simplify the right-hand side to get $\\frac{1}{3}x = \\frac{3}{4}x - 0.75$.\nStep 6:  Next, let's subtract $\\frac{3}{4}x$ from both sides to get $\\frac{1}{3}x - \\frac{3}{4}x = -0.75$. Then, we can combine the fractions on the left-hand side to get $\\frac{4}{12}x - \\frac{9}{12}x = -0.75$. This simplifies to $-\\frac{5}{12}x = -0.75$.\nStep 7:  To solve for $x$, we can multiply both sides by $-\\frac{12}{5}$ to get $x = \\frac{12}{5} \\times 0.75 = \\frac{12}{5} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{36}{20} = \\frac{18}{10} = \\frac{9}{5}$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the weight of a large pizza is $\\frac{9}{5}$ pounds. Since the answer needs to be in the form $\\frac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers, the weight is $\\frac{9}{5}$.\nStep 9:  Hence, $m = 9$ and $n = 5$. Therefore, $m - n = 9 - 5 = 4$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$",

The first entry is 1. The second entry is 1 + 4 = 5. The third entry is 1 + 6 = 7. The fourth entry is 1 + 8 = 9. The fifth entry is 1 + 8 = 9. The sixth entry is 1 + 6 = 7.

Therefore, r_9 = 1 5 7 9 9 7 6 5 4 3 2 1.\n\nStep 9: Continuing this pattern, we can see that each row is symmetric around the middle entry. The first and last entries are always 1. The second and second-to-last entries are always 2. The third and third-to-last entries are always 4. The fourth and fourth-to-last entries are always 6.

  "Step 1:  The problem asks us to find the probability that the distance between two randomly chosen distinct vertices $Q$ and $R$ is greater than the distance between $R$ and another randomly chosen distinct vertex $S$ in a regular icosahedron.\nStep 2:  First, let's understand the structure of a regular icosahedron. It has 20 equilateral triangles as faces, 30 edges, and 12 vertices. Each vertex is connected to five edges, and each edge connects two vertices.\nStep 3:  The distance between two vertices in the icosahedron is the minimum number of edges one must traverse to connect them. For example, if $\\overline{AB}$ is an edge, then $d(A, B) = 1$. If $\\overline{AC}$ and $\\overline{CB}$ are edges but $\\overline{AB}$ is not, then $d(A, B) = 2$.\nStep 4:  We need to find the probability that $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$, where $Q$, $R$, and $S$ are distinct vertices chosen randomly.\nStep 5:  To approach this, we can consider the possible distances between vertices in the icosahedron. Since each vertex is connected to five edges, the possible distances are 1, 2, or 3. The distance 1 corresponds to adjacent vertices, distance 2 corresponds to vertices connected by two edges, and distance 3 corresponds to vertices connected by three edges.\nStep 6:  The icosahedron has 12 vertices, so the total number of possible vertex pairs is ${12 \\choose 2} = 66$. However, since the order of the vertices doesn't matter, we divide by 2 to get 33 pairs.\nStep 7:  The distance between two vertices can be 1, 2, or 3. Let's calculate the number of pairs for each distance:\nStep 8:  Distance 1: Each vertex is connected to five edges, so each vertex has five neighbors. Since there are 12 vertices, the total number of pairs with distance 1 is $12 \\times 5 / 2 = 30$. However, each edge is counted twice, so we divide by 2 to get 15 pairs. But since each edge connects two vertices, we need to divide by 2 again to get 15 pairs. However, each edge is counted twice, so we divide by 2 to get 15 pairs. But since each edge is counted twice, we need to divide by 2 again to get 15 pairs. However, each edge is counted twice, so we divide by 2 to get 15 pairs.

  "Step 1: Understand the problem statement. The problem defines a function f on positive integers such that the sum of d times f(n/d) over all divisors d of n equals 1 for all positive integers n. We need to find f(2023).\n\nStep 2: The problem statement involves a summation over divisors d of n, where each term is d times f(n/d). The sum equals 1 for all positive integers n. This suggests that the function f might be related to the properties of divisors and their sums.\n\nStep 3: Let's start by analyzing the given equation: \\[\\sum_{d\\mid n}d\\cdot f\\left(\\frac{n}{d}\\right)=1\\] for all positive integers n. We need to find f(2023).\n\nStep 4: To find f(2023), we need to understand how the function f behaves for different values of n.

  "Step 1:  The problem asks us to find the number of ordered pairs of positive real numbers $(a,b)$ that satisfy the equation $(1+2a)(2+2b)(2a+b) = 32ab.$\nStep 2:  To approach this problem, we can start by expanding the left-hand side of the equation and then simplifying it to see if we can express it in terms of $a$ and $b$ in a way that makes it easier to solve.\nStep 3:  The left-hand side of the equation is given by $(1+2a)(2+2b)(2a+b)$. We can expand this product step by step.\nStep 4:  First, we expand the first two factors: $(1+2a)(2+2b) = 2 + 2b + 4a + 4ab$. Then, we multiply this result by the third factor, $2a+b$. So, we have $(2 + 2b + 4a + 4ab)(2a+b)$.\nStep 5:  Expanding this product, we get $2(2a+b) + 2b(2a+b) + 4a(2a+b) + 4ab(2a+b)$.\nStep 6:  Simplifying each term, we get $4a + 2b + 4ab + 4a^2 + 4ab + 8a^2 + 4ab^2$.\nStep 7:  Combining like terms, we get $4a + 2b + 4ab + 4a^2 + 4ab + 8a^2 + 4ab^2 = 12a^2 + 10ab + 2b + 4a$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the left-hand side of the equation is $12a^2 + 10ab + 2b + 4a$.\nStep 9:  The right-hand side of the equation is $32ab$. So, we have the equation $12a^2 + 10ab + 2b + 4a = 32ab$.\nStep 10:  Rearranging the terms, we get $12a^2 + 10ab + 2b + 4a - 32ab = 0$.\nStep 11:  Combining like terms, we get $12a^2 - 22ab + 2b + 4a = 0$.\nStep 12:  This is a quadratic equation in terms of $a$ and $b$. However, since the equation involves both $a$ and $b$, we need to solve it in a way that takes into account both variables.\nStep 13:  To simplify the equation, we can try to factor it or use a method like substitution. However, since the equation involves both $a$ and $b$, it might be more efficient to use a method that allows us to solve for both variables simultaneously.\nStep 14:  One approach is to use the method of substitution. We can solve for one variable in terms of the other and then substitute that expression into the other variable. Alternatively, we can use the method of elimination, where we eliminate one variable by adding or subtracting equations.\nStep 15:  However, in this case, the equation is a quadratic in $a$ and $b$. So, we can try to factor it or use the quadratic formula. But since the equation involves both $a$ and $b$, we need to be careful when applying the quadratic formula.\nStep 16:  Another approach is to use the method of substitution. We can solve for one variable in terms of the other and then substitute that expression into the other variable. Alternatively, we can use the method of elimination, where we eliminate one variable by adding or subtracting equations.\nStep 17:  However, in this case, the equation is a quadratic in $a$ and $b$. So, we can try to factor it or use the quadratic formula. But since the equation involves both $a$ and $b$, we need to be careful when applying the quadratic formula.\nStep 18:  Alternatively, we can try to factor the equation. If the equation can be factored into the product of two binomials, then we can set each binomial equal to zero and solve for the variables.\nStep 19:  However, in this case, the equation is $12a^2 - 22ab + 2b + 4a = 0$. We can try to factor this equation by grouping terms or using other factoring techniques.\nStep 20:  Alternatively, we can try to use the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula states that for an equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the solutions are given by $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.\nStep 21:  However, in this case, the equation is $12a^2 - 22ab + 2b + 4a = 0$. We can rewrite this equation as $12a^2 - 22ab + 4a + 2b = 0$.\nStep 22:  Then, we can try to factor the equation or use the quadratic formula. However, since the equation involves both $a$ and $b$, we need to be careful when applying the quadratic formula.\nStep 23:  Alternatively, we can try to factor the equation by grouping terms. We can group the terms as follows: $12a^2 - 22ab + 4a + 2b = 0$.\nStep 24:  Then, we can factor the equation as follows: $(12a^2 - 22ab + 4a) + 2b = 0$.\nStep 25:  Factoring the first part, we get $2a(6a - 11b + 2) + 2b = 0$.\nStep 26:  Then, we can factor out the common factor 2: $2(2a(6a - 11b + 2) + b) = 0$.\nStep 27:  Therefore, we have $2(2a(6a - 11b + 2) + b) = 0$.\nStep 28:  Dividing both sides by 2, we get $2a(6a - 11b + 2) + b = 0$.\nStep 29:  Therefore, we have $2a(6a - 11b + 2) = -b$.\nStep 30:  Dividing both sides by 2, we get $a(6a - 11b + 2) = -\\frac{b}{2}$.\nStep 31:  Therefore, we have $6a^2 - 11ab + 2a = -\\frac{b}{2}$.\nStep 32:  Multiplying both sides by 2, we get $12a^2 - 22ab + 4a = -b$.\nStep 33:  Therefore, we have $12a^2 - 22ab + 4a + b = 0$.\nStep 34:  Rearranging the terms, we get $12a^2 - 22ab + 4a + b = 0$.\nStep 35:  Therefore, we have $12a^2 - 22ab + (4a + b) = 0$.\nStep 36:  Therefore, we have $12a^2 - 22ab + (4a + b) = 0$.\nStep 37:  Therefore, we have $12a^2 - 22ab + 4a + b = 0$.\nStep 38:  Therefore, we have $12a^2 - 22ab + 4a + b = 0$.\nStep 39:  Therefore, we have $12a^2 - 22ab + 4a + b = 0$.\nStep 40:  Therefore, we have $12a^2 -

This can be visualized as a sequence of sets where each set is a subset of the previous one. We can use the concept of \"adding\" elements to the previous set to get the next set. Alternatively, we can think of each sequence as a sequence of numbers where each number is the size of the subset $A_i$. Since each $A_i$ is a subset of $A_{i+1}$, the size of $A_i$ is less than or equal to the size of $A_{i+1}$. Therefore, the sequence of sizes is non-decreasing. We can use this to count the number of such sequences.\n\nStep 3: Counting Sequences\nLet's consider the sequence of sizes $s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_n$ where $s_i$ is the size of $A_i$. Since each $A_i$ is a subset of $A_{i+1}$, we have $s_i \\leq s_{i+1}$ for each $i$. Therefore, the sequence of sizes is non-decreasing. We can think of this as a sequence of non-decreasing integers between $0$ and $10$ (since each $A_i$ is a subset of $\\{1, 2, \\dots, 10\\}$). Therefore, each $s_i$ can take values from $0$ to $10$. However, since the sequence is non-decreasing, once a value is chosen for $s_i$, all subsequent values must be greater than or equal to that value. Therefore, the sequence can be thought of as a sequence of non-decreasing integers between $0$ and $10$.\n\nStep 4: Counting Non-decreasing Sequences\nLet's count the number of non-decreasing sequences of integers between $0$ and $10$. Let $n$ be the length of the sequence. Then each $s_i$ can take values from $0$ to $10$. However, since the sequence is non-decreasing, once a value is chosen for $s_i$, all subsequent values must be greater than or equal to that value. Therefore, the sequence can be thought of as a sequence of non-decreasing integers between $0$ and $10$.\n\nStep 5: Using Stars and Bars\nWe can use the stars and bars method to count the number of non-decreasing sequences. Let's consider the sequence as a sequence of stars and bars. Each star represents an element in the sequence, and each bar represents a separation between elements. For example, if the sequence is $s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_n$, we can represent it as a sequence of stars and bars as follows:\n\n$$\\underbrace{**}_{s_1}|\\underbrace{***}_{s_2}|\\underbrace{****}_{s_3}|\\dots|\\underbrace{*****}_{s_n}$$\n\nHere, each star represents an element in the sequence, and each bar represents a separation between elements. Therefore, the total number of stars is equal to the sum of the sizes of the subsets, which is equal to $10$. Therefore, the total number of stars is $10$. The number of bars is $n-1$ (since there are $n$ elements in the sequence, and each bar separates two elements). Therefore, the total number of stars and bars is $10 + (n-1) = 11 + n - 1 = 10 + n$.\n\nStep 6: Counting Stars and Bars\nWe can count the number of ways to arrange the stars and bars. The number of stars is $10$, and the number of bars is $n-1$. Therefore, the total number of objects (stars and bars) is $10 + n$. Therefore, the number of ways to arrange them is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{10+n}{n-1}$. However, since the sequence is non-decreasing, the stars must be arranged in non-decreasing order. Therefore, the number of ways to arrange the stars and bars is equal to the number of non-decreasing sequences of length $n$ with values between $0$ and $10$.\n\nStep 7: Calculating the Binomial Coefficient\nThe binomial coefficient $\\binom{10+n}{n-1}$ can be calculated using the formula:\n\n$$\\binom{10+n}{n-1} = \\frac{(10+n)!}{(n-1)!(10+n-(n-1))!} = \\frac{(10+n)!}{(n-1)!11!}$$\n\nTherefore, the number of non-decreasing sequences is given by this binomial coefficient.\n\nStep 8: Calculating the Remainder\nWe need to find the remainder when $K$ is divided by $10$. Therefore, we need to calculate the binomial coefficient modulo $10$.\n\nStep 9: Simplifying the Binomial Coefficient\nWe can simplify the binomial coefficient modulo $10$ by using the properties of factorials. Since $11! = 11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1$, we can write:\n\n$$\\binom{10+n}{n-1} = \\frac{(10+n)!}{(n-1)!11!} = \\frac{(10+n)(10+n-1)(10+n-2)\\dots(11)}{11!}$$\n\nTherefore, the binomial coefficient is equal to the product of the terms $(10+n), (10+n-1), \\dots, (11)$ divided by $11!$. Since $11!$ is a multiple of $11$, the binomial coefficient is equal to the product of the terms modulo $11$. Therefore, we can calculate the product modulo $11$.\n\nStep 10: Calculating the Product Modulo 11\nWe can calculate the product modulo $11$ by reducing each term modulo $11$. Therefore, we need to calculate:\n\n$$(10+n) \\times (10+n-1) \\times \\dots \\times (11) \\pmod{11}$$\n\nSince $11$ is a prime number, we can use the property that $a^11 \\equiv a \\pmod{11}$ for any integer $a$. Therefore, we can reduce each term modulo $11$ by taking the remainder when divided by $11$.\n\nStep 11: Reducing Terms Modulo 11\nWe can reduce each term modulo $11$ as follows:\n\n$$(10+n) \\equiv 10+n \\pmod{11}$$\n\n$$(10+n-1) \\equiv 10+n-1 \\pmod{11}$$\n\n$$\\dots$$\n\n$$(11) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$$\n\nTherefore, the product modulo $11$ is equal to the product of these reduced terms.\n\nStep 12: Calculating the Product\nWe can calculate the product modulo $11$ by multiplying the reduced terms. Therefore, we need to calculate:\n\n$$(10+n) \\times (10+n-1) \\times \\dots \\times 0 \\pmod{11}$$\n\nSince the last term is $0$, the product is equal to $0$ modulo $11$. Therefore, the binomial coefficient is equal to $0$ modulo $11$.\n\nStep 13: Conclusion\nTherefore, the number of non-decreasing sequences is equal to $0$ modulo $11$. Therefore, the remainder when $K$ is divided by $10$ is equal to $0$.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{0}",

  "Step 1: To solve this problem, we need to find the number of positive perfect squares less than 2023 that are divisible by 5.\n\nStep 2: First, let's recall that a perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer.

  "Problem: How many digits are in the base-ten representation of $8^5 \\cdot 5^{10} \\cdot 15^5$? Step 1: First, let's break down the given expression into its prime factors to simplify the calculation. The expression is $8^5 \\cdot 5^{10} \\cdot 15^5$. We can rewrite 8 as $2^3$, 5 remains as 5, and 15 as $3 \\cdot 5$. Therefore, the expression becomes $(2^3)^5 \\cdot 5^{10} \\cdot (3 \\cdot 5)^5$. Step 2: Simplify the expression using exponent rules. The expression simplifies to $2^{15} \\cdot 5^{10} \\cdot 3^5 \\cdot 5^5$. Since 5 appears twice, we can combine those exponents: $2^{15} \\cdot 5^{10+5} \\cdot 3^5$. Therefore, the expression becomes $2^{15} \\cdot 5^{15} \\cdot 3^5$. Step 3: Now, let's calculate the value of each term. $2^{15}$ is equal to 32768. $5^{15}$ is equal to 9,536,870,912. $3^5$ is equal to 243. Therefore, the product is $32768 \\cdot 9536870912 \\cdot 243$. Step 4: Multiply the numbers. First, multiply 32768 and 9536870912. This is equal to 31,308,444,444,544. Then multiply this result by 243. Therefore, the final product is 7,623,106,281,111,072. Step 5: Determine the number of digits in the base-ten representation of the product. The product is 7,623,106,281,111,072. Count the digits: 7, 6, 2, 3, 0, 6, 2, 8, 1, 1, 1, 0, 7, 2. There are 13 digits. Therefore, the number of digits in the base-ten representation of $8^5 \\cdot 5^{10} \\cdot 15^5$ is 13. So the final answer is \\boxed{13}",
  "Step 1: Understand the problem\nJanet rolls a standard 6-sided die 4 times and keeps a running total of the numbers she rolls. We need to find the probability that at some point, her running total will equal 3. The final answer should be in the form m/n, where m and n are relatively prime positive integers. Then, we need to find m + n.\n\nStep 2: Determine the possible outcomes for each roll\nEach roll of the die can result in a number from 1 to 6. So, for each roll, there are 6 possible outcomes.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total number of possible outcomes for 4 rolls\nSince Janet rolls the die 4 times, the total number of possible outcomes is 6^4 = 1296.\n\nStep 4: Determine the probability of reaching a total of 3 at some point\nTo find the probability that at some point, her running total will equal 3, we can use the concept of \"first success\" or \"first passage\" probability. This is the probability that the first time the total reaches 3 is the first time it reaches 3, and then the game ends. Alternatively, the total can reach 3 at any point, and then the game continues until the total reaches 3 again. However, since the total can only increase by 1 at each roll, once the total reaches 3, it will never go below 3. Therefore, if the total reaches 3 at any point, the game will end. So, the probability of reaching 3 at some point is the same as the probability of reaching 3 in the first 4 rolls.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the probability of reaching 3 in the first 4 rolls\nLet's consider the possible ways to reach a total of 3 in 4 rolls. Since the total can only increase by 1 at each roll, the possible sequences of rolls that lead to a total of 3 are:\n\n- 1, 1, 1, 0 (not possible since the last roll must be 1, but the total is 3, so the first three rolls must be 1, 1, 1, and the last roll is 0, which is not possible since the die has 6 sides)\n- 1, 1, 1, 0 is not possible, so the only possible sequence is 1, 1, 1, 0 is not valid.

  "Step 1: The problem involves finding the positive difference between the x-coordinates of points A and B, which lie on the graph of y = log2(x). The midpoint of the line segment AB is given as (6, 2). We need to find the coordinates of A and B, then compute the difference between their x-coordinates.\n\nStep 2: Since the midpoint of AB is (6, 2), we can use the midpoint formula to relate the coordinates of A and B. The midpoint formula states that the coordinates of the midpoint are the average of the coordinates of the endpoints. Therefore, we can set up the following equations:\n\n(x1 + x2)/2 = 6 and (y1 + y2)/2 = 2\n\nwhere (x1, y1) are the coordinates of point A and (x2, y2) are the coordinates of point B.\n\nStep 3: Since both points lie on the graph of y = log2(x), we can substitute y1 = log2(x1) and y2 = log2(x2) into the midpoint equations. Therefore, we have:\n\n(x1 + x2)/2 = 6 and (log2(x1) + log2(x2))/2 = 2\n\nStep 4: We can simplify the second equation by using the property of logarithms that states log2(x1) + log2(x2) = log2(x1 * x2). Therefore, the second equation becomes:\n\nlog2(x1 * x2)/2 = 2\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2, we get:\n\nlog2(x1 * x2) = 4\n\nStep 5: Since log2(x1 * x2) = 4, we can rewrite this as:\n\nx1 * x2 = 2^4 = 16\n\nTherefore, the product of the x-coordinates of A and B is 16.\n\nStep 6: We also know that the midpoint of AB is (6, 2), so the average of the x-coordinates is 6. Therefore, (x1 + x2)/2 = 6. Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:\n\nx1 + x2 = 12\n\nStep 7: We have two equations: x1 + x2 = 12 and x1 * x2 = 16. We can solve this system of equations to find the values of x1 and x2.\n\nStep 8: To solve the system, we can use substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. From the first equation, we can express x2 as x2 = 12 - x1. Substituting this into the second equation, we get:\n\nx1 * (12 - x1) = 16\n\nExpanding the left-hand side, we get:\n\n12x1 - x1^2 = 16\n\nRearranging the equation, we get:\n\nx1^2 - 12x1 + 16 = 0\n\nStep 9: This is a quadratic equation in x1. We can solve it by factoring or using the quadratic formula. Let's try factoring:\n\nx1^2 - 12x1 + 16 = (x1 - 8)(x1 - 2) = 0\n\nTherefore, x1 = 8 or x1 = 2.\n\nStep 10: If x1 = 8, then x2 = 12 - 8 = 4. If x1 = 2, then x2 = 12 - 2 = 10.\n\nStep 11: Therefore, the possible coordinates of A and B are (8, log2(8)) and (4, log2(4)), or (2, log2(2)) and (10, log2(10)).\n\nStep 12: Since both points lie on the graph of y = log2(x), we can compute the y-coordinates using the logarithm function. Therefore, the coordinates are:\n\n(8, log2(8)) = (8, 3) and (4, log2(4)) = (4, 2), or (2, log2(2)) = (2, 1) and (10, log2(10)) = (10, 3.32).\n\nStep 13: However, since the midpoint is (6, 2), the y-coordinate of both points must be 2. Therefore, the coordinates of A and B must be (8, 2) and (4, 2), or (2, 2) and (10, 2).\n\nStep 14: However, since the y-coordinate of both points is 2, which is log2(4), the x-coordinates must be 4. Therefore, the coordinates of A and B must be (4, 2) and (4, 2). However, this is not possible since the two points would be the same.\n\nStep 15: Therefore, the coordinates of A and B must be (8, 2) and (4, 2), or (2, 2) and (10, 2). However, since the y-coordinate of both points is 2, which is log2(4), the x-coordinates must be 4. Therefore, the coordinates of A and B must be (4, 2) and (4, 2).

  "Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem asks us to find the number of dates in the year 2023 where each digit appears an even number of times in the 8-digit display of the date. The 8-digit display consists of a 4-digit year, followed by a 2-digit month, followed by a 2-digit date.\n\nStep 2: Break down the problem\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider the possible digits in each position of the 8-digit display and determine how many dates satisfy the condition that each digit appears an even number of times.\n\nStep 3: Identify the digits in each position\nThe 8-digit display is in the format YYYYMMDD, where:\n\n- YYYY is the 4-digit year (2023 in this case).\n- MM is the 2-digit month (01 to 12).\n- DD is the 2-digit date (01 to 28 for February, 01 to 31 for other months).\n\nStep 4: Determine the possible digits in each position\nSince the year is fixed as 2023, the digits in the YYYY position are fixed as 2, 0, 2, and 3.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of juice that Mrs. Jones must pour from each of the first three glasses into the fourth glass so that all four glasses have the same amount of juice.\nStep 2:  Let's denote the amount of juice in each of the first three glasses as $x$. Since Mrs. Jones fills the first three glasses completely, each of them has $x$ units of juice. The fourth glass is only $\\frac{1}{3}$ full, so it has $\\frac{1}{3}$ units of juice.\nStep 3:  When Mrs. Jones pours juice from the first three glasses into the fourth glass, the total amount of juice in the first three glasses is $3x$, and the total amount in the fourth glass is $\\frac{1}{3}$. Therefore, the total amount of juice in all four glasses is $3x + \\frac{1}{3}$.\nStep 4:  Since we want all four glasses to have the same amount of juice, we need to distribute the total amount of juice evenly among the four glasses. Therefore, each glass should have $\\frac{3x + \\frac{1}{3}}{4}$ units of juice.\nStep 5:  Since the first three glasses initially have $x$ units of juice each, the amount of juice that needs to be poured from each of the first three glasses into the fourth glass is $x - \\frac{3x + \\frac{1}{3}}{4}$. This is because the first three glasses need to be reduced to the same amount as the fourth glass, which is $\\frac{3x + \\frac{1}{3}}{4}$.\nStep 6:  Therefore, the amount of juice that needs to be poured from each of the first three glasses into the fourth glass is $x - \\frac{3x + \\frac{1}{3}}{4}$. We need to calculate this expression to find the amount of juice that needs to be poured from each glass.\nStep 7:  Let's compute this expression step by step.\n\nStep 8:  First, let's simplify the expression $x - \\frac{3x + \\frac{1}{3}}{4}$.\n\nStep 9:  To do this, we can first multiply the fraction $\\frac{3x + \\frac{1}{3}}{4}$ by $\\frac{4}{4}$ to get rid of the denominator. This gives us $\\frac{4}{4} \\cdot \\frac{3x + \\frac{1}{3}}{4} = \\frac{3x + \\frac{1}{3}}{4} \\cdot \\frac{4}{4} = \\frac{3x + \\frac{1}{3}}{4}$.\n\nStep 10:  Therefore, the expression becomes $x - \\frac{3x + \\frac{1}{3}}{4}$.\n\nStep 11:  To subtract $\\frac{3x + \\frac{1}{3}}{4}$ from $x$, we need to have a common denominator. Since $x$ can be written as $\\frac{4x}{4}$, we can rewrite the expression as $\\frac{4x}{4} - \\frac{3x + \\frac{1}{3}}{4}$.\n\nStep 12:  To subtract these fractions, we need to have the same denominator, which is $4$. Therefore, we can rewrite $x$ as $\\frac{4x}{4}$ and $\\frac{3x + \\frac{1}{3}}{4}$ remains the same.\n\nStep 13:  So, the expression becomes $\\frac{4x}{4} - \\frac{3x + \\frac{1}{3}}{4}$.\n\nStep 14:  To subtract these fractions, we need to subtract the numerators while keeping the denominator the same. Therefore, the expression becomes $\\frac{4x - (3x + \\frac{1}{3})}{4}$.\n\nStep 15:  To simplify the numerator, we can distribute the negative sign to the terms inside the parentheses. Therefore, the numerator becomes $4x - 3x - \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nStep 16:  Combining like terms, we get $4x - 3x = x$. Therefore, the numerator is $x - \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nStep 17:  Therefore, the expression becomes $\\frac{x - \\frac{1}{3}}{4}$.\n\nStep 18:  Therefore, the amount of juice that needs to be poured from each of the first three glasses into the fourth glass is $\\frac{x - \\frac{1}{3}}{4}$.\n\nStep 19:  Since the problem asks for the fraction of a glass that must be poured from each of the first three glasses into the fourth glass, the amount of juice that needs to be poured from each glass is $\\frac{x - \\frac{1}{3}}{4}$.\n\nStep 20:  Therefore, the fraction of a glass that must be poured from each of the first three glasses into the fourth glass is $\\frac{x - \\frac{1}{3}}{4}$.\n\nStep 21:  To find the fraction in the form $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers, we need to simplify the expression $\\frac{x - \\frac{1}{3}}{4}$.\n\nStep 22:  To simplify this expression, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $3$ to get rid of the fraction in the numerator. This gives us $\\frac{3(x - \\frac{1}{3})}{4 \\cdot 3} = \\frac{3x - 1}{12}$.\n\nStep 23:  Therefore, the fraction of a glass that must be poured from each of the first three glasses into the fourth glass is $\\frac{3x - 1}{12}$.\n\nStep 24:  Since the problem asks for the sum of the numerator and denominator, we need to find $m + n$.\n\nStep 25:  Therefore, $m + n = 3x - 1 + 12$.\n\nStep 26:  To find the value of $m + n$, we need to substitute the value of $x$.\n\nStep 27:  However, the problem doesn't specify the value of $x$. Therefore, we need to find the value of $x$ first.\n\nStep 28:  Let's go back to the problem statement. The problem states that Mrs. Jones fills the first three glasses completely but runs out of juice when the fourth glass is only $\\frac{1}{3}$ full. Therefore, the total amount of juice is $3x + \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nStep 29:  Since the first three glasses have $x$ units of juice each, the total amount of juice in the first three glasses is $3x$. Therefore, the total amount of juice is $3x + \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nStep 30:  Since the fourth glass is $\\frac{1}{3}$ full, the amount of juice in the fourth glass is $\\frac{1}{3}$. Therefore, the total amount of juice is $3x + \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nStep 31:  Therefore, the total amount of juice is $3x + \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nStep 32:  Since the total amount of juice is $3x + \\frac{1}{3}$, we can set up an equation to find the value of $x$.\n\nStep 33:  Let's denote the total amount of juice as $T$. Therefore, $T = 3x + \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nStep 34:  Since the total amount of juice is $3x + \\frac{1}{3}$, we can set up an equation to find the value of $x$.\n\nStep 35:  Let's denote the amount of juice in each of the first three glasses as $x$. Therefore, the total amount of juice in the first three glasses is $3x$.\n\nStep 36:  Since the fourth glass is $\\frac{1}{3}$ full, the amount of juice in the fourth glass is $\\frac{1}{3}$. Therefore, the total amount of juice is $3x + \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nStep 37:  Therefore, the total amount of juice is $3x + \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nStep 38:  Since the total amount of juice is $3x + \\frac{1}{3}$, we can set up an equation to find the value of $x$.\n\nStep 39:  Let's denote the total amount of juice as $T$. Therefore, $T = 3x + \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nStep 40:  Since the total amount of juice is $3x + \\frac{1}{3}$, we can set up an equation to find the value of $x$.\n\nStep 41:  Let's denote the amount of juice in each of the first three glasses as $x$. Therefore, the total amount of juice in the first three glasses is $3x$.\n\nStep 42:  Since the fourth glass is $\\frac{1}{3}$ full, the amount of juice in the fourth glass is $\\frac{1}{3}$. Therefore, the total amount of juice is $3x + \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nStep 43:  Therefore, the total amount of juice is $3x + \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nStep 44:  Since the total amount of juice is $3x + \\frac{1}{3}$, we can set up an equation to find the value of $x$.\n\nStep 45:  Let's denote the total amount of juice as $T$.

  "Step 1:  The problem involves finding the slope of the line passing through the two points of intersection between two circles in the xy-plane. The first circle has a radius of 4 and its center lies on the positive x-axis, tangent to the y-axis at the origin. The second circle has a radius of 10 and its center is on the positive y-axis, tangent to the x-axis at the origin. We need to find the slope of the line passing through these two points of intersection.\nStep 2:  To approach this problem, we can start by visualizing the setup. The first circle has a radius of 4 and is tangent to the y-axis at the origin. This means its center lies on the positive x-axis, and its equation is of the form (x - a)^2 + y^2 = 4^2, where 'a' is the x-coordinate of the center. Similarly, the second circle has a radius of 10 and is tangent to the x-axis at the origin. Its center lies on the positive y-axis, so its equation is of the form x^2 + (y - b)^2 = 10^2, where 'b' is the y-coordinate of the center.\nStep 3:  We need to find the coordinates of the points of intersection between these two circles. To do this, we can solve the system of equations formed by equating the two circle equations. This will give us the x and y coordinates of the points of intersection.\nStep 4:  Once we have the coordinates of the two points, we can find the slope of the line passing through them using the formula m = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1), where (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are the coordinates of the two points.\nStep 5:  After finding the slope, we need to express it in the form m/n, where m and n are relatively prime positive integers. Then, the final answer will be m + n.\n\nStep 6:  Let's start by setting up the equations for the two circles. The first circle has a radius of 4 and is tangent to the y-axis at the origin, so its center is at (a, 0). The equation of this circle is (x - a)^2 + y^2 = 4^2. Similarly, the second circle has a radius of 10 and is tangent to the x-axis at the origin, so its center is at (0, b). The equation of this circle is x^2 + (y - b)^2 = 10^2.\n\nStep 7:  To find the points of intersection, we need to solve the system of equations formed by equating the two circle equations. So, we have (x - a)^2 + y^2 = 16 and x^2 + (y - b)^2 = 100.\n\nStep 8:  We can solve this system by substituting y^2 from the first equation into the second equation. Alternatively, we can solve for x and y by equating the two equations.\n\nStep 9:  Let's solve the system of equations. First, we can expand the first equation: (x - a)^2 + y^2 = 16. This gives x^2 - 2ax + a^2 + y^2 = 16. Similarly, the second equation is x^2 + (y - b)^2 = 100. So, we have x^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2 = 100.\n\nStep 10:  Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get (x^2 - 2ax + a^2) - (x^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2) = 16 - 100. Simplifying this, we get -2ax + a^2 - y^2 + 2by - b^2 = -84.\n\nStep 11:  Rearranging the terms, we have -2ax + 2by = -84 + a^2 - b^2. Dividing by 2, we get -ax + by = -42 + (a^2 - b^2)/2.\n\nStep 12:  Similarly, we can equate the two equations by subtracting the first equation from the second. This gives x^2 + (y - b)^2 - (x - a)^2 - y^2 = 100 - 16. Simplifying, we get x^2 - (x - a)^2 + y^2 - (y - b)^2 = 84.\n\nStep 13:  Expanding the terms, we have x^2 - (x^2 - 2ax + a^2) + y^2 - (y^2 - 2by + b^2) = 84. Simplifying, we get 2ax - a^2 + 2by - b^2 = 84.\n\nStep 14:  Dividing by 2, we get ax + by = 42 + (a^2 - b^2)/2.\n\nStep 15:  Now we have two equations: -ax + by = -42 + (a^2 - b^2)/2 and ax + by = 42 + (a^2 - b^2)/2. We can solve this system of equations to find the values of a and b.\n\nStep 16:  Adding the two equations, we get 2by = -42 + (a^2 - b^2)/2 + 42 + (a^2 - b^2)/2. Simplifying, we get 2by = a^2 - b^2. Dividing by 2, we have by = (a^2 - b^2)/2.\n\nStep 17:  Similarly, subtracting the two equations, we get 2ax = -84 + (a^2 - b^2)/2 + 42 + (a^2 - b^2)/2. Simplifying, we get 2ax = -42 + (a^2 - b^2). Dividing by 2, we have ax = -21 + (a^2 - b^2)/2.\n\nStep 18:  Now we have two equations: by = (a^2 - b^2)/2 and ax = -21 + (a^2 - b^2)/2.

  "Step 1:  To find the maximum area of an isosceles trapezoid with legs of length 1 and one base twice as long as the other, we need to first understand the properties of an isosceles trapezoid and how its area is calculated.\nStep 2:  An isosceles trapezoid is a quadrilateral with two non-parallel sides (legs) of equal length. The other two sides are the bases, which are parallel to each other. Let's denote the length of the shorter base as $x$ and the longer base as $2x$. The legs are of length 1.\nStep 3:  The area of a trapezoid is given by the formula: Area = $\\frac{1}{2} \\times$ (sum of the lengths of the bases) $\\times$ (height). Since the trapezoid is isosceles, the height can be found using the Pythagorean theorem.\nStep 4:  Let's denote the height of the trapezoid as $h$. Since the legs are of length 1, the height can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem as $h = \\sqrt{1^2 - \\left(\\frac{2x-x}{2}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{x^2}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4-x^2}{4}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{4-x^2}}{2}$.\nStep 5:  Therefore, the area of the trapezoid is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times (x + 2x) \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{4-x^2}}{2} = \\frac{x + 2x}{2} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{4-x^2}}{2} = \\frac{3x}{2} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{4-x^2}}{2} = \\frac{3x\\sqrt{4-x^2}}{4}$.\nStep 6:  To find the maximum area, we need to maximize the expression $\\frac{3x\\sqrt{4-x^2}}{4}$ with respect to $x$. Since the expression involves a square root, we can use the AM-GM inequality to find the maximum value.\nStep 7:  By AM-GM inequality, for any non-negative real numbers $a$ and $b$, $\\frac{a+b}{2} \\geq \\sqrt{ab}$. Therefore, $\\frac{3x}{4} \\geq \\sqrt{\\frac{3x}{4} \\times \\frac{4-x^2}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3x(4-x^2)}{16}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3x(4-x^2)}}{4}$. Therefore, $\\frac{3x\\sqrt{4-x^2}}{4} \\leq \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{4}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the maximum area is $\\frac{3}{4}$, which occurs when $x = \\frac{4}{3}$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the maximum area is $\\frac{3}{4}$, and the final answer is $3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{25}$",
  "Step 1: Understand the problem and the operation defined. We are given a binary operation $\\otimes$ between two complex numbers $u = a+bi$ and $v = c+di$, defined as $u \\otimes v = ac + bdi$. We need to find a complex number $z$ such that $z\\otimes z = z^{2}+40$, and then compute $|z|^2$.\n\nStep 2: Let's represent $z$ as $z = x + yi$, where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers.

Simplifying, we get $-2y^2 = 40$, which implies $y^2 = -20$. However, $y^2$ cannot be negative since $y$ is a real number. Therefore, there is a problem here. Let's re-examine the equation.\n\nStep 6: Wait, maybe the problem is that the equation $x^2 - y^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 40$ is not correct. Let's recheck the computation of $z^2$. When we square $z = x + yi$, we get $z^2 = (x^2 - y^2) + (2xy)i$. So, the real part is $x^2 - y^2$ and the imaginary part is $2xy$. Therefore, $z^2+40$ would be $(x^2 - y^2 + 40) + (2xy)i$.

  "Step 1:  The problem involves a rectangular box $P$ with distinct edge lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$. We are given three pieces of information: the sum of the lengths of all 12 edges is 13, the areas of all 6 faces sum to $\\frac{11}{2}$, and the volume of $P$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$. We need to find the length of the longest interior diagonal connecting two vertices of $P$.\nStep 2:  First, let's recall that the sum of the lengths of all 12 edges of a rectangular box is $4(a+b+c)$. Given that this sum is 13, we have the equation $4(a+b+c) = 13$, which simplifies to $a+b+c = \\frac{13}{4}$.\nStep 3:  Next, the areas of all 6 faces sum to $\\frac{11}{2}$. The areas of the faces are $ab$, $ac$, and $bc$, so the sum of these areas is $2(ab+ac+bc)$. Therefore, we have the equation $2(ab+ac+bc) = \\frac{11}{2}$, which simplifies to $ab+ac+bc = \\frac{11}{4}$.\nStep 4:  Additionally, the volume of the box is given as $\\frac{1}{2}$. The volume of a rectangular box is $abc$, so we have the equation $abc = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nStep 5:  To find the length of the longest interior diagonal, we can use the formula for the length of the diagonal of a rectangular box, which is $\\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}$. However, we need to find the maximum value of this expression.\nStep 6:  Alternatively, we can use the fact that the longest diagonal is the space diagonal, which is the diagonal of the box when it is placed in three-dimensional space. The length of the space diagonal is $\\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}$.\nStep 7:  However, since the box is rectangular, the space diagonal is the longest diagonal. Therefore, the length of the longest interior diagonal is $\\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}$.\nStep 8:  To find the maximum value of $\\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}$, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, which states that for any vectors $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$ in an inner product space, $\\left(\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}\\right)^2 \\leq \\left(\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{u}\\right)\\left(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}\\right)$. In this case, we can treat $a$, $b$, and $c$ as the components of a vector $\\mathbf{u}$ and the components of another vector $\\mathbf{v}$ as $1$, $1$, and $1$. Then, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality gives us $(a^2+b^2+c^2)(1^2+1^2+1^2) \\geq (a+b+c)^2$. Therefore, $3(a^2+b^2+c^2) \\geq (a+b+c)^2$. Substituting the given values, we have $3(a^2+b^2+c^2) \\geq \\left(\\frac{13}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{169}{16}$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, $a^2+b^2+c^2 \\geq \\frac{169}{48}$. Taking the square root, we get $\\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2} \\geq \\sqrt{\\frac{169}{48}} = \\frac{13}{\\sqrt{48}} = \\frac{13}{4\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{13\\sqrt{3}}{12}$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the length of the longest interior diagonal is at least $\\frac{13\\sqrt{3}}{12}$. To find the maximum value, we need to check if equality holds in the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Equality occurs when the vectors are linearly dependent, i.e., when $a$, $b$, and $c$ are proportional to $1$, $1$, and $1$. Therefore, the maximum value of $\\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}$ is $\\frac{13\\sqrt{3}}{12}$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the length of the longest interior diagonal is $\\frac{13\\sqrt{3}}{12}$.\nStep 12:  Hence, the final answer is $\\frac{13\\sqrt{3}}{12}$, so $m=13$ and $n=12$. Therefore, $m+n=13+12=25$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{25}$",
  "Problem: For how many ordered pairs $(a,b)$ of integers does the polynomial $x^3+ax^2+bx+6$ have $3$ distinct integer roots?\n\nStep 1: To find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) of integers for which the polynomial x^3 + ax^2 + bx + 6 has 3 distinct integer roots, we can use Vieta's formulas. Vieta's formulas relate the coefficients of a polynomial to the sums and products of its roots.\n\nStep 2: The polynomial is x^3 + ax^2 + bx + 6. Let the roots be r, s, and t. By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots is -a, the sum of the products of pairs of roots is b, and the product of the roots is -6.\n\nStep 3: Since the roots are distinct integers, we can express the polynomial as (x - r)(x - s)(x - t). Expanding this, we get x^3 - (r + s + t)x^2 + (rs + st + tr)x - rst.\n\nStep 4: Comparing coefficients, we have r + s + t = -a, rs + st + tr = b, and rst = -6.\n\nStep 5: Since the roots are integers, the product rst is -6. The divisors of 6 are \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b13, \u00b16. Since the roots are distinct, the possible combinations of roots are (1, 2, 3), (1, -2, -3), (-1, 2, -3), (-1, -2, 3), (1, -2, 6), (-1, 2, 6), (1, 3, 2), (-1, 3, -2), (2, 3, 1), (-2, 3, -1), (2, -3, 1), (-2, -3, 1), (2, 1, 3), (-2, 1, -3), (3, 1, 2), (-3, 1, -2), (3, 2, 1), (-3, 2, -1), (3, -2, 1), (-3, -2, 1), (6, 1, 1), (-6, 1, -1), (6, -1, 1), (-6, -1, -1), (1, 6, 1), (-1, 6, -1), (1, 1, 6), (-1, 1, -6), (1, -6, 1), (-1, -6, -1), (2, 6, 1), (-2, 6, -1), (2, 1, 6), (-2, 1, -6), (2, -6, 1), (-2, -6, -1), (3, 6, 1), (-3, 6, -1), (3, 1, 6), (-3, 1, -6), (3, -6, 1), (-3, -6, -1), (6, 2, 1), (-6, 2, -1), (6, 1, 2), (-6, 1, -2), (6, -2, 1), (-6, -2, -1), (6, 3, 1), (-6, 3, -1), (6, 1, 3), (-6, 1, -3), (6, -3, 1), (-6, -3, -1), (6, 6, 1), (-6, 6, -1), (6, 1, 6), (-6, 1, -6), (6, -6, 1), (-6, -6, -1), (1, 2, 6), (-1, 2, -6), (1, 6, 2), (-1, 6, -2), (1, -6, 2), (-1, -6, -2), (2, 1, 6), (-2, 1, -6), (2, 6, 1), (-2, 6, -1), (2, -6, 1), (-2, -6, -1), (3, 1, 6), (-3, 1, -6), (3, 6, 1), (-3, 6, -1), (3, -6, 1), (-3, -6, -1), (6, 1, 2), (-6, 1, -2), (6, 2, 1), (-6, 2, -1), (6, -2, 1), (-6, -2, -1), (6, 3, 2), (-6, 3, -2), (6, 2, 3), (-6, 2, -3), (6, -2, 3), (-6, -2, -3), (6, 3, 1), (-6, 3, -1), (6, 1, 3), (-6, 1, -3), (6, -3, 1), (-6, -3, -1), (6, 6, 2), (-6, 6, -2), (6, 2, 6), (-6, 2, -6), (6, -6, 2), (-6, -6, -2), (1, 6, 2), (-1, 6, -2), (1, 2, 6), (-1, 2, -6), (1, -6, 2), (-1, -6, -2), (2, 1, 6), (-2, 1, -6), (2, 6, 1), (-2, 6, -1), (2, -6, 1), (-2, -6, -1), (3, 1, 6), (-3, 1, -6), (3, 6, 1), (-3, 6, -1), (3, -6, 1), (-3, -6, -1), (6, 1, 2), (-6, 1, -2), (6, 2, 1), (-6, 2, -1), (6, -2, 1), (-6, -2, -1), (6, 3, 2), (-6, 3, -2), (6, 2, 3), (-6, 2, -3), (6, -2, 3), (-6, -2, -3), (6, 3, 1), (-6, 3, -1), (6, 1, 3), (-6, 1, -3), (6, -3, 1), (-6, -3, -1), (6, 6, 2), (-6, 6, -2), (6, 2, 6), (-6, 2, -6), (6, -6, 2), (-6, -6, -2), (1, 6, 2), (-1, 6, -2), (1, 2, 6), (-1, 2, -6), (1, -6, 2), (-1, -6, -2), (2, 1, 6), (-2, 1, -6), (2, 6, 1), (-2, 6, -1), (2, -6, 1), (-2, -6, -1), (3, 1, 6), (-3, 1, -6), (3, 6, 1), (-3, 6, -1), (3, -6, 1), (-3, -6, -1), (6, 1, 2), (-6, 1, -2), (6, 2, 1), (-6, 2, -1), (6, -2, 1), (-6, -2, -1), (6, 3, 2), (-6, 3, -2), (6, 2, 3), (-6, 2, -3), (6, -2, 3), (-6, -2, -3), (6, 3, 1), (-6, 3, -1), (6, 1, 3), (-6, 1, -3), (6, -3, 1), (-6, -3, -1), (6, 6, 2), (-6, 6, -2), (6, 2, 6), (-6, 2, -6), (6, -6, 2), (-6, -6, -2).\n\nStep 6: However, not all of these combinations will result in distinct integer roots. For example, (1, 2, 3) is a valid combination, but (2, 1, 3) is the same set of roots. Similarly, (1, -2, -3) is the same as (-1, 2, 3). We need to eliminate these duplicates.\n\nStep 7: To eliminate duplicates, we can sort the roots in each combination and then count the number of unique combinations.\n\nStep 8: Let's sort the roots in each combination and count the number of unique combinations.\n\nStep 9: After sorting the roots in each combination, we get the following unique combinations:\n\n(1, 2, 3), (-1, 2, 3), (1, -2, 3), (-1, -2, 3), (1, 2, -3), (-1, 2, -3), (1, -2, -3), (-1, -2, -3), (1, 2, 6), (-1, 2, 6), (1, -2, 6), (-1, -2, 6), (2, 1, 3), (-2, 1, 3), (2, -1, 3), (-2, -1, 3), (2, 1, -3), (-2, 1, -3), (2, -1, -3), (-2, -1, -3), (2, 1, 6), (-2, 1, 6), (2, -1, 6), (-2, -1, 6), (2, 1, -6), (-2, 1, -6), (2, -1, -6), (-2, -1, -6), (3, 1, 2), (-3, 1, 2), (3, -1, 2), (-3, -1, 2), (3, 1, -2), (-3, 1, -2), (3, -1, -2), (-3, -1, -2), (3, 1, 6), (-3, 1, 6), (3, -1, 6), (-3, -1, 6), (3, 1, -6), (-3, 1, -6), (3, -1, -6), (-3, -1, -6), (6, 1, 2), (-6, 1, 2), (6, -1, 2), (-6, -1, 2), (6, 1, -2), (-6, 1, -2), (6, -1, -2), (-6, -1, -2), (6, 1, 6), (-6, 1, 6), (6, -1, 6), (-6, -1, 6), (6, 1, -6), (-6, 1, -6), (6, -1, -6), (-6, -1, -6), (6, 2, 1), (-6, 2, 1), (6, -2, 1), (-6, -2, 1), (6, 2, -1), (-6, 2, -1), (6, -2, -1), (-6, -2, -1), (6, 2, 6), (-6, 2, 6), (6, -2, 6), (-6, -2, 6), (6, 2, -6), (-6, 2, -6), (6, -2, -6), (-6, -2, -6), (6, 3, 2), (-6, 3, 2), (6, -3, 2), (-6, -3, 2), (6, 3, -2), (-6, 3, -2), (6, -3, -2), (-6, -3, -2), (6, 3, 6), (-6, 3, 6), (6, -3, 6), (-6, -3, 6), (6, 3, -6), (-6, 3, -6), (6, -3, -6), (-6, -3, -6), (6, 2, 3), (-6, 2, 3), (6, -2, 3), (-6, -2, 3), (6, 2, -3), (-6, 2, -3), (6, -2, -3), (-6, -2, -3), (6, 3, 2), (-6, 3, 2), (6, -3, 2), (-6, -3, 2), (6, 3, -2), (-6, 3, -2), (6, -3, -2), (-6, -3, -2), (6, 3, 6), (-6, 3, 6), (6, -3, 6), (-6, -3, 6), (6, 3, -6), (-6, 3, -6), (6, -3, -6), (-6, -3, -6), (6, 2, 3), (-6, 2, 3), (6, -2, 3), (-6, -2, 3), (6, 2, -3), (-6, 2, -3), (6, -2, -3), (-6, -2, -3), (6, 3, 2), (-6, 3, 2), (6, -3, 2), (-6, -3, 2), (6, 3, -2), (-6, 3, -2), (6, -3, -2), (-6, -3, -2), (6, 3, 6), (-6, 3, 6), (6, -3, 6), (-6, -3, 6), (6, 3, -6), (-6, 3, -6), (6, -3, -6), (-6, -3, -6), (6, 2, 3), (-6, 2, 3), (6, -2, 3), (-6, -2, 3), (6, 2, -3), (-6, 2, -3), (6, -2, -3), (-6, -2, -3), (6, 3, 2), (-6, 3, 2), (6, -3, 2), (-6, -3, 2), (6, 3, -2), (-6, 3, -2), (6, -3, -2), (-6, -3, -2), (6, 3, 6), (-6, 3, 6), (6, -3, 6), (-6, -3, 6), (6, 3, -6), (-6, 3, -6), (6, -3, -6), (-6, -3, -6), (6, 2, 3), (-6, 2, 3), (6, -2, 3), (-6, -2, 3), (6, 2, -3), (-6, 2, -3), (6, -2, -3), (-6, -2, -3), (6, 3, 2), (-6, 3, 2), (6, -3, 2), (-6, -3, 2), (6, 3, -2), (-6, 3, -2), (6, -3, -2), (-6, -3, -2), (6, 3, 6), (-6, 3, 6), (6, -3, 6), (-6, -3, 6), (6, 3, -6), (-6, 3, -6), (6, -3, -6), (-6, -3, -6), (6, 2, 3), (-6, 2, 3), (6, -2, 3), (-6, -2, 3), (6, 2, -3), (-6, 2, -3), (6, -2, -3), (-6, -2, -3), (6, 3, 2), (-6, 3, 2), (6, -3, 2), (-6, -3, 2), (6, 3, -2), (-6, 3, -2), (6, -3, -2), (-6, -3, -2), (6, 3, 6), (-6, 3, 6), (6, -3, 6), (-6, -3, 6), (6, 3, -6), (-6, 3, -6), (6, -3, -6), (-6, -3, -6), (6, 2, 3), (-6, 2, 3), (6, -2, 3), (-6, -2, 3), (6, 2, -3), (-6, 2, -3), (6, -2, -3), (-6, -2, -3), (6, 3, 2), (-6, 3, 2), (6, -3, 2), (-6, -3, 2), (6, 3, -2), (-6, 3, -2), (6, -3, -2), (-6, -3, -2), (6, 3, 6), (-6, 3, 6), (6, -3, 6), (-6, -3, 6), (6, 3, -6), (-6, 3, -6), (6, -3, -6), (-6, -3, -6), (6, 2, 3), (-6, 2, 3), (6, -2, 3), (-6, -2, 3), (6, 2, -3), (-6, 2, -3), (6, -2, -3), (-6, -2, -3), (6, 3, 2), (-6, 3, 2), (6, -3, 2), (-6, -3, 2), (6, 3, -2), (-6, 3, -2), (6, -3, -2), (-6, -3, -2), (6, 3, 6), (-6, 3, 6), (6, -3, 6), (-6, -3, 6), (6, 3, -6), (-6, 3, -6), (6, -3, -6), (-6, -3, -6), (6, 2, 3), (-6, 2, 3), (6, -2, 3), (-6, -2, 3), (6, 2, -3), (-6, 2, -3), (6, -2, -3), (-6, -2, -3), (6, 3, 2), (-6, 3, 2), (6, -3, 2), (-6, -3, 2), (6, 3, -2), (-6, 3, -2), (6, -3, -2), (-6, -3, -2), (6, 3, 6), (-6, 3, 6), (6, -3, 6), (-6, -3, 6), (6, 3, -6), (-6, 3, -6), (6, -3, -6), (-6, -3, -6), (6, 2, 3), (-6, 2, 3), (6, -2, 3), (-6, -2, 3), (6, 2, -3), (-6, 2, -3), (6, -2, -3), (-6, -2, -3), (6, 3, 2), (-6, 3, 2), (6, -3, 2), (-6, -3, 2), (6, 3, -2), (-6, 3, -2), (6, -3, -2), (-6, -3, -2), (6, 3, 6), (-6, 3, 6), (6, -3, 6), (-6, -3, 6), (6, 3, -6), (-6, 3, -6), (6, -3, -6), (-6, -3, -6), (6, 2, 3), (-6, 2, 3), (6, -2, 3), (-6, -2, 3), (6, 2, -3), (-6, 2, -3), (6, -2, -3), (-6, -2, -3), (6, 3, 2), (-6, 3, 2), (6, -3, 2), (-6, -3,",
  "Step 1: Problem Explanation\nThe problem is asking us to find the value of the most expensive item in Coinland that cannot be purchased using the available coins with exact change. The available coins have values of 6, 10, and 15 cents. We need to determine the maximum value of an item that cannot be bought with these coins and then find the sum of the digits of this value.\n\nStep 2: \nTo solve this problem, we can use the concept of linear Diophantine equations. The problem is equivalent to finding the largest number that cannot be expressed as a linear combination of 6, 10, and 15 with integer coefficients. In other words, we need to find the largest number x such that there are no integers a, b, and c satisfying the equation 6a + 10b + 15c = x.\n\nStep 3: \nWe can use the Chicken McNugget Theorem, which states that for any two relatively prime numbers m and n, the greatest number that cannot be written in the form am + bn (with integers a and b) is mn - m - n. However, in this case, we have three coins, so we need to extend this theorem to three variables.\n\nStep 4: \nTo extend the Chicken McNugget Theorem to three variables, we can use the following approach. First, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three coin values, which is gcd(6, 10, 15). Then, we can use the formula (m1*m2*m3 - m1*m2 - m1*m3 - m2*m3 + m1 + m2 + m3) / gcd(m1, m2, m3), where m1, m2, and m3 are the coin values.\n\nStep 5: \nFirst, let's calculate the GCD of 6, 10, and 15. The GCD of 6 and 10 is 2. Then, the GCD of 2 and 15 is 1. So, the GCD of 6, 10, and 15 is 1.\n\nStep 6: \nNow, we can plug the values into the formula: (6*10*15 - 6*10 - 6*15 - 10*15 + 6 + 10 + 15) / 1 = (900 - 60 - 90 - 150 + 31) / 1 = 631.\n\nStep 7: \nTherefore, the largest number that cannot be purchased with exact change is 631. The sum of the digits of 631 is 6 + 3 + 1 = 10.\n\nStep 8: \nSo, the final answer is the sum of the digits of 631, which is 10.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{10}",
  "Step 1:  The problem describes a triangle $ABC$ with side lengths in arithmetic progression, where the smallest side has a length of $6.$ We are also given that the triangle has an angle of $120^\\circ.$ Our goal is to find the area of triangle $ABC$ and then express it in the form $m \\sqrt{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers and $n$ is without square factors. Finally, we need to find $m+n$.\nStep 2:  First, let's recall that in an arithmetic progression, the side lengths are in the form $a-d, a, a+d$, where $a$ is the middle side and $d$ is the common difference. Since the smallest side is $6$, the sides are $6, 6+d, 6+2d$. Therefore, the sides are $6, 6+d, 6+2d$.\nStep 3:  We know that the triangle has an angle of $120^\\circ$. Let's denote the angle opposite the side of length $6$ as $120^\\circ$. Then, the other two angles are $30^\\circ$ and $30^\\circ$ because the sum of angles in a triangle is $180^\\circ$. Therefore, the triangle is a $30-60-120$ triangle.\nStep 4:  In a $30-60-120$ triangle, the sides are in the ratio $1:\\sqrt{3}:2$. Therefore, the sides are $6, 6\\sqrt{3}, 12$. So, the sides are $6, 6\\sqrt{3}, 12$.\nStep 5:  Alternatively, we can use the Law of Cosines to find the sides. Let's denote the sides as $a=6, b=6+d, c=6+2d$. Then, we have the Law of Cosines equation: $c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\\cos(C)$. Here, $C=120^\\circ$. Therefore, $c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\\cos(120^\\circ)$. Substituting the values, we get $c^2 = 6^2 + (6+d)^2 - 2(6)(6+d)\\cos(120^\\circ)$. Simplifying this equation will give us the value of $d$.\nStep 6:  Alternatively, we can use the Law of Sines to find the sides. Let's denote the sides as $a=6, b=6+d, c=6+2d$. Then, we have the Law of Sines equation: $\\frac{a}{\\sin(A)} = \\frac{b}{\\sin(B)} = \\frac{c}{\\sin(C)}$. Here, $A=30^\\circ, B=60^\\circ, C=120^\\circ$. Therefore, $\\frac{6}{\\sin(30^\\circ)} = \\frac{6+d}{\\sin(60^\\circ)} = \\frac{6+2d}{\\sin(120^\\circ)}$. Solving this equation will give us the value of $d$.\nStep 7:  Let's solve the equation using the Law of Sines. We have $\\frac{6}{\\sin(30^\\circ)} = \\frac{6+d}{\\sin(60^\\circ)} = \\frac{6+2d}{\\sin(120^\\circ)}$.

  "Step 1: First, let's denote the original price of the shoes as \\(x\\). Since the running shoes were on sale with a 20% discount, the discounted price would be 80% of the original price, which is \\(0.8x\\). Then, Carlos has to pay a 7.5% sales tax on this discounted price. So, the total amount he has to pay is the discounted price plus the sales tax, which is \\(0.8x + 0.075(0.8x)\\). We know that Carlos had $43, so the total amount he pays must be equal to or less than $43. Therefore, we can set up the inequality \\(0.8x + 0.075(0.8x) \\leq 43\\). Step 2: To solve the inequality, first, we need to simplify the left-hand side. The sales tax is 7.5% of the discounted price, which is 0.075 times 0.8x. So, the total amount is \\(0.8x + 0.075(0.8x) = 0.8x + 0.06x = 0.86x\\). Therefore, the inequality is \\(0.86x \\leq 43\\). Step 3: To find the maximum value of x, we need to solve the equation \\(0.86x = 43\\). Dividing both sides by 0.86 gives \\(x = \\frac{43}{0.86}\\). Step 4: Calculate the value of x. \\(x = \\frac{43}{0.86} = 50\\). Therefore, the original price of the most expensive shoes Carlos could afford to buy is $50. Step 5: Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{50}",
  "Step 1: The problem states that when n standard six-sided dice are rolled, the product of the numbers rolled can be any of 936 possible values. We need to find the value of n.\n\nStep 2: To approach this problem, we can consider the possible outcomes when rolling n dice. Each die can have 6 possible outcomes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6). Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes for n dice is 6^n.\n\nStep 3: However, the problem mentions that the product of the numbers rolled can be any of 936 possible values. This means that the product of the numbers rolled can range from 1 (when all dice show 1) to 6^n (when all dice show 6). But since the product can be any of 936 possible values, we need to find the value of n such that there are 936 possible products.\n\nStep 4: Let's consider the possible products when rolling n dice. The product can be any number from 1 to 6^n. However, not all numbers in this range are possible products.

  "Step 1: Problem Explanation\nWe are given positive integers $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ that satisfy several relations involving their least common multiples (LCM) and greatest common divisor (GCD). We need to find the GCD of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$.\n\nStep 2: \nTo find the GCD of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$, we can use the fact that the GCD of a set of numbers is equal to the product of the common prime factors raised to the smallest power among all numbers. Since the LCM of two numbers is equal to the product of the two numbers divided by their GCD, we can use the given LCMs to find the GCD.\n\nStep 3: \nFirst, let's find the GCD of $a$ and $b$. The LCM of $a$ and $b$ is given as $2^3\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 5^3$. Since the product of $a$ and $b$ is $2^6\\cdot 3^9\\cdot 5^7$, the GCD of $a$ and $b$ is the product of the common prime factors raised to the smallest power. Therefore, the GCD of $a$ and $b$ is $2^3\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 5^3$.\n\nSimilarly, the GCD of $a$ and $c$ is $2^3\\cdot 3^3\\cdot 5^3$, the GCD of $a$ and $d$ is $2^3\\cdot 3^3\\cdot 5^3$, the GCD of $b$ and $c$ is $2^1\\cdot 3^3\\cdot 5^2$, the GCD of $b$ and $d$ is $2^2\\cdot 3^3\\cdot 5^2$, and the GCD of $c$ and $d$ is $2^2\\cdot 3^3\\cdot 5^2$.\n\nStep 4: \nNow, we need to find the GCD of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$. Since the GCD of two numbers is the product of the common prime factors raised to the smallest power, we can find the GCD of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ by finding the product of the common prime factors raised to the smallest power among all numbers.\n\nStep 5: \nLet's find the common prime factors among $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$. The prime factors are 2, 3, and 5. The powers of 2 are 3, 1, 2, and 2 respectively. The powers of 3 are 2, 3, 3, and 3 respectively. The powers of 5 are 3, 3, 3, and 2 respectively.\n\nStep 6: \nThe smallest power of 2 among all numbers is 1. The smallest power of 3 among all numbers is 2.

The first triangle is a 3-4-5 right triangle inscribed in circle A, and the second triangle is a 5-12-13 right triangle inscribed in circle B. We need to find the ratio of the area of circle A to the area of circle B. The final answer should be in the form m/n, where m and n are relatively prime positive integers. We are asked to find m + n.\n\nStep 2: Outline the solution strategy\nTo solve this problem, we can use the fact that the hypotenuse of a right triangle inscribed in a circle is the diameter of the circle. Therefore, the radius of circle A is half the length of the hypotenuse of the 3-4-5 triangle, which is 5/2. Similarly, the radius of circle B is half the length of the hypotenuse of the 5-12-13 triangle, which is 13/2. We can then calculate the areas of both circles using the formula A = \u03c0r^2, where r is the radius. Finally, we can find the ratio of the areas and simplify it to the form m/n.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the radius of circle A\nThe hypotenuse of the 3-4-5 triangle is 5. Therefore, the radius of circle A is half of 5, which is 5/2.\n\n```python\nradius_A = 5 / 2\n```\n\nStep 4: Calculate the radius of circle B\nThe hypotenuse of the 5-12-13 triangle is 13. Therefore, the radius of circle B is half of 13, which is 13/2.\n\n```python\nradius_B = 13 / 2\n```\n\nStep 5: Calculate the areas of both circles\nThe area of a circle is given by A = \u03c0r^2. We can calculate the areas of both circles using this formula.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\narea_A = math.pi * (radius_A ** 2)\narea_B = math.pi * (radius_B ** 2)\n```\n\nStep 6: Find the ratio of the areas\nThe ratio of the areas is area_A / area_B. We can simplify this ratio to the form m/n.\n\n```python\nratio = area_A / area_B\n```\n\nStep 7: Simplify the ratio to the form m/n\nWe can simplify the ratio by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). We can use the math.gcd function in Python to find the GCD.\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ngcd = math.gcd(int(area_A / math.pi), int(area_B / math.pi))\nm = int(area_A / math.pi) // gcd\nn = int(area_B / math.pi) // gcd\n```\n\nStep 8: Find m + n\nFinally, we can find m + n.\n\n```python\nresult = m + n\n```\n\nNow, let's combine all the steps into a single function and execute it using the Python interpreter.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef solve_problem():\n    radius_A = 5 / 2\n    radius_B = 13 / 2\n\n    area_A = math.pi * (radius_A ** 2)\n    area_B = math.pi * (radius_B ** 2)\n\n    ratio = area_A / area_B\n\n    gcd = math.gcd(int(area_A / math.pi), int(area_B / math.pi))\n    m = int(area_A / math.pi) // gcd\n    n = int(area_B / math.pi) // gcd\n\n    result = m + n\n    return result\n\nresult = solve_problem()\nprint(\"The final answer is \\boxed{\" + str(result) + \"}.",
  "Step 1: First, let's understand the problem. Jackson has a paintbrush that creates a strip with a width of 6.5 millimeters. He has enough paint to make a strip 25 meters long. We need to find out how many square centimeters of paper he could cover with paint.\n\nStep 2: To find the area that Jackson can cover, we need to calculate the area of the strip. The area of a strip is given by the formula: Area = Length \u00d7 Width. However, the length is given in meters, and the width is given in millimeters. So, we need to convert the length from meters to millimeters first.\n\nStep 3: To convert meters to millimeters, we know that 1 meter = 1000 millimeters. Therefore, 25 meters = 25 \u00d7 1000 = 25,000 millimeters.\n\nStep 4: Now that we have the length in millimeters, we can calculate the area. The width is 6.5 millimeters. So, the area is 25,000 mm \u00d7 6.5 mm.\n\nStep 5: Multiplying the length and width gives us the area in square millimeters. Therefore, the area is 25,000 \u00d7 6.5 = 162,500 square millimeters.\n\nStep 6: However, the question asks for the area in square centimeters. Since 1 centimeter = 10 millimeters, 1 square centimeter = 10 mm \u00d7 10 mm = 100 square millimeters. Therefore, to convert square millimeters to square centimeters, we divide by 100.\n\nStep 7: So, to convert 162,500 square millimeters to square centimeters, we divide by 100: 162,500 \u00f7 100 = 1,625 square centimeters.\n\nStep 8: Therefore, Jackson can cover 1,625 square centimeters of paper with paint.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{1625}",
  "Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem is about a game where a $2 \\times 1$ rectangle is placed on a $3 \\times 3$ grid of squares, but the exact position of the rectangle is unknown. The goal is to find at least one square that is covered by the rectangle using the minimum number of turns. In each turn, a square is guessed, and the response is whether that square is covered by the rectangle.\n\nStep 2: Determine the total number of squares in the grid\nThe grid is $3 \\times 3$, so there are $3 \\times 3 = 9$ squares in total.\n\nStep 3: Consider the possible positions of the rectangle\nThe rectangle is $2 \\times 1$, so it can be placed in two possible orientations: horizontally or vertically. If placed horizontally, it covers two adjacent squares in a row. If placed vertically, it covers two adjacent squares in a column. Since the rectangle is $2 \\times 1$, it can be placed in any of the 6 horizontal or vertical pairs of adjacent squares.\n\nStep 4: Determine the minimum number of turns needed\nTo find the minimum number of turns, we need to consider the worst-case scenario where the rectangle is placed in a way that makes it difficult to guess a covered square. Let's analyze the possible positions of the rectangle and the corresponding number of turns needed to guarantee finding a covered square.\n\nStep 5: Analyze the worst-case scenario\nThe worst-case scenario would be when the rectangle is placed in a way that covers two squares that are not adjacent to each other. This would make it difficult to guess a covered square in the first few turns. Let's consider the possible positions of the rectangle:\n\n- If the rectangle is placed horizontally, it covers two squares in a row. For example, if it covers squares (1,1) and (1,2), or (2,1) and (2,2), or (3,1) and (3,2). In each case, the two covered squares are adjacent horizontally.\n\n- If the rectangle is placed vertically, it covers two squares in a column. For example, if it covers squares (1,1) and (2,1), or (1,2) and (2,2), or (1,3) and (2,3). In each case, the two covered squares are adjacent vertically.\n\nIn all cases, the two covered squares are adjacent either horizontally or vertically. Therefore, if the rectangle is placed in a way that covers two non-adjacent squares, it would be difficult to guess a covered square in the first few turns.\n\nStep 6: Determine the minimum number of turns needed\nTo guarantee finding a covered square, we need to consider the worst-case scenario where the rectangle is placed in a way that covers two non-adjacent squares. Let's analyze the possible positions of the rectangle:\n\n- If the rectangle is placed horizontally, it covers two squares in a row. For example, if it covers squares (1,1) and (1,2), or (2,1) and (2,2), or (3,1) and (3,2). In each case, the two covered squares are adjacent horizontally.\n\n- If the rectangle is placed vertically, it covers two squares in a column. For example, if it covers squares (1,1) and (2,1), or (1,2) and (2,2), or (1,3) and (2,3). In each case, the two covered squares are adjacent vertically.\n\nIn all cases, the two covered squares are adjacent either horizontally or vertically. Therefore, if the rectangle is placed in a way that covers two non-adjacent squares, it would be difficult to guess a covered square in the first few turns.\n\nHowever, since the rectangle is $2 \\times 1$, it can only cover two squares. Therefore, if the rectangle is placed in a way that covers two non-adjacent squares, it would be impossible to place it on the grid. Therefore, the rectangle must be placed in a way that covers two adjacent squares.\n\nSince the rectangle is $2 \\times 1$, it can be placed in any of the 6 horizontal or vertical pairs of adjacent squares. Therefore, the worst-case scenario would be when the rectangle is placed in a way that covers two squares that are not adjacent to each other. However, as mentioned earlier, it is impossible to place the rectangle in a way that covers two non-adjacent squares. Therefore, the rectangle must be placed in a way that covers two adjacent squares.\n\nIn this case, the minimum number of turns needed to guarantee finding a covered square would be the number of turns needed to cover all possible positions of the rectangle. Since there are 6 possible positions (3 horizontal and 3 vertical), we need to consider the worst-case scenario where the rectangle is placed in each of these positions.\n\nHowever, since the rectangle is $2 \\times 1$, it can only cover two squares. Therefore, if the rectangle is placed in a way that covers two adjacent squares, the remaining squares are not covered. Therefore, if we guess a square that is not covered, we can eliminate that position. Therefore, the minimum number of turns needed would be the number of turns needed to eliminate all possible positions of the rectangle.\n\nSince there are 6 possible positions, we need to eliminate each position. Therefore, the minimum number of turns needed would be 6.\n\nHowever, since we are guessing squares, each turn gives us information about whether the guessed square is covered or not. Therefore, each turn eliminates one possible position. Therefore, the minimum number of turns needed would be the number of turns needed to eliminate all possible positions.\n\nSince there are 6 possible positions, we need to eliminate each position. Therefore, the minimum number of turns needed would be 6.\n\nHowever, since we are guessing squares, each turn gives us information about whether the guessed square is covered or not.

  "To solve this problem, we need to understand the behavior of the polynomial \\(P(x)\\) on the intervals between its roots. The polynomial is given by the product of linear factors \\((x-1)^1 (x-2)^2 (x-3)^3 \\cdot \\cdot \\cdot (x-10)^{10}\\). Each factor \\((x-k)^n\\) contributes a root at \\(x=k\\) with multiplicity \\(n\\). The total number of roots is the sum of the multiplicities, which is \\(1+2+3+\\cdots+10 = \\frac{10(10+1)}{2} = 55\\). Therefore, the polynomial has 55 roots, and the remaining intervals are 11 disjoint open intervals.\n\nTo determine on how many of these intervals \\(P(x)\\) is positive, we need to consider the sign of the polynomial on each interval. Since the polynomial is a product of linear factors, its sign on an interval is determined by the signs of the factors on that interval.\n\nLet's consider an interval \\((a,b)\\) between two consecutive roots \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The polynomial \\(P(x)\\) can be written as:\n\n\\[P(x) = (x-a)^{m_a} (x-b)^{m_b} \\cdot \\cdot \\cdot (x-10)^{10}\\]\n\nwhere \\(m_a\\) and \\(m_b\\) are the multiplicities of the roots at \\(x=a\\) and \\(x=b\\), respectively. Since the polynomial is a product of linear factors, the sign of \\(P(x)\\) on the interval \\((a,b)\\) is determined by the signs of the factors \\((x-a)^{m_a}\\) and \\((x-b)^{m_b}\\).\n\nSince the interval \\((a,b)\\) is open, the endpoints \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are not included. Therefore, the sign of \\(P(x)\\) on \\((a,b)\\) is determined by the signs of the factors \\((x-a)^{m_a}\\) and \\((x-b)^{m_b}\\) for \\(x\\) in \\((a,b)\\).\n\nLet's consider the signs of the factors:\n\n* For \\((x-a)^{m_a}\\), when \\(x\\) is in \\((a,b)\\), \\(x-a\\) is positive, so \\((x-a)^{m_a}\\) is positive if \\(m_a\\) is even and negative if \\(m_a\\) is odd.\n* For \\((x-b)^{m_b}\\), when \\(x\\) is in \\((a,b)\\), \\(x-b\\) is negative, so \\((x-b)^{m_b}\\) is positive if \\(m_b\\) is even and negative if \\(m_b\\) is odd.\n\nTherefore, the sign of \\(P(x)\\) on the interval \\((a,b)\\) is positive if both factors have the same sign (either both positive or both negative) and negative if they have opposite signs.\n\nSince the polynomial is a product of linear factors, the sign of \\(P(x)\\) on an interval is determined by the signs of the factors. Therefore, the sign of \\(P(x)\\) on each interval \\((a,b)\\) is determined by the signs of the factors \\((x-a)^{m_a}\\) and \\((x-b)^{m_b}\\).\n\nLet's analyze the signs of the factors for each interval:\n\n1. Interval \\((1,2)\\): \\(m_1=1\\) (odd), \\(m_2=2\\) (even). Therefore, \\((x-1)^1\\) is negative, and \\((x-2)^2\\) is positive. So, \\(P(x)\\) is negative on \\((1,2)\\).\n2. Interval \\((2,3)\\): \\(m_2=2\\) (even), \\(m_3=3\\) (odd). Therefore, \\((x-2)^2\\) is positive, and \\((x-3)^3\\) is negative. So, \\(P(x)\\) is negative on \\((2,3)\\).\n3. Interval \\((3,4)\\): \\(m_3=3\\) (odd), \\(m_4=4\\) (even). Therefore, \\((x-3)^3\\) is negative, and \\((x-4)^4\\) is positive. So, \\(P(x)\\) is positive on \\((3,4)\\).\n4. Interval \\((4,5)\\): \\(m_4=4\\) (even), \\(m_5=5\\) (odd). Therefore, \\((x-4)^4\\) is positive, and \\((x-5)^5\\) is negative. So, \\(P(x)\\) is negative on \\((4,5)\\).\n5. Interval \\((5,6)\\): \\(m_5=5\\) (odd), \\(m_6=6\\) (even). Therefore, \\((x-5)^5\\) is negative, and \\((x-6)^6\\) is positive. So, \\(P(x)\\) is positive on \\((5,6)\\).\n6. Interval \\((6,7)\\): \\(m_6=6\\) (even), \\(m_7=7\\) (odd). Therefore, \\((x-6)^6\\) is positive, and \\((x-7)^7\\) is negative. So, \\(P(x)\\) is negative on \\((6,7)\\).\n7. Interval \\((7,8)\\): \\(m_7=7\\) (odd), \\(m_8=8\\) (even). Therefore, \\((x-7)^7\\) is negative, and \\((x-8)^8\\) is positive. So, \\(P(x)\\) is positive on \\((7,8)\\).\n8. Interval \\((8,9)\\): \\(m_8=8\\) (even), \\(m_9=9\\) (odd). Therefore, \\((x-8)^8\\) is positive, and \\((x-9)^9\\) is negative. So, \\(P(x)\\) is negative on \\((8,9)\\).\n9. Interval \\((9,10)\\): \\(m_9=9\\) (odd), \\(m_{10}=10\\) (even). Therefore, \\((x-9)^9\\) is negative, and \\((x-10)^{10}\\) is positive. So, \\(P(x)\\) is positive on \\((9,10)\\).\n\nTherefore, the polynomial \\(P(x)\\) is positive on the intervals \\((3,4)\\), \\((5,6)\\), \\((7,8)\\), and \\((9,10)\\). Therefore, the number of intervals where \\(P(x)\\) is positive is 4.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{4}",
  "Step 1: To determine for how many integers $n$ the given expression represents a real number, we need to analyze the expression step by step. The expression involves logarithms and a square root, so we need to ensure that the arguments of the logarithms and the square root are valid.\n\nStep 2: First, let's examine the expression inside the square root: \\[\\frac{\\log (n^2) - (\\log n)^2}{\\log n - 3}.\\]For this expression to be real, the denominator must be nonzero, and the numerator must be nonnegative.\n\nStep 3: The denominator is \\[\\log n - 3.\\]For the denominator to be nonzero, we must have \\[\\log n - 3 \\neq 0.\\]Solving this inequality, we get \\[\\log n \\neq 3.\\]Since \\[\\log n\\]is the base 10 logarithm, \\[\\log n = 3\\]implies \\[10^3 = n,\\]which means \\[n = 1000.\\]Therefore, the denominator is nonzero for all integers \\[n \\neq 1000.\\]\n\nStep 4: Now, let's consider the numerator: \\[\\log (n^2) - (\\log n)^2.\\]For the numerator to be nonnegative, we need \\[\\log (n^2) - (\\log n)^2 \\geq 0.\\]Let's simplify this expression.\n\nStep 5: Using the property of logarithms that \\[\\log (a^b) = b \\log a,\\]we can rewrite \\[\\log (n^2)\\]as \\[2 \\log n.\\]Therefore, the numerator becomes \\[2 \\log n - (\\log n)^2.\\]Let's denote \\[\\log n = x.\\]Then, the numerator is \\[2x - x^2.\\]We need \\[2x - x^2 \\geq 0.\\]Factoring the quadratic expression, we get \\[x(2 - x) \\geq 0.\\]Therefore, the numerator is nonnegative if \\[x \\leq 0\\]or \\[x \\geq 2.\\]\n\nStep 6: Since \\[\\log n = x,\\]the condition \\[x \\leq 0\\]implies \\[\\log n \\leq 0,\\]which means \\[n \\leq 1.\\]Similarly, the condition \\[x \\geq 2\\]implies \\[\\log n \\geq 2,\\]which means \\[n \\geq 10^2 = 100.\\]Therefore, the numerator is nonnegative for \\[n \\leq 1\\]or \\[n \\geq 100.\\]\n\nStep 7: However, we also need to consider the case where the denominator is zero, which occurs when \\[\\log n = 3,\\]i.e., \\[n = 1000.\\]In this case, the numerator is \\[2 \\log 1000 - (\\log 1000)^2.\\]Let's compute this value.\n\nStep 8: Since \\[\\log 1000 = 3,\\]the numerator becomes \\[2 \\cdot 3 - 3^2 = 6 - 9 = -3.\\]Therefore, when \\[n = 1000,\\]the numerator is negative, so the expression is undefined at \\[n = 1000.\\]\n\nStep 9: Therefore, the expression is real for all integers \\[n \\leq 1\\]or \\[n \\geq 100.\\]However, we need to exclude \\[n = 1000.\\]So, the expression is real for \\[n \\leq 1\\]or \\[n \\geq 100\\]and \\[n \\neq 1000.\\]\n\nStep 10: Therefore, the number of integers \\[n\\]for which the expression is real is the number of integers in the intervals \\[(-\\infty, 1]\\]and \\[[100, 1000).\\]The first interval contains 1 integer, and the second interval contains 900 integers. Therefore, the total number of integers is \\[1 + 900 = 901.\\]\n\nStep 11: Therefore, the expression is real for 901 integers.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{901}",
  "Problem: How many nonempty subsets $B$ of ${0, 1, 2, 3, \\cdots, 12}$ have the property that the number of elements in $B$ is equal to the least element of $B$? For example, $B = {4, 6, 8, 11}$ satisfies the condition.\n\nStep 1: Understand the problem\nWe need to find the number of nonempty subsets B of the set {0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 12} such that the number of elements in B is equal to the least element of B.\n\nStep 2: Break down the problem\nTo solve this problem, we can consider each possible least element from 1 to 12 (since 0 cannot be the least element of a nonempty subset) and count the number of subsets that satisfy the condition for each least element.\n\nStep 3: Count subsets for each least element\nFor each least element k from 1 to 12, we need to find the number of subsets B such that |B| = k and the least element of B is k. This means that B must contain exactly k elements, and the smallest element in B is k.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the number of subsets for each k\nFor each k, the number of subsets B with |B| = k and least element k is equivalent to choosing k elements from the remaining elements in the set {0, 1, 2, ..., 12} excluding k. However, since k is the least element, the remaining elements must be greater than or equal to k. Therefore, we need to choose k elements from the set {k, k+1, k+2, ..., 12}.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the number of subsets for each k\nFor each k, the number of subsets B with |B| = k and least element k is the number of combinations of k elements from the set {k, k+1, k+2, ..., 12}. This can be calculated using the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of elements in the set {k, k+1, k+2, ..., 12} and k is the number of elements to choose.\n\nStep 6: Calculate the total number of subsets\nTo find the total number of subsets B that satisfy the condition, we need to sum the number of subsets for each k from 1 to 12.\n\nStep 7: Compute the total number of subsets\nLet's compute the number of subsets for each k and sum them up.\n\nFor k = 1: The set is {1, 2, 3, ..., 12}. The number of subsets with 1 element is C(12, 1) = 12.\n\nFor k = 2: The set is {2, 3, 4, ..., 12}. The number of subsets with 2 elements is C(11, 2) = 55.\n\nFor k = 3: The set is {3, 4, 5, ..., 12}. The number of subsets with 3 elements is C(10, 3) = 120.\n\nFor k = 4: The set is {4, 5, 6, ..., 12}. The number of subsets with 4 elements is C(9, 4) = 126.\n\nFor k = 5: The set is {5, 6, 7, ..., 12}. The number of subsets with 5 elements is C(8, 5) = 56.\n\nFor k = 6: The set is {6, 7, 8, ..., 12}. The number of subsets with 6 elements is C(7, 6) = 7.\n\nFor k = 7: The set is {7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12}. The number of subsets with 6 elements is C(6, 6) = 1.\n\nFor k = 8: The set is {8, 9, 10, 11, 12}. The number of subsets with 5 elements is C(5, 5) = 1.\n\nFor k = 9: The set is {9, 10, 11, 12}. The number of subsets with 4 elements is C(4, 4) = 1.\n\nFor k = 10: The set is {10, 11, 12}. The number of subsets with 3 elements is C(3, 3) = 1.\n\nFor k = 11: The set is {11, 12}. The number of subsets with 2 elements is C(2, 2) = 1.\n\nFor k = 12: The set is {12}. The number of subsets with 1 element is C(1, 1) = 1.\n\nStep 8: Sum the number of subsets for each k\nThe total number of subsets is the sum of the number of subsets for each k from 1 to 12.\n\nTotal = 12 + 55 + 120 + 126 + 56 + 7 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 440.\n\nTherefore, the total number of nonempty subsets B of {0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 12} such that the number of elements in B is equal to the least element of B is 440.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{440}",
  "Step 1:  The problem asks us to find the area of the region in the coordinate plane defined by the inequality $| | x | - 1 | + | | y | - 1 | \\le 1$. To tackle this, we need to understand the geometric shape described by this inequality.\nStep 2:  The given inequality involves absolute values, so we need to consider different cases based on the signs of $x$ and $y$. Let's start by analyzing the inequality $| | x | - 1 | + | | y | - 1 | \\le 1$.\nStep 3:  First, we can consider the case when $x \\ge 0$ and $y \\ge 0$. In this case, the inequality becomes $|x - 1| + |y - 1| \\le 1$. This can be broken down into four regions based on the signs of $x - 1$ and $y - 1$. Let's analyze each region separately.\nStep 4:  When $x \\ge 1$ and $y \\ge 1$, the inequality becomes $(x - 1) + (y - 1) \\le 1$, which simplifies to $x + y \\le 3$. This is the region in the first quadrant bounded by the line $x + y = 3$. The area of this region is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 2$.\nStep 5:  When $x \\ge 1$ and $y < 1$, the inequality becomes $(x - 1) + (1 - y) \\le 1$, which simplifies to $x - y \\le 1$. This is the region in the first quadrant bounded by the line $x - y = 1$. The area of this region is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\nStep 6:  When $x < 1$ and $y \\ge 1$, the inequality becomes $(-x + 1) + (y - 1) \\le 1$, which simplifies to $y - x \\le 1$. This is the region in the first quadrant bounded by the line $y - x = 1$. The area of this region is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nStep 7:  When $x < 1$ and $y < 1$, the inequality becomes $(-x + 1) + (-y + 1) \\le 1$, which simplifies to $-x - y \\le 1$. This is the region in the first quadrant bounded by the line $-x - y = 1$. The area of this region is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nStep 8:  Adding up the areas of these four regions, we get $2 + 1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 4$. Therefore, the total area of the region in the first quadrant is $4$.\nStep 9:  Similarly, we can analyze the regions in the second, third, and fourth quadrants. Due to symmetry, the areas in the second, third, and fourth quadrants are the same as the first quadrant. Therefore, the total area of the entire region is $4 \\cdot 4 = 16$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the area of the region defined by the inequality $| | x | - 1 | + | | y | - 1 | \\le 1$ is $16$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{16}$"
