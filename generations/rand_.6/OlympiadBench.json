  "## Step 1: Understand the problem statement\nThe problem asks us to find all positive integers $n$ such that for any monic polynomial $P$ of degree at most $n$ with integer coefficients, there exists a positive integer $k \\leq n$ and $k+1$ distinct integers $x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_{k+1}$ satisfying the equation $P(x_1) + P(x_2) + \\cdots + P(x_k) = P(x_{k+1})$.\n\n## Step 2: Consider the properties of monic polynomials\nA monic polynomial is a polynomial with the leading coefficient equal to 1. This means that the polynomial can be written in the form $P(x) = x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_1x + a_0$, where $a_i$ are integers.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the given equation\nThe equation $P(x_1) + P(x_2) + \\cdots + P(x_k) = P(x_{k+1})$ suggests that the sum of the values of the polynomial at $k$ distinct points is equal to the value of the polynomial at another distinct point.\n\n## Step 4: Consider the degree of the polynomial\nThe degree of the polynomial $P$ is at most $n$. This means that the highest power of $x$ in the polynomial is $n$.\n\n## Step 5: Use the properties of polynomials to derive a condition\nSince the degree of the polynomial is at most $n$, we can use the fact that a polynomial of degree $n$ has at most $n$ distinct roots. This means that if we have $k+1$ distinct points $x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_{k+1}$, then the polynomial $P$ must have at least $k+1$ distinct roots.\n\n## Step 6: Derive a condition for the existence of $k+1$ distinct roots\nFor the polynomial $P$ to have at least $k+1$ distinct roots, we must have $k+1 \\leq n$. This is because the degree of the polynomial is at most $n$, and a polynomial of degree $n$ can have at most $n$ distinct roots.\n\n## Step 7: Determine the possible values of $n$\nFrom the condition $k+1 \\leq n$, we can see that $n$ must be at least $k+1$ for any given $k$. This means that $n$ can take on any value greater than or equal to $k+1$ for any given $k$.\n\n## Step 8: Consider the smallest possible value of $n$\nThe smallest possible value of $n$ is $n=1$, since we can have $k=0$ and $k+1=1$.\n\n## Step 9: Consider the largest possible value of $n$\nThere is no largest possible value of $n$, since $n$ can take on any value greater than or equal to $k+1$ for any given $k$.\n\n## Step 10: Determine the final answer\nBased on the analysis above, we can see that the possible values of $n$ are all positive integers greater than or equal to $k+1$ for any given $k$. Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{1}",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of a tight collection of subsets and how it relates to the cardinality of the collection.\nStep 2:  A tight collection of subsets is defined as a non-empty collection of subsets $A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{k}$ of $X$ such that the union $A_{1} \\cup \\cdots \\cup A_{k}$ is a proper subset of $X$ and no element of $X$ lies in exactly one of the $A_{i}$s.\nStep 3:  We are asked to find the largest cardinality of a collection of proper non-empty subsets of $X$, no non-empty subcollection of which is tight.\nStep 4:  To approach this problem, we can start by considering the properties of a tight collection and how it can be constructed.\nStep 5:  We can then use these properties to derive a condition for a collection of subsets to be tight, and use this condition to find the largest cardinality of a collection that satisfies the given conditions.\nStep 6:  By analyzing the properties of a tight collection and using them to derive a condition for a collection to be tight, we can find the largest cardinality of a collection of proper non-empty subsets of $X$ that satisfies the given conditions.\nStep 7:  This will involve

collection of subsets to be tight.\nStep 12:  If a collection of subsets is tight, then for any element $x$ in $X$, there must be at least two subsets in the collection that contain $x$.\nStep 13:  This is because if there is an element $x$ that lies in exactly one of the $A_{i}$s, then the collection is not tight.\nStep 14:  Therefore, for a collection of subsets to be tight, every element in

$X$ and including it in two subsets $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$.\nStep 17:  We can then select another element $y$ from $X$ and include it in $A_{1}$ and $A_{3}$.\nStep 18:  We can continue this process, selecting elements from $X$ and including them in subsets in such a way that every element lies in at least two subsets.\nStep 19:  By following this process, we can construct a tight collection of subsets.\n\nStep 20:  Now, let's consider the condition for a collection of subsets to be tight.\nStep 21:  A collection of subsets is tight if and only if every element in $X$ lies in at least two of

This means that for any $n \\geq 15$, we can find a pair of distinct elements in the same subset that sum to $n$.\nNext, we consider the case where $n$ is a multiple of $3$. In this case, we can find two distinct elements $a$ and $b$ in the same subset $A_{i}$ such that $a + b = n$. Since $n$ is a multiple of $3$, we can write $n = 3m$ for some integer $m$. Then, we can choose $a = m$ and $b = 2m$, which are both in the same subset $A_{i}$ and satisfy $a + b = n$.\nNow, we need to find the greatest positive integer $k$ such that the set of positive integers can be partitioned into $k$ subsets $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{k}$ satisfying the given condition. We can start by considering the case where $k = 2$.\nIf $k = 2$, then we can partition the set of positive integers into two subsets $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$. We can choose $A_{1}$ to contain all the odd positive integers and $A_{2}$ to contain all the even positive integers. Then, for any $n \\geq 15$, we can find two distinct elements $a$ and $b$ in the same subset $A_{i}$ such that $a + b = n$. For example, if $n$ is odd, we can choose $a = \\frac{n+1}{2}$ and $b = \\frac{n-1}{2}$, which are both in $A_{1}$ and satisfy $a + b = n$.\nHowever, we can also consider the case where $k = 4$. If $k = 4$, then we can partition the set of positive integers into four subsets $A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3},$ and $A_{4}$. We can choose $A_{1}$ to contain all the positive integers congruent to $1$ modulo $4$, $A_{2}$ to contain all the positive integers congruent to $2$ modulo $4$, $A_{3}$ to contain all the positive integers congruent to $3$ modulo $4$, and $A_{4}$ to contain all the positive integers congruent to $0$ modulo $4$. Then, for any $n \\geq 15$, we can find two distinct elements $a$ and $b$ in the same subset $A_{i}$ such that $a + b = n$. For example, if $n$ is congruent to $1$ modulo $4$, we can choose $a = \\frac{n+3}{4}$ and $b = \\frac{n-1}{4}$, which are both in $A_{1}$ and satisfy $a + b = n$.\nWe can continue this process and consider the case where $k = 5$.

  "## Step 1: Understand the given problem\nWe are given 100 nonnegative real numbers $x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{100}$ such that the sum of any three consecutive numbers is less than or equal to 1. We need to find the maximal possible value of the sum $S=\\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i} x_{i+2}$.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the constraints\nThe given constraint is $x_{i}+x_{i+1}+x_{i+2} \\leq 1$ for all $i=1, \\ldots, 100$. This constraint will be used to derive an upper bound for the sum $S$.\n\n## Step 3: Derive an upper bound for the sum $S$\nWe can rewrite the constraint as $x_{i+2} \\leq 1 - x_{i} - x_{i+1}$. Multiplying both sides by $x_{i}$, we get $x_{i}x_{i+2} \\leq x_{i} - x_{i}^2 - x_{i}x_{i+1}$. Similarly, multiplying both sides by $x_{i+1}$, we get $x_{i+1}x_{i+2} \\leq x_{i+1} - x_{i+1}^2 - x_{i+1}x_{i+2}$.\n\n## Step 4: Combine the inequalities\nAdding the two inequalities, we get $x_{i}x_{i+2} + x_{i+1}x_{i+2} \\leq x_{i} + x_{i+1} - x_{i}^2 - x_{i+1}^2$. Rearranging the terms, we get $x_{i}x_{i+2} + x_{i+1}x_{i+2} \\leq x_{i} + x_{i+1} - (x_{i}^2 + x_{i+1}^2)$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the expression\nWe can rewrite the expression as $x_{i}x_{i+2} + x_{i+1}x_{i+2} \\leq x_{i} + x_{i+1} - (x_{i}^2 + x_{i+1}^2) = (x_{i} + x_{i+1}) - (x_{i}^2 + x_{i+1}^2) = - (x_{i} - \\frac{1}{2})^2 - (x_{i+1} - \\frac{1}{2})^2 + \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n## Step 6: Sum the inequalities\nSumming the inequalities over $i=1, \\ldots, 100$, we get $\\sum_{i=1}^{100} (x_{i}x_{i+2} + x_{i+1}x_{i+2}) \\leq \\sum_{i=1}^{100} \\left( - (x_{i} - \\frac{1}{2})^2 - (x_{i+1} - \\frac{1}{2})^2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\right)$.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the sum\nSimplifying the sum, we get $\\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i}x_{i+2} + \\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i+1}x_{i+2} \\leq \\sum_{i=1}^{100} \\left( - (x_{i} - \\frac{1}{2})^2 - (x_{i+1} - \\frac{1}{2})^2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\right)$.\n\n## Step 8: Use the constraint to simplify the sum\nUsing the constraint $x_{i}+x_{i+1}+x_{i+2} \\leq 1$, we can rewrite the sum as $\\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i}x_{i+2} + \\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i+1}x_{i+2} \\leq \\sum_{i=1}^{100} \\left( - (x_{i} - \\frac{1}{2})^2 - (x_{i+1} - \\frac{1}{2})^2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{100} \\left( - (x_{i} - \\frac{1}{2})^2 \\right) + \\sum_{i=1}^{100} \\left( - (x_{i+1} - \\frac{1}{2})^2 \\right) + \\sum_{i=1}^{100} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)$.\n\n## Step 9: Simplify the sum\nSimplifying the sum, we get $\\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i}x_{i+2} + \\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i+1}x_{i+2} \\leq \\sum_{i=1}^{100} \\left( - (x_{i} - \\frac{1}{2})^2 \\right) + \\sum_{i=1}^{100} \\left( - (x_{i+1} - \\frac{1}{2})^2 \\right) + \\sum_{i=1}^{100} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) = - \\sum_{i=1}^{100} (x_{i} - \\frac{1}{2})^2 - \\sum_{i=1}^{100} (x_{i+1} - \\frac{1}{2})^2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 100$.\n\n## Step 10: Simplify the sum\nSimplifying the sum, we get $\\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i}x_{i+2} + \\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i+1}x_{i+2} \\leq - \\sum_{i=1}^{100} (x_{i} - \\frac{1}{2})^2 - \\sum_{i=1}^{100} (x_{i+1} - \\frac{1}{2})^2 + 50$.\n\n## Step 11: Simplify the sum\nSimplifying the sum, we get $\\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i}x_{i+2} + \\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i+1}x_{i+2} \\leq - \\sum_{i=1}^{100} (x_{i} - \\frac{1}{2})^2 - \\sum_{i=1}^{100} (x_{i+1} - \\frac{1}{2})^2 + 50 = - \\sum_{i=1}^{100} (x_{i} - \\frac{1}{2})^2 - \\sum_{i=2}^{101} (x_{i} - \\frac{1}{2})^2 + 50$.\n\n## Step 12: Simplify the sum\nSimplifying the sum, we get $\\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i}x_{i+2} + \\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i+1}x_{i+2} \\leq - \\sum_{i=1}^{100} (x_{i} - \\frac{1}{2})^2 - \\sum_{i=2}^{101} (x_{i} - \\frac{1}{2})^2 + 50 = - \\sum_{i=1}^{100} (x_{i} - \\frac{1}{2})^2 - \\sum_{i=1}^{100} (x_{i+1} - \\frac{1}{2})^2 + 50$.\n\n## Step 13: Simplify the sum\nSimplifying the sum, we get $\\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i}x_{i+2} + \\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i+1}x_{i+2} \\leq - \\sum_{i=1}^{100} (x_{i} - \\frac{1}{2})^2 - \\sum_{i=1}^{100} (x_{i+1} - \\frac{1}{2})^2 + 50 = - \\sum_{i=1}^{100} (x_{i} - \\frac{1}{2})^2 - \\sum_{i=1}^{100} (x_{i} - \\frac{1}{2})^2 + 50$.\n\n## Step 14: Simplify the sum\nSimplifying the sum, we get $\\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i}x_{i+2} + \\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i+1}x_{i+2} \\leq - 2 \\sum_{i=1}^{100} (x",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find all functions $f: \\mathbb{Q}^{+} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Q}^{+}$ that satisfy the given functional equation for all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{Q}^{+}$.\nStep 2:  We start by setting $y = \\frac{1}{x}$ in the given functional equation. This gives us $f\\left(f(x)^{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{x}\\right) = x^{3} f\\left(x \\cdot \\frac{1}{x}\\right)$.\nStep 3:  Simplifying, we get $f\\left(\\frac{f(x)^{2}}{x}\\right) = x^{3} f(1)$.\nStep 4:  Now, we set $x = 1$ in the original functional equation to obtain $f(f(1)^{2} y) = f(y)$ for all $y \\in \\mathbb{Q}^{+}$.\nStep 5:  This implies that $f\\left(\\frac{f(1)^{2}}{x}\\right) = \\frac{f(1)^{3}}{x}$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{Q}^{+}$.\nStep 6:  Therefore, we have $f(1) = \\frac{f(1)^{3}}{x}$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{Q}^{+}$.\nStep 7:  This leads to the conclusion that $f(1) = 1$.\nStep 8:  Substituting $f(1) = 1$ back into the equation $f\\left(\\frac{f(1)^{2}}{x}\\right) = \\frac{f(1)^{3}}{x}$, we find that $f\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = \\frac{1}{x}$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{Q}^{+}$.\nStep 9:  Now, we set $y = \\frac{1}{x}$ in the original functional equation to obtain $f\\left(f(x)^{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{x}\\right) = x^{3} f\\left(x \\cdot \\frac{1}{x}\\right)$.\nStep 10:  Simplifying, we get $f\\left(\\frac{f(x)^{2}}{x}\\right) = x^{3} f(1)$.\nStep 11:  Since we have already established that $f(1) = 1$, we can conclude that $f\\left(\\frac{f(x)^{2}}{x}\\right) = x^{3}$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, we have $f(x) = x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{Q}^{+}$.\nStep 13:  Hence, the only function that satisfies the given functional equation is $f(x) = x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{Q}^{+}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",
  "Step 1:  The problem requires us to find the smallest positive integer $M$ such that among any $M$ distinct flags, there exist $N$ flags forming a diverse set. This means we need to determine the minimum number of flags required to guarantee that we can form an $N \\times N$ square with all fields on the main diagonal having the same color.\nStep 2:  To approach this problem, we can start by considering the total number of possible flags, which is $2^{N}$, as each country has a flag with $N$ fields, and each field can be either yellow or blue.\nStep 3:  We are given that no two countries have the same flag, so each flag is unique. This means that the total number of possible flags is $2^{N}$.\nStep 4:  Now, we need to find the smallest positive integer $M$ such that among any $M$ distinct flags, there exist $N$ flags forming a diverse set.\nStep 5:  To do this, we can consider the process of selecting flags one by one. We start with the first flag, and then for each subsequent flag, we check if it can be placed in the square such that the main diagonal has the same color.\nStep 6:  If we can place the flag, we move on to the next one. If we cannot place the flag, we remove the first flag and try to place the new one. This process continues until we have selected $M$ flags.\nStep 7:  The key insight here is that if we have selected $M$ flags and we cannot form a diverse set, then we must have selected at least $N$ flags that cannot be placed in the square.\nStep 8:  This means that the number of flags we have selected is at least $N$ more than the number of flags that can be placed in the square. Therefore, the smallest positive integer $M$ is $N + 1$.\nStep 9:  To confirm this, we can consider the case where $N = 4$. In this case, we have $2^{4} = 16$ possible flags. We can select $16$ flags and try to form a diverse set. If we cannot form a diverse set, then we must have selected at least $4$ flags that cannot be placed in the square.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the smallest positive integer $M$ is indeed $N + 1$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{N + 1}$",
  "## Step 1: Understand the constraints of the problem\nWe have a 100x100 chessboard and need to place 2500 chess kings on it. The constraints are that no two kings can be placed in squares sharing a common vertex, and each row and each column must contain exactly 25 kings.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the pattern of king placement\nTo satisfy the constraints, the kings must be placed in a specific pattern. Since each row and column must contain exactly 25 kings, the kings must be placed in a 25x25 grid within the 100x100 chessboard.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the possible positions for the kings\nGiven the constraints, the kings can only be placed in the squares of the 25x25 grid, and no two kings can be in the same row or column. This means that each king must be placed in a unique square within the grid.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of possible positions for the first king\nSince the first king can be placed in any of the 25x25 squares, there are 25*25 = 625 possible positions for the first king.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of possible positions for the remaining kings\nAfter placing the first king, the second king can be placed in any of the remaining 24x24 squares (since one row and one column are already occupied by the first king). This leaves 24*24 = 576 possible positions for the second king. Similarly, the third king can be placed in any of the remaining 23x23 squares, leaving 23*23 = 529 possible positions. This pattern continues until the 2500th king.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total number of possible arrangements\nTo find the total number of possible arrangements, we need to multiply the number of possible positions for each king. However, this would overcount the arrangements, since the order of placement does not matter. Therefore, we need to divide the product by the number of ways to arrange the 2500 kings, which is 2500!.\n\n## Step 7: Account for rotational and symmetry symmetries\nSince the problem considers two arrangements differing by rotation or symmetry as different, we need to divide the total number of arrangements by the number of possible rotations and symmetries. There are 8 possible rotations (0, 90, 180, 270 degrees) and 8 possible symmetries (reflection across the x-axis, y-axis, and 4 diagonals), resulting in a total of 8*8 = 64 possible transformations. However, this is an overcount, as some transformations are equivalent (e.g., rotation by 90 degrees followed by reflection across the x-axis is equivalent to rotation by 180 degrees). The correct number of distinct transformations is 8 (rotations) + 8 (reflections) - 4 (diagonal reflections) = 12.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the final number of arrangements\nThe final number of arrangements is the total number of possible arrangements divided by the number of distinct transformations. However, we need to correct the calculation from step 6. The correct calculation is to multiply the number of possible positions for each king, but we need to account for the fact that the first king can be placed in any of the 25x25 squares, and the remaining kings can be placed in the remaining squares. This can be represented as 25*24*23*...*1, which is the factorial of 25 (25!). However, we need to divide this by the number of ways to arrange the 25 rows and 25 columns, which is 25! * 25!. This is because each row and column must contain exactly 25 kings, and the order of the kings within each row and column does not matter.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the final number of arrangements\nThe final number of arrangements is 25! / (25! * 25!).

We can calculate this by counting the number of odd diagonals and using the fact that each odd diagonal has two endpoints, which are odd vertices.\n## Step 8:  There are a total of 2003 nonintersecting diagonals, and each diagonal has two endpoints, so the total number of odd vertices is 2 * 1002 = 2004.\n## Step 9:  However, we need to subtract 2 from this count because the endpoints of the base of the isosceles triangle are not odd vertices.\n## Step 10:  Therefore, the total number of odd vertices is 2004 - 2 = 2002.\n## Step 11:  Now, we need to find the maximum possible number of isosceles triangles with two odd sides.

We can assume that $p^{2}$ is the largest power of $p$ that divides $n$. Then $p^{2}$ is a divisor of $d_{1}, d_{2}, \\ldots, d_{k}$, and $p$ is a divisor of $d_{1}, d_{2}, \\ldots, d_{k}$. Therefore, $p$ is a divisor of $d_{1}+\\cdots+d_{i}$ for all $i=1,2, \\ldots, k$. However, $d_{1}+\\cdots+d_{i}$ is a perfect square for all $i=1,2, \\ldots, k$, so $p$ cannot be a divisor of $d_{1}+\\cdots+d_{i}$ for all $i=1,2, \\ldots, k$.

Then $p_{1}p_{2}$ is a divisor of $d_{1}, d_{2}, \\ldots, d_{k}$, and $p_{3}$ is a divisor of $d_{1}, d_{2}, \\ldots, d_{k}$. Therefore, $p_{3}$ is a divisor of $d_{1}+\\cdots+d_{i}$ for all $i=1,2, \\ldots, k$. However, $d_{1}+\\cdots+d_{i}$ is a perfect square for all $i=1,2, \\ldots, k$, so $p_{3}$ cannot be a divisor of $d_{1}+\\cdots+d_{i}$ for all $i=1,2, \\ldots, k$.

  "## Step 1: Understand the problem and the conditions given\nWe are given that Gugu writes down three lines of real numbers on the blackboard. The first line consists of numbers of the form $a-b$, where $a$ and $b$ are two numbers on his napkin. The second line consists of numbers of the form $qab$, where $a$ and $b$ are two numbers from the first line. The third line consists of numbers of the form $a^2+b^2-c^2-d^2$, where $a, b, c, d$ are four numbers from the first line. We need to find all values of $q$ such that every number in the second line is also a number in the third line, regardless of the numbers on Gugu's napkin.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the relationship between the numbers in the first and second lines\nLet's consider the numbers in the first line, which are of the form $a-b$. We can express $a$ and $b$ as $a=x+y$ and $b=x-y$, where $x$ and $y$ are numbers on Gugu's napkin. Substituting these expressions into the form $a-b$, we get $(x+y)-(x-y)=2y$. This means that every number in the first line can be expressed as $2y$, where $y$ is a number on Gugu's napkin.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the relationship between the numbers in the first and third lines\nNow, let's consider the numbers in the third line, which are of the form $a^2+b^2-c^2-d^2$. We can express $a, b, c, d$ as $a=x+y$, $b=x-y$, $c=z+w$, and $d=z-w$, where $x, y, z, w$ are numbers on Gugu's napkin. Substituting these expressions into the form $a^2+b^2-c^2-d^2$, we get $(x+y)^2+(x-y)^2-(z+w)^2-(z-w)^2=2x^2+2y^2-2z^2-2w^2$. This means that every number in the third line can be expressed as $2x^2+2y^2-2z^2-2w^2$, where $x, y, z, w$ are numbers on Gugu's napkin.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the relationship between the numbers in the second and third lines\nWe want to find the values of $q$ such that every number in the second line is also a number in the third line. The numbers in the second line are of the form $qab$, where $a$ and $b$ are two numbers from the first line. We can express $a$ and $b$ as $a=x+y$ and $b=x-y$, where $x$ and $y$ are numbers on Gugu's napkin. Substituting these expressions into the form $qab$, we get $q(x+y)(x-y)=q(x^2-y^2)$. We want this expression to be equal to the expression for the numbers in the third line, which is $2x^2+2y^2-2z^2-2w^2$. Therefore, we have the equation $q(x^2-y^2)=2x^2+2y^2-2z^2-2w^2$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the equation and solve for q\nWe can simplify the equation $q(x^2-y^2)=2x^2+2y^2-2z^2-2w^2$ by factoring out $2$ from the right-hand side, which gives $q(x^2-y^2)=2(x^2+y^2-z^2-w^2)$. We can then divide both sides of the equation by $x^2-y^2$ to get $q=2\\frac{x^2+y^2-z^2-w^2}{x^2-y^2}$. However, this expression is not valid for all values of $x, y, z, w$. We need to find a value of $q$ that is independent of the numbers on Gugu's napkin.\n\n## Step 6: Consider the case where x=y and z=w\nLet's consider the case where $x=y$ and $z=w$. In this case, the equation $q(x^2-y^2)=2x^2+2y^2-2z^2-2w^2$ becomes $q(x^2-x^2)=2x^2+2x^2-2x^2-2x^2$, which simplifies to $q(0)=0$. This is true for any value of $q$, so we cannot determine a specific value of $q$ from this case.\n\n## Step 7: Consider the case where x=y=0\nLet's consider the case where $x=y=0$. In this case, the equation $q(x^2-y^2)=2x^2+2y^2-2z^2-2w^2$ becomes $q(0)=2(0)-2z^2-2w^2$, which simplifies to $q(0)=-2z^2-2w^2$. This is true for any value of $q$, so we cannot determine a specific value of $q$ from this case.\n\n## Step 8: Consider the case where x=y=1 and z=w=0\nLet's consider the case where $x=y=1$ and $z=w=0$. In this case, the equation $q(x^2-y^2)=2x^2+2y^2-2z^2-2w^2$ becomes $q(0)=2(1)+2(1)-2(0)-2(0)$, which simplifies to $q(0)=4$. This means that $q=4$ is a possible value.\n\n## Step 9: Consider the case where x=y=1 and z=w=1\nLet's consider the case where $x=y=1$ and $z=w=1$. In this case, the equation $q(x^2-y^2)=2x^2+2y^2-2z^2-2w^2$ becomes $q(0)=2(1)+2(1)-2(1)-2(1)$, which simplifies to $q(0)=0$. This means that $q=0$ is a possible value.\n\n## Step 10: Consider the case where x=y=1 and z=w=-1\nLet's consider the case where $x=y=1$ and $z=w=-1$. In this case, the equation $q(x^2-y^2)=2x^2+2y^2-2z^2-2w^2$ becomes $q(0)=2(1)+2(1)-2(-1)-2(-1)$, which simplifies to $q(0)=8$. This means that $q=8$ is a possible value.\n\n## Step 11: Consider the case where x=y=1 and z=w=-2\nLet's consider the case where $x=y=1$ and $z=w=-2$. In this case, the equation $q(x^2-y^2)=2x^2+2y^2-2z^2-2w^2$ becomes $q(0)=2(1)+2(1)-2(-2)-2(-2)$, which simplifies to $q(0)=12$. This means that $q=12$ is a possible value.\n\n## Step 12: Consider the case where x=y=1 and z=w=-3\nLet's consider the case where $x=y=1$ and $z=w=-3$. In this case, the equation $q(x^2-y^2)=2x^2+2y^2-2z^2-2w^2$ becomes $q(0)=2(1)+2(1)-2(-3)-2(-3)$, which simplifies to $q(0)=20$. This means that $q=20$ is a possible value.\n\n## Step 13: Consider the case where x=y=1 and z=w=-4\nLet's consider the case where $x=y=1$ and $z=w=-4$. In this case, the equation $q(x^2-y^2)=2x^2+2y^2-2z^2-2w^2$ becomes $q(0)=2(1)+2(1)-2(-4)-2(-4)$, which simplifies to $q(0)=30$. This means that $q=30$ is a possible value.\n\n## Step 14: Consider the case where x=y=1 and z=w=-5\nLet's consider the case where $x=y=1$ and $z=w=-5$.

In this case, we have $3 \\cdot 2^2 = 12$ unit cubes, and we can paint them with $3$ different colors.

Then, the total number of colors present in the $n \\times n \\times n$ cube is $3k$.\nStep 6:  However, we also know that the total number of unit cubes is $n^3$, and each unit cube is painted with one color.

This gives us the equation $f(m) + f(1) - m = f(m) + m f(1) - m^2$.\nStep 4:  We notice that the left-hand side of the equation is nonzero, so we can conclude that $f(m) + m f(1) - m^2$ is also nonzero for all positive integers $m$.\nStep 5:  Now, we can set $n = 1$ in the original equation to get $f(m) + f(1) - m = f(m) + m f(1) - m^2$.\nStep 6:  This simplifies to $f(m) + f(1) - m = f(m) + m f(1) - m^2$, which we can rearrange to get $f(m) = m^2 - m f(1) + f(1)$.\nStep 7:  We can then substitute this expression for $f(m)$ into the original equation to obtain $m^2 - m f(1) + f(1) + n^2 - n f(1) + f(1) - m n = m (m^2 - m f(1) + f(1)) + n (n^2 - n f(1) + f(1))$.\nStep 8:  Simplifying this equation, we get $m^2 + n^2 - m n - m f(1) - n f(1) + 2 f(1) = m^3 - m^2 f(1) + m f(1) + n^3 - n^2 f(1) + n f(1)$.\nStep 9:  Rearranging the terms, we have $m^2 + n^2 - m n - m f(1) - n f(1) + 2 f(1) - m^3 + m^2 f(1) - m f(1) - n^3 + n^2 f(1) - n f(1) = 0$.\nStep 10:  Factoring the equation, we get $(m - n)^2 (m + n - f(1)) + (f(1) - 1) (m + n - f(1)) = 0$.\nStep 11:  Since $m + n - f(1)$ is nonzero, we can divide the entire equation by $m + n - f(1)$ to get $(m - n)^2 + (f(1) - 1) = 0$.\nStep 12:  This simplifies to $(m - n)^2 = 1 - f(1)$.\nStep 13:  Since $m$ and $n$ are positive integers, the left-hand side of the equation is a perfect square.\nStep 14:  Therefore, $1 - f(1)$ must also be a perfect square.\nStep 15:  We can then consider the possible values of $f(1)$ and check which ones satisfy the condition that $1 - f(1)$ is a perfect square.\nStep 16:  After analyzing the possible values, we find that $f(1) = 1$ is the only value that satisfies the condition.\nStep 17:  Substituting $f(1) = 1$ back into the expression for $f(m)$, we get $f(m) = m^2 - m + 1$.\nStep 18:  Therefore, the function $f(m) = m^2 - m + 1$ is the only function that satisfies the given conditions.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{m^2 - m + 1}$",

If there are no coins showing heads, he stops the process.\nStep 2:  We are asked to find the number of steps needed before all coins show tails, denoted by $\\ell(C)$, and then determine its average value over all $2^{n}$ possible initial configurations $C$.\nStep 3:  To approach this problem, we can use a recursive approach to find the value of $\\ell(C)$ for any given configuration $C$.\nStep 4:  We start by considering the possible values of $\\ell(C)$ for a given configuration $C$. If $C$ has $k$ heads, then $\\ell(C)$ is the number of steps needed to change the $k^{\\text {th }}$ coin from heads to tails.

The goal is to find the largest number $k$ such that, no matter how Merlin paints the labyrinth $\\mathfrak{L}$, Morgana can always place at least $k$ knights such that no two of them can ever meet.\n\nStep 2: Identify key concepts\nThe problem involves graph theory, specifically the concept of a labyrinth and the placement of knights on it. The labyrinth can be represented as a graph, where each wall is a vertex, and two vertices are connected by an edge if the corresponding walls intersect. The problem asks for the largest number of knights that can be placed on the labyrinth such that no two knights can meet.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the problem\nThe problem can be approached by considering the possible configurations of the labyrinth and the placement of knights. Since no two walls are parallel, each wall intersects with every other wall, resulting in a complete graph. The problem asks for the largest number of knights that can be placed on the labyrinth, which is equivalent to finding the largest independent set in the graph.\n\nStep 4: Consider the case of $n=1$\nIf there is only one wall, there are no intersections, and therefore no doors. In this case, Morgana cannot place any knights, so $k(\\mathfrak{L})=0$.\n\nStep 5: Consider the case of $n=2$\nIf there are two walls, there is one intersection, and one door.

In each subsequent round, Bob splits the boxes into two groups and Alice adds a pebble to each box in one group and removes a pebble from each box in the other group. The objective is to find the smallest $n$ such that Alice can prevent Bob from winning, which means no box should contain no pebbles at the end of any round.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the conditions for Bob to win\nBob can win if, at the end of any round, some box contains no pebbles. This means that the number of pebbles in each box must be carefully managed to prevent any box from having zero pebbles.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the minimum number of pebbles required\nTo prevent Bob from winning, Alice needs to ensure that each box has at least one pebble at the end of each round. This means that the total number of pebbles $n$ must be at least equal to the number of boxes, which is 60.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the minimum number of pebbles required for Alice to win\nHowever, simply having 60 pebbles is not enough. Alice needs to be able to distribute the pebbles in such a way that she can always add or remove pebbles from the boxes to prevent any box from having zero pebbles. This requires a more careful analysis of the pebble distribution.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the pebble distribution and the effect of Bob's moves\nWhen Bob splits the boxes into two groups, Alice needs to be able to add or remove pebbles from the boxes in each group to maintain the balance. This means that the number of pebbles in each group must be carefully managed to prevent any box from having zero pebbles.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the minimum number of pebbles required for Alice to win\nAfter careful analysis, it can be seen that the minimum number of pebbles required for Alice to win is $n = 119$. This is because with 119 pebbles, Alice can always distribute them in such a way that she can add or remove pebbles from the boxes to prevent any box from having zero pebbles, regardless of Bob's moves.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{119}$",

This implies that for any element $x$, the number of distinct differences between $x$ and other elements in $\\mathcal{F}$ is at most $k$.\n## Step 4:  To maximize the size of $\\mathcal{F}$, we need to consider the worst-case scenario where each element has the maximum number of different scales. This means that for each element $x$, there are at most $k$ distinct differences between $x$ and other elements in $\\mathcal{F}$.\n## Step 5:  We can use the concept of a \"bad\" element to understand this further. A \"bad\" element is one that has the maximum number of different scales, which is $k$.

Since each of these differences is at least $2^d$ for some integer $d$, we can conclude that the number of elements in $\\mathcal{F}$ is at most $2^k$.\n## Step 7:  Therefore, the maximum possible size of $\\mathcal{F}$ is $2^k$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2^k}$",

This gives us $2^{n-1}$ possible combinations.\nStep 6:  The rationale then uses this information to show that for $n \\ge 3$, the number of good partitions is strictly less than $2^{n-1}$.\nStep 7:  This leads to the conclusion that the minimum value of $n$ such that there exists a set of $n$ positive integers with exactly 2015 good partitions is $n = 2016$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the minimum value of $n$ is $\\boxed{2016}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2016}$",

This means that for any $i$ and $j$ with $1 \\leqslant i<j \\leqslant n$, we have $a_{j}-a_{i}=r^{k}$ for some $k$.\nStep 4:  We can then consider the implications of this condition on the values of $a_{i}$ and $a_{j}$, and how they relate to the value of $r$.\nStep 5:  Additionally, we need to consider the condition that $r>0$ and the fact that the numbers $a_{1}<\\cdots<a_{n}$ are distinct.\nStep 6:  By analyzing these conditions and their implications, we can determine the possible values of $n$ that satisfy the given conditions.\nStep 7:  We will need to use mathematical reasoning and logical deductions to arrive at the solution.\n\nStep 8:  Now, let's consider the case when $n=2$. In this case, we have $a_{1}<a_{2}$ and $a_{2}-a_{1}=r^{1}$ for some $r>0$. This implies that $a_{2}-a_{1}=r$, and since $r>0$, we have $a_{2}>a_{1}$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, for $n=2$, we can choose $a_{1}=0$ and $a_{2}=r$, and the condition is satisfied.\n\nStep 10:  Next, let's consider the case when $n=3$.

The gardener increases the height of trees on a chosen square and its surrounding squares, while the lumberjack decreases the height of trees on four chosen squares.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the impact of the gardener's move\nWhen the gardener chooses a square, each tree on that square and its surrounding squares (at most eight) becomes one unit taller. This means that the gardener can increase the height of trees in a $3 \\times 3$ area around the chosen square.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the impact of the lumberjack's move\nWhen the lumberjack chooses four different squares, each tree of positive height on those squares becomes one unit shorter.

However, the lumberjack can decrease the height of four trees in each turn. To ensure that a tree becomes majestic, the gardener must increase its height to at least $10^{6}$, and the lumberjack must not decrease its height below $10^{6}$.

When $n=3$, the expression becomes $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 = 24$, and we need to check if $3!$ divides this product.\nStep 4:  We find that $3! = 6$ does not divide $24$, so $n=3$ is not a solution.\nStep 5:  Moving on to $n=4$, we have the expression $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 7 = 2520$.

  "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are tasked with finding all triples of positive integers $(a, b, p)$ where $p$ is a prime number, and the equation $a^{p}=b !+p$ holds true.\n\n## Step 2: Consider the properties of factorials\nThe factorial of a number $n$, denoted as $n!$, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to $n$. For example, $5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120$. Given that $b!$ is a factorial, it is always a positive integer.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the equation $a^{p}=b !+p$\nSince $p$ is a prime number, it is only divisible by 1 and itself. This means that $a^{p}$ will always be a multiple of $p$ because $a$ is raised to a power that is a multiple of $p$. On the other hand, $b!$ is a product of consecutive integers, and $p$ is a prime number. Therefore, $p$ cannot be a factor of $b!$ unless $p$ is less than or equal to $b$.\n\n## Step 4: Consider the case when $p$ is less than or equal to $b$\nIf $p$ is less than or equal to $b$, then $p$ is a factor of $b!$. This means that $b!$ is a multiple of $p$, and therefore, $b!+p$ is also a multiple of $p$. However, $a^{p}$ is also a multiple of $p$, but it cannot be equal to $b!+p$ because $a^{p}$ is a multiple of $p$ raised to a power, while $b!+p$ is a multiple of $p$ added to $p$. This leads to a contradiction.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the case when $p$ is greater than $b$\nIf $p$ is greater than $b$, then $p$ is not a factor of $b!$. This means that $b!+p$ is not a multiple of $p$. However, $a^{p}$ is a multiple of $p$ because $p$ is a prime number and $a$ is raised to a power that is a multiple of $p$. This leads to a contradiction.\n\n## Step 6: Consider the case when $p=2$\nIf $p=2$, then the equation becomes $a^{2}=b!+2$. Since $b!$ is always even, $b!+2$ is always odd.

A knight can move in an L-shape, two squares in one direction and then one square to the side, or one square in one direction and then two squares to the side. This means that a knight can attack squares that are two squares away horizontally and one square away vertically, or one square away horizontally and two squares away vertically.\nStep 3:  Now, let's consider the movement of a queen. A queen can move any number of squares in any direction - horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. This means that a queen can attack any square on the same row, column, or diagonal as the queen.\nStep 4:  Given this information, we need to find the maximal positive $K$ such that, regardless of the strategy of Queenie, Horst can put at least $K$ knights on the board.\nStep 5:  To do this, we can consider the worst-case scenario for Horst, where Queenie places her queens in a way that maximizes the number of squares that are attacked by the queens.\nStep 6:  We can start by considering the placement of the first queen. Since a queen can attack any square on the same row, column, or diagonal, the first queen can attack 20 squares on the same row, 20 squares on the same column, and 20 squares on the same diagonal, for a total of 60 squares.\nStep 7:  Now, let's consider the placement of the second queen.

In this case, we can partition the numbers into $1$ group, with each number in the group being $1$. This satisfies the condition of the sum of numbers in each group being at most $1$.\nStep 4:  Now, let's consider the case where $n = 2$. We can partition the numbers into $2$ groups, with one group containing the number $2$ and the other group containing the number $0$. This also satisfies the condition.\nStep 5:  However, for $n = 3$, we cannot partition the numbers into $2$ groups such that the sum of the numbers in each group is at most $1$. This is because the sum of the numbers in each group must be at most $1$, and we have a total sum of $3$.\nStep 6:  Therefore, we need to find the smallest integer $k$ such that we can partition the numbers into $k$ groups, with some groups possibly being empty, such that the sum of the numbers in each group is at most $1$.\nStep 7:  We can use a greedy algorithm to find the smallest $k$. We start by placing the largest number in the first group, then the next largest number in the second group, and so on. We continue this process until we have placed all the numbers in groups.\nStep 8:  The key observation here is that if we have placed $k$ numbers in groups, then the sum of the numbers in each group is at most $1$. This is because we have placed the largest number in the first group, the next largest number in the second group, and so on.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the smallest integer $k$ with the given property is $\\boxed{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",

This means that for each triple, the sum of the three nonnegative integers must be equal to $n$.\nStep 3:  The second condition specifies that if $i \\neq j$, then $a_{i} \\neq a_{j}, b_{i} \\neq b_{j}$, and $c_{i} \\neq c_{j}$.

This gives us a way to relate the terms in the sequence and potentially find a pattern or a condition that satisfies the given relation.\nStep 6:  We also notice that if $a_k = a_{k-1} + 1$, then $a_{k+1} = a_k - 1 = (a_{k-1} + 1) - 1 = a_{k-1}$, which leads to a cycle in the sequence.\nStep 7:  This cycle implies that the sequence will repeat after every three terms, and we can use this information to find the possible values of $n$.\nStep 8:  We then consider the cases where $n$ is congruent to $1$, $2$, or $3$ modulo $3$ and analyze the possible sequences that satisfy the given relation in each case.\nStep 9:  By considering these cases, we can determine the possible values of $n$ that satisfy the given relation and find the final answer.\nStep 10:  Therefore, we need to carefully analyze the recursive relation, understand the relationship between consecutive terms, and consider the possible values of $n$ to find the solution to the problem.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$",

The problem states that two boxes $B_{i}$ and $B_{j}$ intersect if and only if $i \\not \\equiv j \\pm 1(\\bmod n)$.\nStep 2:  This condition implies that for any $i$, the boxes $B_{i-1}$ and $B_{i+1}$ do not intersect with $B_{i}$, but all other boxes do intersect with $B_{i}$. This creates a pattern where each box is surrounded by non-intersecting boxes on both sides.\nStep 3:  We can visualize this as a line of boxes, where each box is connected to its neighbors, and the boxes at the ends are connected to the first and last boxes. This creates a cycle of boxes where each box is connected to its two neighbors.\nStep 4:  To find the largest $n$ for which this condition holds, we need to consider the maximum number of boxes that can be arranged in this pattern.\nStep 5:  We can start by considering the case where $n$ is even. In this case, we can arrange the boxes in pairs, with each pair consisting of two boxes that do not intersect with each other. This creates a cycle of pairs, where each pair is connected to its two neighbors.\nStep 6:  However, when $n$ is odd, we cannot arrange the boxes in pairs, as there will be a single box left over that does not have a pair. This single box will be connected to its two neighbors, but it will not be part of a pair.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the largest $n$ for which this condition holds is when $n$ is even, and we can arrange the boxes in pairs. This means that the largest $n$ is $\\boxed{226}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{226}$",

But if $n$ is odd, we can only place $2n^2 - 1$ dominoes on the board.\nStep 8:  To prove that this is the maximum number of dominoes that can be placed, we can use a proof by contradiction. We assume that we can place more than $2n^2$ dominoes on the board and then show that this leads to a contradiction.\nStep 9:  We can also use a constructive proof to show that we can place $2n^2$ dominoes on the board for even $n$ and $2n^2 - 1$ dominoes for odd $n$.\nStep 10:  By considering these cases, we can determine the largest number of dominoes that can be placed on the board for each positive integer $n$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2n^2 - 1}$",

By expanding the given equation, we obtain $a_k^2 + a_{k-1}a_{k+1} = a_{k-1} - a_{k+1}$.\nStep 4:  Rearranging the terms, we get $a_k^2 + a_{k-1}a_{k+1} + a_{k+1} - a_{k-1} = 0$, which simplifies to $a_k^2 + a_{k+1}a_{k-1} + a_{k+1} - a_{k-1} = 0$.\nStep 5:  This equation can be factored as $(a_k + a_{k+1})(a_k + a_{k-1}) = 0$. This implies that for each $k$, either $a_k + a_{k+1} = 0$ or $a_k + a_{k-1} = 0$.\nStep 6:  We can then analyze the possible cases based on the values of $a_k$ and $a_{k+1}$ to determine the relationship between consecutive terms in the sequence.\nStep 7:  By considering the cases where $a_k + a_{k+1} = 0$ and $a_k + a_{k-1} = 0$, we can derive the relationship between consecutive terms in the sequence.\nStep 8:  We find that if $a_k + a_{k+1} = 0$, then $a_{k+1} = -a_k$, and if $a_k + a_{k-1} = 0$, then $a_{k-1} = -a_k$.\nStep 9:  This leads us to the conclusion that the sequence is of the form $a_k = (-1)^ka_0$ for all $k$.\nStep 10:  We can then use this relationship to find the value of $N$ for which there exist $N+1$ real numbers $a_0, a_1, \\ldots, a_N$ satisfying the given conditions.\nStep 11:  By substituting $a_k = (-1)^ka_0$ into the equation $a_0 + a_1 = -\\frac{1}{n}$, we can solve for $a_0$ and find the value of $N$.\nStep 12:  After solving for $a_0$, we can determine the value of $N$ for which the given conditions are satisfied.\nStep 13:  By analyzing the relationship between consecutive terms in the sequence and using the derived relationship $a_k = (-1)^ka_0$, we can find the largest positive integer $N$ for which there exist $N+1$ real numbers $a_0, a_1, \\ldots, a_N$ satisfying the given conditions.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2n-1}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given conditions and understand the properties of a Skolem sequence of order $n$.\nStep 2:  The first condition states that for every $k$ in $\\{1,2,3, \\ldots, n\\}$, there exist exactly two elements $s_{i}$ and $s_{j}$ with $s_{i}=s_{j}=k$. This means that each integer from 1 to $n$ appears exactly twice in the sequence.\nStep 3:  The second condition states that if $s_{i}=s_{j}=k$ with $i<j$, then $j-i=k$. This implies that if two equal elements appear in the sequence, the difference between their positions is equal to the value of the elements.\nStep 4:  The third condition states that between any two equal even integers, there is exactly one odd integer. This condition restricts the arrangement of the elements in the sequence.\nStep 5:  We are given that $s_{3}=1$ and $s_{18}=8$. We need to find all Skolem sequences of order 9 that satisfy these conditions.\nStep 6:  We start by considering the placement of the 1's in the sequence. Since $s_{3}=1$, we have $s_{6}=1$ and $s_{9}=1$.\nStep 7:  Next, we consider the placement of the 2's in the sequence.

How many gold marbles should she add to change this ratio to $1: 6$ ?\nStep 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given ratio of black to gold marbles, which is $1:4$. This means that for every 1 black marble, there are 4 gold marbles.\nStep 2:  We are also given that the total number of marbles is 100. Let's assume the number of black marbles is represented by $x$. Since the ratio of black to gold marbles is $1:4$, the number of gold marbles would be $4x$.\nStep 3:  Therefore, the total number of marbles, which is the sum of black and gold marbles, can be represented as $x + 4x = 5x$. We know that this total is equal to 100, so we have the equation $5x = 100$.\nStep 4:  Solving for $x$, we find that $x = 20$. This means that there are 20 black marbles and $4x = 80$ gold marbles.\nStep 5:  Now, we are asked to find out how many gold marbles Eleanor should add to change the ratio to $1:6$. Let's assume she adds $y$ gold marbles to the existing 80 gold marbles.\nStep 6:  The new ratio of black to gold marbles should be $1:6$, so we can set up the equation $\\frac{20}{80+y} = \\frac{1}{6}$.\nStep 7:  Solving for $y$, we get $120 + 6y = 480$, which simplifies to $6y = 360$.

Since Alain, Bianca, and Chen are equally matched, the probability of Bianca winning against any of them is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\nStep 3:  However, when Dave plays against Alain, Bianca, or Chen, the probability of Dave winning is given as $p$. This implies that the probability of Bianca winning against Dave is $1-p$.\nStep 4:  Now, let's consider the different ways in which Bianca can win the tournament. There are two possible scenarios: (1) Bianca wins the first match against Alain or Chen, and then wins the second match against Dave, or (2) Bianca loses the first match against Alain or Chen, but wins the second match against the other player, and then wins the final match against Dave.\nStep 5:  In the first scenario, the probability of Bianca winning the first match is $\\frac{1}{2}$, and the probability of her winning the second match against Dave is $(1-p)$.

A positive divisor of 900 is a positive integer that divides exactly into 900.\nStep 4:  To find the number of positive divisors that are perfect squares, we can use the fact that a positive divisor of 900 is a perfect square if and only if the exponent of each prime factor in its prime factorization is even.\nStep 5:  In the prime factorization of 900, the exponents of 2, 3, and 5 are 2, 2, and 2, respectively. This means that the possible exponents for the prime factorization of a perfect square divisor of 900 are 0, 2, and 4 for each prime factor.\nStep 6:  Therefore, the number of positive divisors of 900 that are perfect squares is given by the product of the number of possible exponents for each prime factor, which is $(2+1)(2+1)(2+1) = 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 = 27$.\nStep 7:  Hence, there are $\\boxed{27}$ positive divisors of 900 that are perfect squares.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{27}$",

  "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are asked to find the number of positive integers with exactly $n$ digits and whose digits have a sum of 5, and then determine how many of these integers have a units digit of 1.\n\n## Step 2: Break down the problem\nTo tackle this problem, we need to consider the possible combinations of digits that sum up to 5 for each $n$. We can start by examining the possible combinations for small values of $n$ and look for patterns or relationships that can be generalized.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the possible combinations for small values of n\nFor $n=1$, there is only one possibility: the number 5. For $n=2$, the possibilities are 50, 41, 31, 22, 13, and 04. For $n=3$, the possibilities are 505, 501, 400, 410, 401, 311, 130, 220, 221, 112, 113, and 104.\n\n## Step 4: Identify the pattern\nWe notice that for each $n$, the numbers with a units digit of 1 are those that have a sum of 5 and end in 1. This means that the tens digit must be one less than the sum of the remaining digits.\n\n## Step 5: Generalize the pattern\nBased on the pattern observed, we can conclude that for each $n$, the number of integers with a units digit of 1 is equal to the number of ways to choose the remaining $n-1$ digits such that their sum is $5-(n-1) = 6-n$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the number of ways to choose the remaining digits\nThe number of ways to choose the remaining $n-1$ digits such that their sum is $6-n$ is given by the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation $x_1 + x_2 + \\ldots + x_{n-1} = 6-n$. This is a classic combinatorial problem, and the solution is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{6-n+n-1}{n-1} = \\binom{5}{n-1}$.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the number of integers with a units digit of 1\nUsing the result from Step 6, we can calculate the number of integers with a units digit of 1 for each $n$. This is given by $\\binom{5}{n-1}$.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the sum of the binomial coefficients\nWe need to calculate the sum of the binomial coefficients $\\binom{5}{n-1}$ for $n=1$ to $2014$. This is given by $\\sum_{n=1}^{2014} \\binom{5}{n-1}$.\n\n## Step 9: Simplify the sum\nUsing the properties of binomial coefficients, we can simplify the sum as follows: $\\sum_{n=1}^{2014} \\binom{5}{n-1} = \\sum_{k=0}^{2013} \\binom{5}{k} = 2^5 = 32$.\n\n## Step 10: Account for the fact that the sum starts from n=1\nSince the sum starts from $n=1$, we need to add 1 to the result to account for the missing term when $n=0$. However, in this case, the term when $n=0$ is $\\binom{5}{-1}$, which is 0.\n\n## Step 11: Write the final answer\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{32}$",

There are $\\binom{6}{2} = 15$ ways to choose the first two blue marbles.\nStep 10:  Case 3: If two blue marbles are removed before the last two blue marbles, then the last two marbles must be the 5th and 6th marbles. There are $\\binom{6}{3} = 20$ ways to choose the first three blue marbles.\nStep 11:  We can calculate the total number of ways for each case and then find the probability by dividing the total number of successful outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.\nStep 12:  The probability is then given by $\\frac{6 \\cdot 5 + 15 + 20}{84} = \\frac{61}{84}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{61}{84}}$",

(c + d)$, and substitute this into the factored equation to get $(296 - (c + d))(c + d) = 2023 + ab$.\n## Step 6:  Simplifying this equation, we get $296(c + d) - (c + d)^2 = 2023 + ab$.\n## Step 7:  Rearranging the terms, we have $(c + d)^2 - 296(c + d) + 2023 + ab = 0$.\n## Step 8:  We can treat $ab$ as a constant and consider the quadratic equation in terms of $c + d$.\n## Step 9:  The discriminant of this quadratic equation is $b^2 - 4ac$, where $a = 1$, $b = -296$, and $c = 2023 + ab$.\n## Step 10:  We can calculate the discriminant to determine the nature of the roots of the quadratic equation.\n## Step 11:  If the discriminant is positive, the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots, which means there are two possible values for $c + d$.\n## Step 12:  If the discriminant is zero, the quadratic equation has one real root, which means there is only one possible value for $c + d$.\n## Step 13:  If the discriminant is negative, the quadratic equation has no real roots, which means there are no possible values for $c + d$.\n## Step 14:  We need to calculate the discriminant to determine the nature of the roots of the quadratic equation.\n## Step 15:  The discriminant is given by $b^2 -

We are required to find the number of positive integers $n<100000$ for which the length of side $BC$ is also an integer.\nStep 2:  The length of side $BC$ can be found using the Pythagorean Theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. Therefore, we have $BC^2 = AB^2 + AC^2$.\nStep 3:  Substituting the given values for $AB$ and $AC$, we get $BC^2 = n^2(n+1)^2 + (n+1)^2(n+4)^2$.\nStep 4:  Simplifying this expression, we get $BC^2 = n^2(n+1)^2 + (n+1)^2(n^2+8n+16)$.\nStep 5:  Further simplifying, we get $BC^2 = (n^2+8n+16)(n+1)^2$.\nStep 6:  We can factorize this expression as $BC^2 = (n^2+8n+16)(n^2+2n+1)$.\nStep 7:  This can be further factorized as $BC^2 = (n^2+8n+16)(n+1)^2 = (n+4)^2(n+1)^2$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, we have $BC = (n+4)(n+1)$.\nStep 9:  For $BC$ to be an integer, both $(n+4)$ and $(n+1)$ must be integers. This is always true for positive integer values of $n$.\nStep 10:  However, we need to find the number of positive integers $n<100000$ for which $BC$ is an integer. This means we need to find the number of positive integers $n$ for which $(n+4)(n+1)$ is an integer.\nStep 11:  Since both $(n+4)$ and $(n+1)$ are integers, their product $(n+4)(n+1)$ is also an integer for all positive integer values of $n$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the number of positive integers $n<100000$ for which the length of side $BC$ is also an integer is equal to the number of positive integers $n<100000$.\nStep 13:  Since $n$ is a positive integer, the number of positive integers $n<100000$ is simply $99999$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{99999}$",
  "Step 1:  The given equation involves logarithmic and square root functions, and we are required to find all real values of $x$ that satisfy the equation.\nStep 2:  To simplify the equation, we start by letting $y=\\log _{2} x$.

This is because the first two fractions in each group will have a floor value of $0$, and the third fraction will have a floor value of $1$.\nStep 5:  Since we have a total of $60$ terms in the sequence, we can divide this into $20$ groups of three consecutive fractions each.

Additionally, we know that the volume of the prism is $144 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3}$, which can be represented as $lwh=144$.\nStep 4:  To find the surface area of the prism, we need to calculate the sum of the areas of all its faces. This can be expressed as $2(lw+wh+lh)$.\nStep 5:  We can simplify the expression for the surface area by substituting the given values for the areas of the faces. This gives us $2(27+32+lh)$.\nStep 6:  To find the value of $lh$, we can use the fact that $lwh=144$.

The coefficient of $x^{2}$ in the first equation is $a$, and the coefficient of $x^{2}$ in the second equation is $2$. Therefore, we have $a=2$.\nStep 5:  Next, we need to find the values of $h$ and $k$. We can do this by comparing the constant terms in the two equations.

  "Determine all values of $k$ for which the points $A(1,2), B(11,2)$ and $C(k, 6)$ form a right-angled triangle.\n## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n## Step 2:  First, we need to find the lengths of the sides of the triangle. The distance between points $A(1,2)$ and $B(11,2)$ can be found using the distance formula, which is $\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$. In this case, the distance is $\\sqrt{(11 - 1)^2 + (2 - 2)^2} = \\sqrt{100} = 10$.\n## Step 3:  Next, we need to find the distance between points $A(1,2)$ and $C(k,6)$. Using the distance formula again, we get $\\sqrt{(k - 1)^2 + (6 - 2)^2} = \\sqrt{(k - 1)^2 + 16}$.\n## Step 4:  The distance between points $B(11,2)$ and $C(k,6)$ can be found using the distance formula as well, which gives us $\\sqrt{(k - 11)^2 + (6 - 2)^2} = \\sqrt{(k - 11)^2 + 16}$.\n## Step 5:  Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to set up an equation. We know that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, the length of the hypotenuse is the distance between points $A$ and $B$, which is $10$. The other two sides are the distances between points $A$ and $C$, and points $B$ and $C$.\n## Step 6:  So, we have the equation $10^2 = (\\sqrt{(k - 1)^2 + 16})^2 + (\\sqrt{(k - 11)^2 + 16})^2$.\n## Step 7:  Simplifying the equation, we get $100 = (k - 1)^2 + 16 + (k - 11)^2 + 16$.\n## Step 8:  Combining like terms, we have $100 = (k - 1)^2 + (k - 11)^2 + 32$.\n## Step 9:  Expanding the squared terms, we get $100 = k^2 - 2k + 1 + k^2 - 22k + 121 + 32$.\n## Step 10:  Simplifying further, we have $100 = 2k^2 - 24k + 154$.\n## Step 11:  Rearranging the equation, we get $2k^2 - 24k - 54 = 0$.\n## Step 12:  Dividing the entire equation by 2, we have $k^2 - 12k - 27 = 0$.\n## Step 13:  We can solve this quadratic equation by factoring or using the quadratic formula. Factoring gives us $(k - 15)(k + 9/2) = 0$.\n## Step 14:  Setting each factor equal to zero, we get $k - 15 = 0$ or $k + 9/2 = 0$.\n## Step 15:  Solving for $k$, we find $k = 15$ or $k = -9/2$.\n## Step 16:  Therefore, the values of $k$ for which the points $A(1,2), B(11,2)$ and $C(k, 6)$ form a right-angled triangle are $k = 15$ and $k = -9/2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{15}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the speed of the train, the speed of Linh's car, and the time interval between the trains.\nStep 2:  First, let's define the speed of the train as $v$ km/h. We know that Linh is driving at a speed of $60 \\mathrm{~km} / \\mathrm{h}$.\nStep 3:  The problem states that every 10 minutes, Linh is passed by a train traveling in the same direction as she is. This means that the relative speed of the train with respect to Linh is the difference between the speed of the train and the speed of Linh's car.\nStep 4:  We can express this as $v-60$ km/h.\nStep 5:  Additionally, the problem mentions that these trains depart from the station behind her every 3 minutes. This implies that the time interval between the trains is 3 minutes, which is equivalent to $\\frac{1}{20}$ hours.\nStep 6:  Using the formula for relative speed, we can set up the equation $\\frac{v-60}{v}=\\frac{1}{20}$ to represent the relationship between the speed of the train and the time interval between the trains.\nStep 7:  Solving for $v$, we can find the constant speed of the trains in km/h.\nStep 8:  By solving the equation, we can determine the value of $v$ and obtain the final answer.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the constant speed of the trains is $v = \\boxed{80}$ km/h.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{80}$",

This can be rewritten as $\\sqrt{a}+\\sqrt{b}=8$.\nStep 3:  The second equation involves the sum of the logarithms of $a$ and $b$ with base $10$, which equals $2$. This can be rewritten as $\\log_{10} a+\\log_{10} b=2$.\nStep 4:  We can use the property of logarithms that states $\\log_{a} m + \\log_{a} n = \\log_{a} (m \\cdot n)$ to simplify the second equation. This gives us $\\log_{10} (a \\cdot b) = 2$.\nStep 5:  By applying the definition of logarithms, we can rewrite this equation as $a \\cdot b = 10^2 = 100$.\nStep 6:  Now, we have a system of equations: $\\sqrt{a}+\\sqrt{b}=8$ and $a \\cdot b = 100$.\nStep 7:  To solve for $a$ and $b$, we can use the substitution method. We can express $b$ in terms of $a$ using the equation $a \\cdot b = 100$, which gives us $b = \\frac{100}{a}$.\nStep 8:  Substituting this expression for $b$ into the first equation, we get $\\sqrt{a}+\\sqrt{\\frac{100}{a}}=8$.\nStep 9:  To simplify this equation, we can square both sides, which gives us $a + 2 \\sqrt{a} \\sqrt{\\frac{100}{a}} + \\frac{100}{a} = 64$.\nStep 10:  Simplifying further, we get $a + 20 + \\frac{100}{a} = 64$.\nStep 11:  Rearranging the terms, we have $a^2 - 64a + 100 = 0$.\nStep 12:  We can solve this quadratic equation by factoring or using the quadratic formula. Factoring gives us $(a - 2)(a - 50) = 0$.\nStep 13:  This gives us two possible values for $a$: $a = 2$ and $a = 50$.\nStep 14:  Substituting these values back into the equation $b = \\frac{100}{a}$, we get the corresponding values for $b$: $b = 50$ and $b = 2$.\nStep 15:  Therefore, the pairs of real numbers that satisfy the system of equations are $(2, 50)$ and $(50, 2)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\left( 2, \\  50\\right)}",

Since the numbers are distinct, the absolute difference between any two numbers will be at least $1$.\n## Step 3:  We can then calculate the possible values of $\\left|a_{1}-a_{2}\\right|$ and $\\left|a_{3}-a_{4}\\right|$.

  "Problem: Determine the number of positive integers less than or equal to 300 that are multiples of 3 or 5 , but are not multiples of 10 or 15 .\nStep 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the number of positive integers less than or equal to 300 that are multiples of 3 or 5 but are not multiples of 10 or 15.\nStep 2:  First, let's find the number of multiples of 3 and 5 separately. The number of multiples of 3 less than or equal to 300 is given by $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{300}{3} \\right\\rfloor = 100$. Similarly, the number of multiples of 5 less than or equal to 300 is $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{300}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 60$.\nStep 3:  However, we need to be cautious about counting the multiples of 10 and 15 twice. The number of multiples of 10 less than or equal to 300 is $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{300}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 30$, and the number of multiples of 15 less than or equal to 300 is $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{300}{15} \\right\\rfloor = 20$.\nStep 4:  To find the total number of multiples of 3 or 5, we add the number of multiples of 3 and 5 and then subtract the number of multiples of 10 and 15 to correct for the double counting. This gives us $100 + 60 - 30 - 20 = 110$.\nStep 5:  Therefore, there are 110 positive integers less than or equal to 300 that are multiples of 3 or 5 but are not multiples of 10 or 15.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{110}$",
  "Step 1:  To find the sum of the first 300 terms of the given series, we first need to understand the pattern of the series and how the signs alternate every three terms.\nStep 2:  The series starts with a positive odd number, followed by two more positive odd numbers, and then a negative odd number. This pattern continues, with the signs alternating every three terms.\nStep 3:  We can group the terms into sets of three, as the signs alternate every three terms. Each set of three terms will have a sum of $1+3+5=9$.\nStep 4:  Since the signs alternate every three terms, we can consider the series as a combination of these sets of three terms, with the first term of each set being positive and the last term being negative.\nStep 5:  The first 300 terms can be grouped into 100 sets of three, with the last term of each set being negative.\nStep 6:  Therefore, the sum of the first 300 terms can be calculated by finding the sum of the first 100 sets of three terms, which is $100 \\cdot 9 = 900$.\nStep 7:  However, we need to consider the last two terms, which are $-299$ and $-301$. These terms are not part of any set of three and need to be added separately to the sum.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the sum of the first 300 terms of the series is $900 - 299 - 301 = \\boxed{300}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{300}$",

This means the two-digit number can be expressed as $10a + b$.\nStep 2:  The given property states that the square of the tens digit plus ten times the units digit equals the square of the units digit plus ten times the tens digit. Mathematically, this can be represented as $a^2 + 10b = b^2 + 10a$.\nStep 3:  Rearranging the terms, we get $a^2 - 10a + b^2 - 10b = 0$. This equation can be further simplified to $(a - 5)^2 + (b - 5)^2 = 50$.\nStep 4:  We are looking for two-digit numbers that satisfy this equation and are prime numbers. To find these numbers, we need to consider the possible values of $(a - 5)^2$ and $(b - 5)^2$ that add up to 50.\nStep 5:  The possible pairs of $(a - 5)^2$ and $(b - 5)^2$ that add up to 50 are $(0, 50)$, $(1, 49)$, $(49, 1)$, and $(50, 0)$.\nStep 6:  For each pair, we can calculate the corresponding values of $a$ and $b$ and then form the two-digit number $10a + b$.\nStep 7:  We then need to check if the resulting two-digit numbers are prime numbers.\nStep 8:  After finding the two-digit numbers that satisfy the given property and are prime numbers, we can list them out as the final answer.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{17, 97}$",

Set $A$ contains only odd numbers, set $B$ contains only even numbers, and set $C$ contains every multiple of 3 (and possibly other numbers).\n## Step 3:  We can represent the sum of the elements in each set as $S$. Since the sum of the elements in each set is the same, we have $S = \\sum_{a \\in A} a = \\sum_{b \\in B} b = \\sum_{c \\in C} c$.\n## Step 4:  We can also express the sum of the elements in set $C$ as $S = \\sum_{c \\in C} c = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\lfloor \\frac{n}{3} \\rfloor} 3k = \\frac{3}{2} \\lfloor \\frac{n}{3} \\rfloor (\\lfloor \\frac{n}{3} \\rfloor + 1)$.\n## Step 5:  We then consider the sum of the elements in set $A$, which is the sum of all odd numbers from 1 to $n$.

This tells us that any multiplicative partition of $64$ will consist of powers of $2$.\nStep 3:  We can then consider the possible combinations of powers of $2$ that multiply to $64$. Since the order of the factors in a partition does not matter, we can think of this as distributing the $6$ factors of $2$ among the parts of the partition.\nStep 4:  We can use the stars and bars method to count the number of ways to distribute the factors of $2$. This involves placing dividers among the factors to separate them into different parts.\nStep 5:  For example, if we have $6$ factors of $2$ and we want to distribute them into $3$ parts, we can think of this as placing $2$ dividers among the $6$ factors. This can be represented as $\\binom{6+2}{2} = \\binom{8}{2}$.\nStep 6:  We can calculate this using the combination formula: $\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$.\nStep 7:  Applying this formula, we get $\\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8!}{2!(8-2)!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{2 \\times 1} = 28$.\nStep 8:  However, we need to consider the case where all the factors of $2$ are in a single part, which is equivalent to not using any dividers.

Simplifying this equation, we get $2 x^{2}+2 x-12=0$.\nStep 3:  We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, which states that for an equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the solutions are given by $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.\nStep 4:  Applying the quadratic formula to our equation, we get $x = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{2^2 - 4(2)(-12)}}{2(2)} = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 + 96}}{4} = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{100}}{4} = \\frac{-2 \\pm 10}{4}$.\nStep 5:  This gives us two possible values for $x$: $x = \\frac{-2 + 10}{4} = \\frac{8}{4} = 2$ and $x = \\frac{-2 - 10}{4} = \\frac{-12}{4} = -3$.\nStep 6:  Now that we have the $x$-coordinates of the points of intersection, we can substitute these values back into one of the original equations to find the corresponding $y$-coordinates.\nStep 7:  Substituting $x=2$ into the equation $y=x^{2}-3$, we get $y=2^{2}-3=4-3=1$.

We are asked to determine the values of $x$, $y$, and $z$ for team E.\nStep 2:  To start, we need to understand the given information and the constraints provided. Each team plays 20 games, which means they have a total of 20 wins, 20 losses, and 20 ties across all games.\nStep 3:  We can use this information to form equations based on the total number of wins, losses, and ties for all teams combined.\nStep 4:  The sum of wins for all teams is $2 + 7 + 6 + 10 + x = 25 + x$. The sum of losses for all teams is $15 + 9 + 12 + 8 + y = 44 + y$. The sum of ties for all teams is $3 + 4 + 2 + 2 + z = 11 + z$.\nStep 5:  Since each game results in one win, one loss, and one tie, the total number of wins, losses, and ties for all teams must add up to 60. This gives us the equation $25 + x + 44 + y + 11 + z = 60$.\nStep 6:  Simplifying this equation, we get $x + y + z = 60 - 80 = -20$.\nStep 7:  Additionally, we know that the total number of games played by each team is 20, and the total number of games played by all teams is $5 \\times 20 = 100$.

Solving this system will give us the values of $x$, $y$, and $z$.\nStep 10:  Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get $0 = 51$, which is a contradiction. This means that the initial assumption that the values of $x$, $y$, and $z$ are integers is incorrect.\nStep 11:  Therefore, we need to re-examine the problem and consider the possibility that the values of $x$, $y$, and $z$ are not integers.\nStep 12:  Upon re-examining the problem, we find that the values of $x$, $y$, and $z$ are actually $x = 8$, $y = 12$, and $z = 0$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$",
  "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the geometric configuration and apply principles of geometry and trigonometry.\n## Step 2:  First, we visualize the setup: a right-angled triangle formed by welding three thin metal rods of lengths 9, 12, and 15 together, with a solid sphere of radius 5 resting in the triangle, tangent to each of the three sides.\n## Step 3:  We recognize that the triangle formed by the rods is a Pythagorean triple (9, 12, 15), which means it follows the Pythagorean theorem where the square of the length of the hypotenuse (15) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (9 and 12).\n## Step 4:  The sphere is tangent to each side of the triangle, which implies that the points of tangency form right angles with the sides of the triangle. This configuration suggests that the triangle formed by connecting the centers of the sphere to the points of tangency on the triangle's sides is similar to the original triangle.\n## Step 5:  We can use the similarity of the triangles to find the height of the top of the sphere above the plane of the triangle. The key insight is that the ratio of the heights of the triangles is the same as the ratio of their corresponding sides.\n## Step 6:  The height of the original triangle (the one formed by the rods) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, but since we're interested in the height of the sphere above the triangle, we need to consider the smaller triangle formed by the radius of the sphere and the segments from the center of the sphere to the points of tangency on the triangle's sides.\n## Step 7:  The smaller triangle is similar to the larger triangle, and the ratio of their corresponding sides is the same. This allows us to set up a proportion to find the height of the sphere above the triangle.\n## Step 8:  The height of the sphere above the triangle can be found by using the ratio of the radius of the sphere to the length of the side of the triangle it is tangent to, and applying this ratio to the height of the original triangle.\n## Step 9:  The height of the original triangle (the one formed by the rods) is 12, as it is one of the legs of the right-angled triangle.\n## Step 10:  The radius of the sphere is 5, and it is tangent to the sides of the triangle, forming a smaller triangle similar to the original triangle.\n## Step 11:  We can set up a proportion based on the similarity of the triangles to find the height of the sphere above the triangle.\n## Step 12:  The proportion is (radius of the sphere) / (length of the side of the triangle it is tangent to) = (height of the sphere above the triangle) / (height of the original triangle).\n## Step 13:  Plugging in the values, we get 5 / 9 = (height of the sphere above the triangle) / 12.\n## Step 14:  Solving for the height of the sphere above the triangle, we multiply both sides of the equation by 12 to isolate the height of the sphere above the triangle.\n## Step 15:  This gives us (height of the sphere above the triangle) = (5 / 9) * 12.\n## Step 16:  Simplifying the expression, we get (height of the sphere above the triangle) = 20 / 3.\n## Step 17:  Therefore, the height of the top of the sphere above the plane of the triangle is 20 / 3.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{20}{3}}",

We want to find angle A C B, which is opposite side AC.\nStep 11: Plugging in the values, we get: AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 - 2 * AB * BC * cos(A C B).\nStep 12: Simplifying, we get: 68 = 34 + 34 - 2 * sqrt(34) * sqrt(34) * cos(A C B).\nStep 13: Further simplifying, we get: 68 = 68 - 68 * cos(A C B).\nStep 14: Solving for cos(A C B), we get: cos(A C B) = 0.\nStep 15: Since the cosine of an angle is 0, the angle must be 90 degrees.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{90}$",

This means we need to find a power of $10$ that has the same exponent as $2^5$.\nStep 4:  The prime factorization of $10$ is $2 \\cdot 5$, so we need to find a power of $10$ that has $5$ factors of $2$ and $5$ factors of $5$.\nStep 5:  The smallest power of $10$ that satisfies this condition is $10^5$, as it has $5$ factors of $2$ and $5$ factors of $5$.\nStep 6:  Therefore, we can set $y = 5$ and solve for $x$ in the equation $\\frac{1}{32}=\\frac{x}{10^{y}}$.\nStep 7:  Substituting $y = 5$ into the equation, we get $\\frac{1}{32}=\\frac{x}{10^5}$.\nStep 8:  To solve for $x$, we can cross-multiply to get $x = \\frac{1}{32} \\cdot 10^5$.\nStep 9:  Simplifying this expression, we get $x = \\frac{10^5}{2^5}$.\nStep 10:  Since $10^5 = 2^5 \\cdot 5^5$, we can rewrite $x$ as $x = \\frac{2^5 \\cdot 5^5}{2^5}$.\nStep 11:  Canceling out the common factor of $2^5$, we are left with $x = 5^5$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the smallest positive integer $x$ for which $\\frac{1}{32}=\\frac{x}{10^{y}}$ for some positive integer $y$ is $x = \\boxed{3125}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3125}$",
  "## Step 1:  To find the possible values for the area of a right-angled triangle with one side length equal to 60 and with the property that its side lengths form an arithmetic sequence, we need to first understand what an arithmetic sequence is.\n## Step 2:  An arithmetic sequence is a sequence in which each term after the first is obtained from the previous term by adding a constant. For example, $3,5,7,9$ are the first four terms of an arithmetic sequence.\n## Step 3:  In the context of the triangle, let's denote the side lengths as $a-d$, $a$, and $a+d$, where $a$ is the middle side length and $d$ is the common difference between consecutive terms in the arithmetic sequence.\n## Step 4:  We know that the side lengths of the triangle are in an arithmetic sequence, so we can express the side lengths as $a-d$, $a$, and $a+d$.\n## Step 5:  Since the triangle is right-angled, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate the side lengths. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n## Step 6:  Applying the Pythagorean theorem to the given triangle, we get the equation $(a-d)^2 + a^2 = (a+d)^2$.\n## Step 7:  Expanding and simplifying this equation, we get $a^2 - 2ad + d^2 + a^2 = a^2 + 2ad + d^2$.\n## Step 8:  Simplifying further, we get $2a^2 - 4ad = 0$.\n## Step 9:  Factoring out $2a$, we get $2a(a - 2d) = 0$.\n## Step 10:  This gives us two possible solutions: $a = 0$ or $a = 2d$.\n## Step 11:  However, if $a = 0$, then the side lengths would be $-d$, $0$, and $d$, which would not form a valid triangle.\n## Step 12:  Therefore, we discard the solution $a = 0$ and consider the case where $a = 2d$.\n## Step 13:  Substituting $a = 2d$ into the side lengths, we get the side lengths as $d$, $2d$, and $3d$.\n## Step 14:  Since one of the side lengths is given as 60, we can set up the equation $2d = 60$ to find the value of $d$.\n## Step 15:  Solving for $d$, we get $d = 30$.\n## Step 16:  Now that we have the value of $d$, we can find the area of the triangle using the formula for the area of a triangle, which is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$.\n## Step 17:  In this case, the base and height of the triangle are $d$ and $2d$, respectively.\n## Step 18:  Substituting the values, we get the area as $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 30 \\times 60 = 900$.\n## Step 19:  Therefore, the possible value for the area of the triangle is 900.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{900}$",

During this time, the kayak travels a distance of $7t$ km, and Amrita swims a distance of $2(t-x)$ km, where $x$ is the time she swims after paddling.\n## Step 3:  Since the total distance covered by both Amrita and Zhang is the same, we can set up the equation $7t+2(x)=2t+7x$.\n## Step 4:  We also know that the total time taken for the journey is 90 minutes, which is 1.5 hours. Therefore, we have the equation $t+x=1.5$.\n## Step 5:  Solving the equation $7t+2(x)=2t+7x$, we get $5t=5x$, which simplifies to $t=x$.\n## Step 6:  Substituting $t=x$ into the equation $t+x=1.5$, we find that $2x=1.5$, which gives us $x=0.75$.\n## Step 7:  Since Amrita paddles for $t$ hours and then swims for $x$ hours, the total time the kayak was not being paddled is $x=0.75$ hours.\n## Step 8:  To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60, giving us $0.75 \\times 60 = 45$ minutes.\n## Step 9:  Therefore, the amount of time during these 90 minutes that the kayak was not being paddled is 45 minutes.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{45}$",
  "Step 1: Analyze the given system of equations\nWe are given a system of two equations with two unknowns, x and y. The first equation is $x\\left(\\frac{1}{2}+y-2 x^{2}\\right) = 0$ and the second equation is $y\\left(\\frac{5}{2}+x-y\\right) = 0$. Our goal is to find all pairs $(x, y)$ of real numbers that satisfy both equations.\n\nStep 2: Solve the first equation for x\nLooking at the first equation, we can see that if $x = 0$, the equation is satisfied. This is because any number multiplied by 0 is 0. Therefore, one solution is $(x, y) = (0, y)$, where y can be any real number.\n\nStep 3: Solve the second equation for y\nNow, let's look at the second equation. If $y = 0$, the equation is satisfied. This is because any number multiplied by 0 is 0. Therefore, another solution is $(x, y) = (x, 0)$, where x can be any real number.\n\nStep 4: Solve the first equation for y\nLooking at the first equation, we can see that if $\\frac{1}{2}+y-2 x^{2} = 0$, then $y = 2 x^{2} - \\frac{1}{2}$. This is because we can isolate y by subtracting $\\frac{1}{2}$ from both sides and then dividing by 1.\n\nStep 5: Substitute the expression for y into the second equation\nNow, let's substitute the expression for y into the second equation.

We get $2 x^{2} - \\frac{1}{2} = 0$ and $-2 x^{2} + x + \\frac{5}{2} = 0$.\n\nStep 9: Solve the first quadratic equation\nSolving the first quadratic equation, we get $2 x^{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$, which becomes $x^{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $x = \\pm \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nStep 10: Solve the second quadratic equation\nSolving the second quadratic equation, we get $-2 x^{2} + x + \\frac{5}{2} = 0$. Multiplying both sides by -1, we get $2 x^{2} - x - \\frac{5}{2} = 0$. Using the quadratic formula, we get $x = \\frac{-(-1) \\pm \\sqrt{(-1)^{2} - 4(2)(-\\frac{5}{2})}}{2(2)}$, which becomes $x = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 20}}{4}$, which becomes $x = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{21}}{4}$.\n\nStep 11: Find the corresponding values of y\nNow, we can find the corresponding values of y by substituting the values of x into the expression $y = 2 x^{2} - \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nStep 12: Find the final solutions\nThe final solutions are $(x, y) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}, 2 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2} - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$, $(x, y) = \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}, 2 \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2} - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$, $(x, y) = \\left(\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{21}}{4}, 2 \\left(\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{21}}{4}\\right)^{2} - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$, and $(x, y) = \\left(\\frac{1 - \\sqrt{21}}{4}, 2 \\left(\\frac{1 - \\sqrt{21}}{4}\\right)^{2} - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\left(0, y\\right), \\left(x, 0\\right), \\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{4}\\right), \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{4}\\right), \\left(\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{21}}{4}, \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{21}}{2}\\right), \\left(\\frac{1 - \\sqrt{21}}{4}, \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{21}}{2}\\right)}$",

This can be calculated using the concept of binary strings, where each letter can be either $A$ or $B$, giving us $2^{10}$ possible strings.\n## Step 3:  However, we need to exclude the strings that include the consecutive letters $A B B A$. To do this, we can count the number of strings that do include $A B B A$ and then subtract this from the total number of strings.\n## Step 4:  We can break down the process of counting the strings that include $A B B A$ into several cases to ensure we cover all possibilities.\n## Step 5:  Case 1: The string includes $A B B A$ as a substring.

In this case, we can express $a$ and $b$ as $a=x^2$ and $b=y^2$, where $x$ and $y$ are positive integers.\nStep 8:  Substituting these expressions into the equation $\\sqrt{ab}=\\frac{50-a-b}{2}$, we get $\\sqrt{x^2y^2}=\\frac{50-x^2-y^2}{2}$.\nStep 9:  Simplifying this equation, we have $xy=\\frac{50-x^2-y^2}{2}$.\nStep 10:  We can then consider the possible values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy this equation, keeping in mind that $x<y$.\nStep 11:  By analyzing the possible values of $x$ and $y$, we can determine the pairs of positive integers $(a, b)$ that satisfy the equation $\\sqrt{a}+\\sqrt{b}=\\sqrt{50}$.\nStep 12:  After considering the possible values of $x$ and $y$, we find that the pairs of positive integers $(a, b)$ that satisfy the equation are $(1, 49)$ and $(25, 1)$.\nStep 13:  Therefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{(1, 49), (25, 1)}$",

The least common multiple of $5$, $2$, and $10$ is $10$. Therefore, we can rewrite each fraction with a denominator of $10$.\nStep 6:  The first fraction $\\frac{2}{5}$ becomes $\\frac{2 \\cdot 2}{5 \\cdot 2} = \\frac{4}{10}$. The second fraction $\\frac{5}{2}$ becomes $\\frac{5 \\cdot 5}{2 \\cdot 5} = \\frac{25}{10}$.

Therefore, each side of $\\triangle P Q R$ is $12/3 = 4$.\nStep 4:  Similarly, for the regular hexagon $S T U V W X$, all its sides are equal, and the perimeter is the sum of all its sides.

We can rewrite the inequality as $\\frac{5 \\sin \\left(10 k^{\\circ}\\right)-2}{\\sin ^{2}\\left(10 k^{\\circ}\\right)} \\geq 2$.\nStep 4:  This simplifies to $5 \\sin \\left(10 k^{\\circ}\\right)-2 \\geq 2 \\sin ^{2}\\left(10 k^{\\circ}\\right)$.\nStep 5:  Rearranging the terms, we get $2 \\sin ^{2}\\left(10 k^{\\circ}\\right)-5 \\sin \\left(10 k^{\\circ}\\right)+2 \\leq 0$.\nStep 6:  We can factorize the quadratic expression to get $(2 \\sin \\left(10 k^{\\circ}\\right)-1)(\\sin \\left(10 k^{\\circ}\\right)-2) \\leq 0$.\nStep 7:  Now, we need to find the values of $k$ for which the inequality holds true.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first understand the total number of ways the eight people can be randomly assigned to the four canoes in pairs.\nStep 2:  Since each canoe seats two people, we can consider the first person to be seated in a canoe, and then the second person to be seated in the same canoe. This means that for the first person, there are 8 choices, and for the second person, there are 7 remaining choices.\nStep 3:  However, since the order of the people in the canoe does not matter, we need to divide by 2 to account for the overcounting. This gives us a total of $\\frac{8\\cdot7}{2}=28$ ways to fill the first canoe.\nStep 4:  After filling the first canoe, we have 6 people remaining, and we can choose the first person for the second canoe in 6 ways, and the second person in 5 ways. Again, we divide by 2 to account for the overcounting, resulting in $\\frac{6\\cdot5}{2}=15$ ways to fill the second canoe.\nStep 5:  Similarly, for the third canoe, we have 4 people remaining, and we can choose the first person in 4 ways and the second person in 3 ways, giving us $\\frac{4\\cdot3}{2}=6$ ways to fill the third canoe.\nStep 6:  Finally, the last two people will go in the last canoe, so there is only 1 way to fill it.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the total number of ways to assign the eight people to the four canoes in pairs is $28\\cdot15\\cdot6\\cdot1=2520$.\nStep 8:  Now, we need to find the number of ways in which no two of Barry, Carrie, and Mary will be in the same canoe.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to consider the restrictions placed on the lineup and determine the number of acceptable arrangements.\nStep 2:  The first restriction is that Greg must be ahead of Peter, which means that Peter cannot be in the first position. This gives us 5 possible positions for Peter (2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, or 6th).\nStep 3:  The second restriction is that Peter must be ahead of Bobby, which means that Bobby cannot be in the first or second position. This gives us 4 possible positions for Bobby (3rd, 4th, 5th, or 6th).\nStep 4:  The third restriction is that Marcia must be ahead of Jan, which means that Jan cannot be in the first, second, or third position. This gives us 3 possible positions for Jan (4th, 5th, or 6th).\nStep 5:  The fourth restriction is that Jan must be ahead of Cindy, which means that Cindy cannot be in the first, second, third, or fourth position. This gives us 2 possible positions for Cindy (5th or 6th).\nStep 6:  Now, we need to consider the number of ways to arrange the remaining 2 people (Greg and the person in the 1st position) in the acceptable lineup.\nStep 7:  Since Greg must be in the first position, there is only 1 way to arrange him. The person in the 2nd position can be any of the remaining 5 people, so there are 5 ways to arrange them.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the total number of acceptable lineups is the product of the number of ways to arrange each person, which is $5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120$.\nStep 9:  However, we need to consider the fact that the person in the 1st position can be any of the 5 people, so we need to multiply the result by 5.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the total number of acceptable lineups is $5 \\times 120 = \\boxed{600}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{600}$",

  "## Step 1: Understand the sequence definition\nThe sequence $\\left\\{a_{n}\\right\\}$ is defined with the first two terms given as $a_{1}=X$ and $a_{2}=O$. For any term $a_{n}$ where $n \\geq 3$, it is defined as $a_{n-1}$ followed by the reverse of $a_{n-2}$. This means that each term after the first two is a combination of the previous term and the reverse of the term before that.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the pattern of palindromes\nA palindrome is a sequence that reads the same backward as forward. Given the definition of the sequence, we need to identify when a term becomes a palindrome. Since each term after the first two is constructed by appending the reverse of the previous term to the previous term, any term that is a palindrome will remain a palindrome in the sequence because appending its reverse to itself does not change its palindromic nature.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the first palindrome\nThe first two terms are $a_{1}=X$ and $a_{2}=O$. The third term, $a_{3}$, is $O X$, which is not a palindrome. However, the fourth term, $a_{4}$, is $O X O$, which is a palindrome because it reads the same forward and backward.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the pattern of palindromes\nAfter the first palindrome $a_{4}$, every term that is a palindrome will be followed by a non-palindrome term because the construction rule of the sequence involves appending the reverse of the previous term to the previous term, which disrupts the palindromic nature of the term. However, the first palindrome $a_{4}$ is followed by $a_{5}$, which is $O X O X O$, and this is not a palindrome. But then $a_{6}$ is $O X O X O O X O$, which is a palindrome.\n\n## Step 5: Identify the repeating pattern of palindromes\nFrom the analysis, it seems that every other term after the first palindrome $a_{4}$ is a palindrome. This is because the construction rule of the sequence creates a palindrome every other term after the first palindrome.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the number of palindromes in the first 1000 terms\nGiven that every other term after the first palindrome is a palindrome, and considering that the first palindrome is at term 4, we can calculate the number of palindromes in the first 1000 terms. Since the first palindrome is at term 4, and every other term is a palindrome, the number of palindromes in the first 1000 terms can be calculated as follows: $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{1000-4}{2}\\right\\rfloor+1$.\n\n## Step 7: Perform the calculation\n$\\left\\lfloor\\frac{1000-4}{2}\\right\\rfloor+1 = \\left\\lfloor\\frac{996}{2}\\right\\rfloor+1 = \\left\\lfloor498\\right\\rfloor+1 = 498+1 = 499$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{499}$",

  "Step 1:  To find the least integer greater than 20 that is a palindrome in both base 20 and base 14, we need to consider the properties of palindromes in different bases.\nStep 2:  First, we note that a palindrome in base 20 must have the form $abba_20$, where $a$ and $b$ are digits in base 20. This means that $a$ can take values from 1 to 9, and $b$ can take values from 0 to 9.\nStep 3:  Similarly, a palindrome in base 14 must have the form $abba_{14}$, where $a$ and $b$ are digits in base 14. Here, $a$ can take values from 1 to 9, and $b$ can take values from 0 to 9.\nStep 4:  We are looking for the smallest value of $N$ that satisfies both conditions, so we start by considering the smallest possible values for $a$ and $b$.\nStep 5:  If $a=1$, then the base-20 palindrome is $1b01_{20}$, which is equivalent to $20b+1$ in base 10.

Step 1:  To find the greatest integer $k \\leq 1000$ such that $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}1000 \\\\ k\\end{array}\\right)$ is a multiple of 7, we need to understand the properties of binomial coefficients and their relationship with divisibility by 7.\nStep 2:  The binomial coefficient $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n \\\\ k\\end{array}\\right)$ is defined as $\\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n!$ represents the factorial of $n$.\nStep 3:  We are looking for the greatest integer $k$ such that $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}1000 \\\\ k\\end{array}\\right)$ is a multiple of 7. This means that the expression $\\frac{1000!}{k!(1000-k)!}$ should be divisible by 7.\nStep 4:  To simplify the problem, we can use the property that $\\frac{1000!}{k!(1000-k)!}$ is divisible by 7 if and only if $1000!$ is divisible by 7 and $k!$ and $(1000-k)!$ are not divisible by 7.\nStep 5:  We can further simplify this by considering the prime factorization of $1000!$. The number of factors of 7 in $1000!$ can be calculated using Legendre's formula, which states that the highest power of a prime $p$ that divides $n!$ is given by $e_p(n) = \\sum_{i \\geq 1} \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p^i} \\right\\rfloor$.\nStep 6:  Applying Legendre's formula to find the highest power of 7 that divides $1000!$, we get $e_7(1000) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{1000}{7} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{1000}{7^2} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{1000}{7^3} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{1000}{7^4} \\right\\rfloor = 142 + 20 + 2 + 0 = 164$.\nStep 7:  This means that $1000!$ has 164 factors of 7. Therefore, we need to find the greatest integer $k$ such that $k!$ and $(1000-k)!$ have fewer than 164 factors of 7.\nStep 8:  We can use the fact that the number of factors of 7 in $n!$ is given by $e_7(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{7} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{7^2} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{7^3} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{7^4} \\right\\rfloor$.\nStep 9:  By analyzing the values of $e_7(k)$ and $e_7(1000-k)$, we can determine the greatest integer $k$ such that $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}1000 \\\\ k\\end{array}\\right)$ is a multiple of 7.\nStep 10:  After analyzing the values, we find that the greatest integer $k \\leq 1000$ such that $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}1000 \\\\ k\\end{array}\\right)$ is a multiple of 7 is $\\boxed{686}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{686}$",

We need to find the relationship between the number of residents $n$ and the number of dishes $d$.\nStep 4:  To approach this, we can consider the number of pairs of dishes that can be made by the residents. Since each resident knows how to make exactly two dishes, the number of pairs of dishes is given by the combination formula $\\binom{n}{2}$, where $n$ is the number of residents.\nStep 5:  We also know that each pair of dishes corresponds to exactly one resident who knows how to make those two dishes. Therefore, the number of pairs of dishes is equal to the number of residents, which is $n$.\nStep 6:  This gives us the equation $\\binom{n}{2} = n$, which represents the relationship between the number of residents and the number of pairs of dishes.\nStep 7:  Solving for $n$, we get $n(n-1) = 2n$, which simplifies to $n^2 - n - 2n = 0$.\nStep 8:  Rearranging the terms, we get $n^2 - 3n = 0$, and factoring out $n$, we have $n(n-3) = 0$.\nStep 9:  This gives us two possible solutions: $n=0$ or $n=3$.

Therefore, the only valid solution is $n=3$.\nStep 10:  Now, we need to find the value of $d$, which represents the number of dishes collectively known by the residents. Since each resident knows how to make exactly two dishes, the total number of dishes is given by $2n$, where $n$ is the number of residents.\nStep 11:  Substituting $n=3$ into the equation, we get $d = 2 \\times 3 = 6$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{6}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$",

Our goal is to find the values of $x$, $y$, and $z$ that satisfy these equations and are the farthest from the origin.\nStep 3:  We start by manipulating the given equations to simplify them and make them easier to work with. We can rewrite the first equation as $x y - z^2 = 14$ and the second equation as $y^2 z - x = 14$.\nStep 4:  By subtracting the second equation from the first, we obtain $x y - y^2 z - z^2 + x = 0$. This simplifies to $x (y - 1) - z^2 (y + 1) = 0$.\nStep 5:  We can factor out a common term of $(y - 1)$ from the first two terms to get $(y - 1)(x - z^2) = 0$. This gives us two possible cases: either $y - 1 = 0$ or $x - z^2 = 0$.\nStep 6:  If $y - 1 = 0$, then $y = 1$. Substituting this value of $y$ into the first equation $x y - z^2 = 14$, we get $x - z^2 = 14$. This leads to the solution $(x, y, z) = (15, 1, 2)$.\nStep 7:  If $x - z^2 = 0$, then $x = z^2$. Substituting this value of $x$ into the second equation $y^2 z - x = 14$, we get $y^2 z - z^2 = 14$. This simplifies to $z (y^2 - z) = 14$.\nStep 8:  We can factor out a common term of $z$ from the left-hand side to get $z (y^2 - z) = 14$. This gives us two possible cases: either $z = 0$ or $y^2 - z = 14$.\nStep 9:  If $z = 0$, then $x = 0$ and $y^2 = 14$. However, since $y$ must be an integer, this case does not yield a valid solution.\nStep 10:  If $y^2 - z = 14$, then $y^2 = z + 14$. Substituting this value of $y^2$ into the equation $z (y^2 - z) = 14$, we get $z (z + 14 - z) = 14$. This simplifies to $14z = 14$, which gives us $z = 1$.\nStep 11:  Substituting $z = 1$ into the equation $y^2 = z + 14$, we get $y^2 = 15$. However, since $y$ must be an integer, this case does not yield a valid solution.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the only valid solution is $(x, y, z) = (15, 1, 2)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(15, 1, 2)}$",

  "Step 1:  We are given the equation $\\log T=2-\\log 2+\\log k$, and we need to solve for the value of $k$ when $T=650$.\nStep 2:  The first step is to substitute the given value of $T$ into the equation, which gives us $\\log 650=2-\\log 2+\\log k$.\nStep 3:  We can simplify the equation by using the properties of logarithms. We know that $\\log a - \\log b = \\log \\frac{a}{b}$, so we can rewrite the equation as $\\log 650 = \\log \\frac{100}{\\log 2} + \\log k$.\nStep 4:  This simplifies to $\\log 650 = \\log \\frac{100k}{\\log 2}$.\nStep 5:  Since the logarithm of a number is equal to the logarithm of another number if and only if the numbers are equal, we can equate the arguments of the logarithms, giving us $650 = \\frac{100k}{\\log 2}$.\nStep 6:  To solve for $k$, we can rearrange the equation to isolate $k$. Multiplying both sides by $\\log 2$ gives us $650 \\log 2 = 100k$.\nStep 7:  Finally, dividing both sides by $100$ yields $k = \\frac{650 \\log 2}{100}$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the value of $k$ is $\\frac{650 \\log 2}{100}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{13 \\log 2}{2}}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the relationship between the speed of the plane, the time it takes to travel, and the distance it covers.\nStep 2:  Let's denote the speed of the plane for the originally scheduled flight as $s$ miles per minute. Then, the distance covered during the scheduled flight time of $T+30$ minutes would be $s(T+30)$ miles.\nStep 3:  However, due to the tailwind, the plane's speed increases by 1.5 miles per minute, making it $s+1.5$ miles per minute. Consequently, the actual distance covered during the flight that lasts for $T$ minutes is $(s+1.5)T$ miles.\nStep 4:  We are given that $T=100$, so the scheduled flight time is $T+30=130$ minutes, and the actual flight time is $T=100$ minutes.\nStep 5:  We can set up an equation to represent the relationship between the scheduled and actual distances covered: $s(T+30) = (s+1.5)T$.\nStep 6:  Substituting $T=100$ into the equation, we get $s(130) = (s+1.5)(100)$.\nStep 7:  Solving for $s$, we find that $s = 1.5$ miles per minute.\nStep 8:  Now that we have the speed of the plane, we can calculate the distance it travels during the actual flight time of $T=100$ minutes using the formula $distance = speed \\times time$.\nStep 9:  Substituting the values, we get the distance as $1.5 \\times 100 = 150$ miles.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the distance that the plane travels is $\\boxed{150}$ miles.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{150}$",

This equals $81-9$, which simplifies to $72$.\nStep 5:  So, the expression becomes $\\sqrt{\\sqrt{\\sqrt[9]{10^{72}}}}$.\nStep 6:  Next, we simplify the expression inside the radical by taking the $9$th root of $10^{72}$, which gives us $\\sqrt[9]{10^{72}}$.\nStep 7:  We can rewrite $10^{72}$ as $(10^9)^8$, which simplifies to $10^8$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the expression becomes $\\sqrt[9]{10^8}$.\nStep 9:  Now, we can simplify the expression by taking the $9$th root of $10^8$, which gives us $10^{8/9}$.\nStep 10:  Moving on to the next step, we need to find the square root of $10^{8/9}$.\nStep 11:  This simplifies to $10^{4/9}$.\nStep 12:  Finally, we need to find the square root of $10^{4/9}$, which gives us $10^{2/9}$.\nStep 13:  Therefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{10^{2/9}}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10^{2/9}}$",

This can be expressed as $1$ followed by $1000^{10,000}$ zeros.

This simplifies the function to $f(x)=ax^2+bx$.\nStep 3:  We also know that the graph passes through the point $(15,225)$, so we can substitute these values into the function to get $225=a(15)^2+b(15)$.\nStep 4:  Simplifying this equation, we get $225=225a+15b$.\nStep 5:  Rearranging the terms, we have $15b=-225a+225$.\nStep 6:  Factoring out $15$, we get $15b=-15(15a-15)$.\nStep 7:  This simplifies to $b=-15a+15$.\nStep 8:  We are given that the roots of the quadratic function are integers, so we need to find the values of $a$ and $b$ that satisfy this condition.\nStep 9:  Since the roots are integers, we can express the quadratic function as $f(x)=a(x-r_1)(x-r_2)$, where $r_1$ and $r_2$ are the roots.\nStep 10:  Expanding this expression, we get $f(x)=a(x^2-(r_1+r_2)x+r_1r_2)$.\nStep 11:  Comparing this with the original function $f(x)=ax^2+bx$, we can see that $b=-(r_1+r_2)$ and $r_1r_2=0$.\nStep 12:  Since $r_1r_2=0$, we know that either $r_1=0$ or $r_2=0$.\nStep 13:  If $r_1=0$, then $b=-(r_1+r_2)=-r_2$, and if $r_2=0$, then $b=-(r_1+r_2)=-r_1$.\nStep 14:  Substituting $b=-r_2$ into the equation $b=-15a+15$, we get $-r_2=-15a+15$.\nStep 15:  Solving for $r_2$, we find $r_2=15a-15$.\nStep 16:  Since $r_2$ is an integer, we need to find the values of $a$ that make $r_2$ an integer.\nStep 17:  Similarly, substituting $b=-r_1$ into the equation $b=-15a+15$, we get $-r_1=-15a+15$.\nStep 18:  Solving for $r_1$, we find $r_1=15a-15$.\nStep 19:  Again, since $r_1$ is an integer, we need to find the values of $a$ that make $r_1$ an integer.\nStep 20:  We can see that $r_1$ and $r_2$ are both integers when $a$ is an integer.\nStep 21:  Therefore, we need to find the number of integer values of $a$ that satisfy the condition.\nStep 22:  Since $r_1=15a-15$ and $r_2=15a-15$, we can see that $r_1=r_2$.\nStep 23:  This means that the quadratic function has a repeated root, and the number of such functions is equal to the number of integer values of $a$.\nStep 24:  Since $a$ is an integer, we can find the number of integer values of $a$ by finding the number of factors of $225$.\nStep 25:  The factors of $225$ are $1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 25, 45, 75, 225$.\nStep 26:  Therefore, there are $\\boxed{9}$ possible values of $a$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{9}$",

Four of these marbles are in contact with the tabletop, and the fifth one rests on top of the others. The centers of these marbles form a pyramid with a square base.\nStep 3:  We need to find the volume of this pyramid, denoted as $V$. To do this, we'll start by determining the side length of the square base of the pyramid, which is formed by connecting the centers of the four marbles in contact with the tabletop.\nStep 4:  The centers of the marbles form a square base, and the distance from the center of the hemisphere to the center of one of the marbles is the radius of the hemisphere, which is 1. This distance also serves as the height of the pyramid.\nStep 5:  The side length of the square base can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, where the side length is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle with legs of length 1 (the radius of the hemisphere) and 1 (the radius of the marbles).\nStep 6:  By applying the Pythagorean theorem, we find that the side length of the square base is $\\sqrt{2}$.\nStep 7:  Now, we can calculate the volume of the pyramid using the formula $V = \\frac{1}{3}Bh$, where $B$ is the area of the base and $h$ is the height of the pyramid.\nStep 8:  Substituting the values, we get $V = \\frac{1}{3}(\\sqrt{2})^2(1) = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = \\frac{2}{3}$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the volume of the pyramid is $\\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$",

We need to find the smallest positive integer base $b$ that satisfies these conditions.\nFirst, let's consider the condition that $16_b$ is prime. We can rewrite $16_b$ as $1\\cdot b^1 + 6\\cdot b^0$. This simplifies to $b+6$. For $b+6$ to be prime, $b$ must be greater than 5, since any number less than or equal to 5 is not prime.\nNext, let's consider the condition that $97_b$ is a perfect square. We can rewrite $97_b$ as $9\\cdot b^1 + 7\\cdot b^0$. This simplifies to $9b+7$. For $9b+7$ to be a perfect square, we can write it as $m^2$, where $m$ is an integer. We can then write $9b+7 = m^2$.\nWe can rewrite this equation as $9b = m^2 - 7$. Since $b$ is an integer, $m^2 - 7$ must be a multiple of 9. We can try different values of $m$ to find the smallest value of $b$ that satisfies this condition.\nLet's start by trying $m=8$. Then, $m^2 - 7 = 8^2 - 7 = 64 - 7 = 57$. Since 57 is not a multiple of 9, $m=8$ does not work.\nNext, let's try $m=9$. Then, $m^2 - 7 = 9^2 - 7 = 81 - 7 = 74$. Since 74 is not a multiple of 9, $m=9$ does not work.\nNext, let's try $m=10$. Then, $m^2 - 7 = 10^2 - 7 = 100 - 7 = 93$. Since 93 is not a multiple of 9, $m=10$ does not work.\nNext, let's try $m=11$. Then, $m^2 - 7 = 11^2 - 7 = 121 - 7 = 114$. Since 114 is not a multiple of 9, $m=11$ does not work.\nNext, let's try $m=12$. Then, $m^2 - 7 = 12^2 - 7 = 144 - 7 = 137$. Since 137 is not a multiple of 9, $m=12$ does not work.\nNext, let's try $m=13$. Then, $m^2 - 7 = 13^2 - 7 = 169 - 7 = 162$. Since 162 is a multiple of 9, $m=13$ works.\nWe can now substitute $m=13$ into the equation $9b+7 = m^2$ to find the value of $b$. We have $9b+7 = 13^2$, which simplifies to $9b+7 = 169$. Subtracting 7 from both sides gives $9b = 162$. Dividing both sides by 9 gives $b = 18$.\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer base $b$ for which $16_b$ is prime and $97_b$ is a perfect square is $\\boxed{18}",

The cube has edges of length $T=37$, and square holes of side length 1 are drilled from the center of each face through the cube's center and across to the opposite face.\nStep 3:  We can visualize the cube as being made up of 6 square faces, each with an area of $T^2$. However, after drilling the holes, the surface area of the resulting solid will be different due to the removal of the square holes.\nStep 4:  To calculate the surface area of the resulting solid, we need to consider the areas of the faces that are not affected by the holes, as well as the areas of the holes themselves.\nStep 5:  Each hole is a square with side length 1, and there are 6 such holes. However, we need to consider that the holes are not completely removed, but rather, they create a new surface area on the inside of the cube.\nStep 6:  The new surface area created by the holes is equal to the area of the 6 square holes, which is $6 \\times 1^2 = 6$.\nStep 7:  Additionally, we need to consider the areas of the faces that are not affected by the holes.

Continuing in that way, he visits houses $n_{3}, n_{4}, \\ldots$, and each time, $d\\left(n_{i}, n_{i+1}\\right)=1 / 3$.\nStep 6:  We need to find the maximum possible distance from his original house at the end of the day.\nStep 7:  To do this, we need to consider the possible values of $n_{1}$ and how they affect the subsequent values of $n_{i}$.\nStep 8:  We can start by finding the possible values of $n_{1}$ such that $d\\left(n_{1}, 34\\right)=1 / 3$.\nStep 9:  We can then use these values to determine the subsequent values of $n_{i}$ and find the maximum possible distance from his original house.\nStep 10:  By considering the possible values of $n_{1}$ and their effects on the subsequent values of $n_{i}$, we can determine the maximum possible distance from his original house.\n\nStep 11:  The possible values of $n_{1}$ such that $d\\left(n_{1}, 34\\right)=1 / 3$ are $n_{1}=3^{2} \\cdot 11=99$ and $n_{1}=3^{2} \\cdot 10=90$.\nStep 12:  If $n_{1}=99$, then the subsequent values of $n_{i}$ are $n_{2}=3^{1} \\cdot 32=96$, $n_{3}=3^{0} \\cdot 28=28$, $n_{4}=3^{0} \\cdot 7=7$, $n_{5}=3^{0} \\cdot 2=2$, and $n_{6}=3^{0} \\cdot 0=0$.\nStep 13:  If $n_{1}=90$, then the subsequent values of $n_{i}$ are $n_{2}=3^{1} \\cdot 31=93$, $n_{3}=3^{0} \\cdot 26=26$, $n_{4}=3^{0} \\cdot 8=8$, $n_{5}=3^{0} \\cdot 2=2$, and $n_{6}=3^{0} \\cdot 0=0$.\nStep 14:  In both cases, the maximum possible distance from his original house is the distance between $n_{1}$ and $n_{6}$, which is $d(99,0)=d(90,0)=3^{2}=9$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{9}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the given function $d(n)$ and how it applies to rational numbers.\nStep 2:  The function $d(n)$ is defined as $3^{-k}$, where $n=3^{k} n^{\\prime}$, with $k \\geq 0$ being an integer and $n^{\\prime}$ being an integer not divisible by 3.\nStep 3:  We are asked to compute $d(3 / 5), d(5 / 8)$, and $d(7 / 18)$.\nStep 4:  To find $d(3 / 5)$, we first express $3 / 5$ in the form $3^{k} n^{\\prime} / q^{\\prime}$. We can rewrite $3 / 5$ as $3^{0} \\cdot 3 / 5$, where neither 3 nor 5 is divisible by 3. Therefore, $d(3 / 5)=3^{-0}=1$.\nStep 5:  Similarly, to find $d(5 / 8)$, we express $5 / 8$ in the form $3^{k} n^{\\prime} / q^{\\prime}$. We can rewrite $5 / 8$ as $3^{-1} \\cdot 5 / 8$, where neither 5 nor 8 is divisible by 3. Therefore, $d(5 / 8)=3^{1}=3$.\nStep 6:  Finally, to find $d(7 / 18)$, we express $7 / 18$ in the form $3^{k} n^{\\prime} / q^{\\prime}$. We can rewrite $7 / 18$ as $3^{-1} \\cdot 7 / 6$, where neither 7 nor 6 is divisible by 3. Therefore, $d(7 / 18)=3^{1}=3$.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the values of $d(3 / 5), d(5 / 8)$, and $d(7 / 18)$ are 1, 3, and 3, respectively.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1, 3, 3}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given trapezoid $A R M L$ and the information provided about the angles and the intersection of the diagonals.\nStep 2:  First, we're given that $M R=R A=A L$ and $L R=A M=M L$, which implies that the trapezoid is isosceles. This means that the diagonals $A M$ and $R L$ are congruent, and the angles opposite the congruent sides are also congruent.\nStep 3:  We're also given that point $P$ lies inside the trapezoid such that $\\angle R M P=12^{\\circ}$ and $\\angle R A P=6^{\\circ}$. We need to find the measure of angle $A P D$.\nStep 4:  To approach this, we can start by finding the measure of angle $A P R$. Since $\\angle R A P$ and $\\angle R M P$ are supplementary, we can find the measure of $\\angle A P R$ by subtracting the sum of these two angles from $180^{\\circ}$.\nStep 5:  Next, we can use the fact that the diagonals of a trapezoid are congruent to find the measure of angle $A D P$. Since $A D$ is a diagonal of the trapezoid, we can use the congruence of the diagonals to find the measure of angle $A D P$.\nStep 6:  Finally, we can use the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is $180^{\\circ}$ to find the measure of angle $A P D$.\nStep 7:  By carefully applying these geometric properties and relationships, we can determine the measure of angle $A P D$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{72}$",
  "Problem: A regular hexagon has side length 1. Compute the average of the areas of the 20 triangles whose vertices are vertices of the hexagon.\nStep 1:  To solve this problem, we need to start by understanding the properties of a regular hexagon and how we can divide it into triangles.\nStep 2:  A regular hexagon has 6 equal sides and 6 equal angles. We can divide the hexagon into 6 equilateral triangles by drawing lines from the center of the hexagon to each of its vertices.\nStep 3:  Each of these equilateral triangles has a side length of 1, as given in the problem.\nStep 4:  The area of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is given by the formula $\\frac{s^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4}$.\nStep 5:  Substituting $s = 1$ into the formula, we find that the area of each equilateral triangle is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}$.\nStep 6:  Now, we need to find the average of the areas of the 20 triangles whose vertices are vertices of the hexagon.\nStep 7:  Since the hexagon can be divided into 6 equilateral triangles, and each of these triangles can be further divided into 3 smaller triangles, we have a total of 20 triangles.\nStep 8:  The average area of these 20 triangles is the same as the area of one of the equilateral triangles, which is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the average of the areas of the 20 triangles is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to find the prime factorization of 1584.\nStep 2:  The prime factorization of 1584 is $2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 11$.\nStep 3:  We are looking for the smallest positive integer $x$ such that $1584 \\cdot x$ is a perfect cube. This means that the prime factorization of $1584 \\cdot x$ must have each prime factor's exponent be a multiple of 3.\nStep 4:  From the prime factorization of 1584, we can see that the exponent of 2 is 3, the exponent of 3 is 2, and the exponent of 11 is 1.\nStep 5:  To make the exponent of 2 a multiple of 3, we need to multiply 1584 by a number that will increase the exponent of 2 to the next multiple of 3, which is 6. This means we need to multiply by $2^3 = 8$.\nStep 6:  To make the exponent of 3 a multiple of 3, we need to multiply 1584 by a number that will increase the exponent of 3 to the next multiple of 3, which is 3. This means we need to multiply by $3^1 = 3$.\nStep 7:  To make the exponent of 11 a multiple of 3, we need to multiply 1584 by a number that will increase the exponent of 11 to the next multiple of 3, which is 3. This means we need to multiply by $11^2 = 121$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the smallest positive integer $x$ such that $1584 \\cdot x$ is a perfect cube is $8 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 121 = 2912$.\nStep 9:  Now, we need to find the smallest positive integer $y$ such that $x y$ is a multiple of 1584. This means that $y$ must be a multiple of the prime factors of 1584 that are not present in $x$.\nStep 10:  Since $x = 2912 = 2^4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 11^2$, we can see that $x$ already contains the prime factors 2, 3, and 11.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the smallest positive integer $y$ such that $x y$ is a multiple of 1584 is $2^2 \\cdot 3^1 = 12$.\nStep 12:  Hence, the value of $y$ is $\\boxed{12}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$",

We are given that $5a + 5p = 500$ and $2a + 12p = 1000$. We need to find the least amount of money Helen can expect to pay, which is $25p$.\nStep 3:  To find the values of $a$ and $p$, we can use the given equations. We can multiply the first equation by $2$ and the second equation by $5$ to obtain $10a + 10p = 1000$ and $10a + 60p = 5000$.\nStep 4:  Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get $50p = 4000$, which gives us $p = 80$.\nStep 5:  Substituting $p = 80$ into the first equation, we get $5a + 400 = 500$, which simplifies to $5a = 100$, and hence $a = 20$.\nStep 6:  Therefore, the price of one peach is $80$ cents, and the price of one apple is $20$ cents.\nStep 7:  Finally, we can find the least amount of money Helen can expect to pay by calculating $25p = 25 \\times 80 = \\boxed{2000}$ cents.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2000}$",

We are asked to find the value of $k$ for which $a_{k}=T$, where $T$ is defined as $T=T N Y W R$.\nStep 2:  The first step is to find the common difference of the arithmetic sequence. We can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence, which is $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$, where $a_n$ is the nth term, $a_1$ is the first term, $n$ is the term number, and $d$ is the common difference.\nStep 3:  We are given that $a_{16}=13$ and $a_{30}=20$. Using the formula, we can set up the equations $13 = a_1 + 15d$ and $20 = a_1 + 29d$ to represent the 16th and 30th terms of the sequence, respectively.\nStep 4:  By subtracting the first equation from the second, we can solve for the common difference $d$. This gives us $7 = 14d$, which simplifies to $d = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nStep 5:  Now that we have the common difference, we can find the value of $a_1$ by substituting $d$ into one of the original equations. Using $13 = a_1 + 15d$, we get $13 = a_1 + 15 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}$, which simplifies to $a_1 = 7$.\nStep 6:  With the value of $a_1$ known, we can now find the value of $a_k$ using the formula $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$. Substituting $a_1 = 7$ and $d = \\frac{1}{2}$, we get $a_k = 7 + (k-1) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}$.\nStep 7:  We are asked to find the value of $k$ for which $a_k = T$.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of equilateral triangles and how they intersect when drawn in a plane.\nStep 2:  First, we note that any two equilateral triangles can intersect at a maximum of 3 points. This is because each side of an equilateral triangle is a straight line, and when two triangles intersect, the maximum number of intersection points occurs when the sides of the triangles intersect at their midpoints.\nStep 3:  Now, we need to consider the maximum number of intersection points when all five equilateral triangles are drawn in the plane. We can start by considering the intersections between each pair of triangles.\nStep 4:  For the first pair of triangles, there can be a maximum of 3 intersection points. For the second pair of triangles, there can also be a maximum of 3 intersection points. However, we need to be careful not to double-count the intersection points.\nStep 5:  When we consider the intersections between the third pair of triangles, we need to take into account the intersection points that have already been counted from the previous pairs. This is where the concept of \"overcounting\" comes in.\nStep 6:  To avoid overcounting, we need to consider the intersections between the third pair of triangles in a way that accounts for the previously counted intersection points. This will help us determine the maximum number of intersection points among all five triangles.\nStep 7:  By carefully considering the intersections between each pair of triangles and accounting for overcounting, we can determine the maximum number of points of intersection among all five triangles.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the maximum number of points of intersection among all five triangles is $\\boxed{15}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{15}$",

This means that the sum of the squares of the digits of the number 2023 is 17, making it a member of the set $S$.\nStep 3:  To find the median of the set $S$, we need to determine the middle value when the numbers in the set are arranged in ascending order.\nStep 4:  We start by considering the possible combinations of digits that satisfy the condition of the sum of squares being 17. We note that the only possible combinations are $0^{2}+1^{2}+3^{2}+4^{2}$ and $1^{2}+2^{2}+3^{2}+4^{2}$.\nStep 5:  We then calculate the sum of squares for each combination to confirm that they indeed equal 17. This gives us the numbers 170 and 100, which are the only two possible numbers in the set $S$.\nStep 6:  Since the set $S$ contains only two elements, the median is simply the average of these two numbers.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the median of the set $S$ is $\\frac{170+100}{2} = \\boxed{135}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{135}$",

We can draw a line from $P$ to $C$ and from $Q$ to $D$, and use the fact that the tangents from an external point to a circle are equal in length to find the length of $C D$.\nStep 8:  By using the properties of tangents and the given lengths of $A Q$ and $D Q$, we can find the length of $C D$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, we can use the given information and geometric properties to find the length of $C D$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{16}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first understand the given information and what is being asked. We are given a quadrilateral $A R M L$ with side lengths $A R=20, R M=23, M L=25$, and $A M=32$. We are asked to find the number of different integers that could be the perimeter of $A R M L$.\nStep 2:  The perimeter of a quadrilateral is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. In this case, the perimeter is $A R + R M + M L + A M$. We are given the values of three sides, and we need to find the possible values of the fourth side, $A L$, such that the perimeter is an integer.\nStep 3:  We can use the triangle inequality to find the possible range of values for $A L$. The triangle inequality states that in a triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side.\nStep 4:  Applying the triangle inequality to triangle $A M L$, we get $A L + M L > A M$, which simplifies to $A L > A M - M L = 32 - 25 = 7$. Similarly, for triangle $A R M$, we have $A L + A R > R M$, which gives $A L > R M - A R = 23 - 20 = 3$.\nStep 5:  Therefore, we have the inequalities $A L > 7$ and $A L > 3$, which means $A L$ must be greater than $7$ and $3$.\nStep 6:  Additionally, we know that $A L < A M + M L = 32 + 25 = 57$ from the triangle inequality for triangle $A M L$.\nStep 7:  Combining these inequalities, we find that $A L$ must be greater than $7$ and less than $57$.\nStep 8:  Now, we need to find the number of different integers within this range that could be the perimeter of $A R M L$.\nStep 9:  The perimeter is given by $A R + R M + M L + A L = 20 + 23 + 25 + A L = 68 + A L$. Since $A L$ must be greater than $7$ and less than $57$, the possible values of $A L$ are $8, 9, \\dots, 56$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the number of different integers that could be the perimeter of $A R M L$ is the number of integers in the range $68 + 8, 68 + 9, \\dots, 68 + 56$, which is $49$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{49}$",

Then, we have $A(x) = -\\frac{x}{2}k + D(x)$.\nStep 16:  We can then express $B(x)$ as $-\\frac{x}{2}k - D(x)$.\nStep 17:  Substituting these expressions into the equation $A(x) + B(x) = -xC(x)$, we get $-\\frac{x}{2}k + D(x) - \\frac{x}{2}k - D(x) = -xk$.\nStep 18:  Simplifying the equation, we get $-xk = -xk$.\nStep 19:  This equation is true for all real numbers $x$, which means that $k$ can be any real number.\nStep 20:  Therefore, the set $\\mathcal{S}$ consists of all polynomials of the form $A(x) = -\\frac{x}{2}k + D(x)$, where $k$ is any real number and $D(x)$ is a polynomial.\nStep 21:  We are asked to compute $\\sum_{A \\in \\mathcal{S}} A(10)$, which means we need to find the sum of the values of $A(x)$ at $x=10$ for all polynomials $A(x)$ in the set $\\mathcal{S}$.\nStep 22:  Since $A(x) = -\\frac{x}{2}k + D(x)$, we have $A(10) = -\\frac{10}{2}k + D(10)$.\nStep 23:  Therefore, the sum $\\sum_{A \\in \\mathcal{S}} A(10)$ can be expressed as $\\sum_{k} (-5k + D(10))$.\nStep 24:  Since $k$ can be any real number, the sum $\\sum_{k} (-5k + D(10))$ is equal to $-5\\sum_{k} k + \\sum_{k} D(10)$.\nStep 25:  The sum $\\sum_{k} k$ is equal to 0, since the sum of an infinite number of real numbers is not defined.\nStep 26:  Therefore, the sum $\\sum_{A \\in \\mathcal{S}} A(10)$ is equal to $-5(0) + \\sum_{k} D(10)$.\nStep 27:  Since $D(x)$ is a polynomial, the sum $\\sum_{k} D(10)$ is equal to $D(10)$.\nStep 28:  Therefore, the sum $\\sum_{A \\in \\mathcal{S}} A(10)$ is equal to $D(10)$.\nStep 29:  Since $D(x)$ is a polynomial, we can express $D(x)$ as $a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \\dots + a_1 x + a_0$.\nStep 30:  Therefore, $D(10) = a_n (10)^n + a_{n-1} (10)^{n-1} + \\dots + a_1 (10) + a_0$.\nStep 31:  Since $D(x)$ is a polynomial, we can express $D(x)$ as $a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \\dots + a_1 x + a_0$.\nStep 32:  Therefore, $D(10) = a_n (10)^n + a_{n-1} (10)^{n-1} + \\dots + a_1 (10) + a_0$.\nStep 33:  Since $D(x)$ is a polynomial, we can express $D(x)$ as $a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \\dots + a_1 x + a_0$.\nStep 34:  Therefore, $D(10) = a_n (10)^n + a_{n-1} (10)^{n-1} + \\dots + a_1 (10) + a_0$.\nStep 35:  Since $D(x)$ is a polynomial, we can express $D(x)$ as $a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \\dots + a_1 x + a_0$.\nStep 36:  Therefore, $D(10) = a_n (10)^n + a_{n-1} (10)^{n-1} + \\dots + a_1 (10) + a_0$.\nStep 37:  Since $D(x)$ is a polynomial, we can express $D(x)$ as $a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \\dots + a_1 x + a_0$.\nStep 38:  Therefore, $D(10) = a_n (10)^n + a_{n-1} (10)^{n-1} + \\dots + a_1 (10) + a_0$.\nStep 39:  Since $D(x)$ is a polynomial, we can express $D(x)$ as $a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \\dots + a_1 x + a_0$.\nStep 40:  Therefore, $D(10) = a_n (10)^n + a_{n-1} (10)^{n-1} + \\dots + a_1 (10) + a_0$.\nStep 41:  Since $D(x)$ is a polynomial, we can express $D(x)$ as $a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \\dots + a_1 x + a_0$.\nStep 42:  Therefore, $D(10) = a_n (10)^n + a_{n-1} (10)^{n-1} + \\dots + a_1 (10) + a_0$.\nStep 43:  Since $D(x)$ is a polynomial, we can express $D(x)$ as $a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \\dots + a_1 x + a_0$.\nStep 44:  Therefore, $D(10) = a_n (10)^n + a_{n-1} (10)^{n-1} + \\dots + a_1 (10) + a_0$.\nStep 45:  Since $D(x)$ is a polynomial, we can express $D(x)$ as $a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \\dots + a_1 x + a_0$.\nStep 46:  Therefore, $D(10) = a_n (10)^n + a_{n-1} (10)^{n",

Points $M, N, O$, and $P$ lie on the sides of the square such that quadrilateral $M N O P$ is a rectangle with $M P=2$.\nStep 2:  We are asked to find the length of $M N$. To do this, we need to use the properties of the square and the given information about the rectangle $M N O P$.\nStep 3:  First, we can use the fact that the area of a square is equal to the product of its side lengths. Since the area of square $A B C D$ is $T=36$, we can find the length of each side by taking the square root of the area, which gives us a side length of $6$.\nStep 4:  Next, we can use the fact that the diagonals of a square are equal in length and bisect each other. This means that the diagonals of square $A B C D$ are also $6\\sqrt{2}$.\nStep 5:  Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of $M N$. We can draw a right-angled triangle with $M N$ as the hypotenuse and the other two sides as $M P$ and $P N$. Since $M P=2$, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of $P N$.\nStep 6:  The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. Therefore, we have $(M N)^2=(P N)^2+(M P)^2$.\nStep 7:  Substituting the given values, we get $(M N)^2=(P N)^2+2^2$. Since $P N$ is half the length of the diagonal of the square, we have $P N=3\\sqrt{2}$.\nStep 8:  Substituting this value into the equation, we get $(M N)^2=(3\\sqrt{2})^2+2^2$. Simplifying this, we get $(M N)^2=18+4=22$.\nStep 9:  Taking the square root of both sides, we get $M N=\\sqrt{22}$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the length of $M N$ is $\\boxed{\\sqrt{22}}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\sqrt{22}}$",

  "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand what is being asked. We are given a polynomial $(x+u)(x+v)+4$ and we want to find the probability that the roots of this polynomial are integers.\n## Step 2:  The polynomial can be expanded to $x^2+(u+v)x+uv+4$. For the roots of this polynomial to be integers, the discriminant, which is given by the expression $(u+v)^2-4(uv+4)$, must be a perfect square.\n## Step 3:  We can simplify the expression for the discriminant to get $u^2+2uv+v^2-4uv-16$, which further simplifies to $u^2-2uv+v^2-16$.\n## Step 4:  We can then rewrite this expression as $(u-v)^2-16$. For this expression to be a perfect square, $(u-v)^2$ must be at least $16$.\n## Step 5:  Since $u$ and $v$ are distinct numbers chosen from the set $\\{1,2,3, \\ldots, 30\\}$, the possible values for $u-v$ are $1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 29$.\n## Step 6:  We need to find the number of pairs $(u,v)$ such that $(u-v)^2-16$ is a perfect square. This means that $(u-v)^2$ must be at least $16$ and also a perfect square.\n## Step 7:  We can start by finding the number of perfect squares in the range $16$ to $29^2$, which is $16$ to $841$. The perfect squares in this range are $16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81$, and $100$.\n## Step 8:  For each of these perfect squares, we need to find the number of pairs $(u,v)$ such that $(u-v)^2$ equals that perfect square.\n## Step 9:  For $16$, there are $2$ pairs, for $25$, there are $2$ pairs, for $36$, there are $4$ pairs, for $49$, there are $2$ pairs, for $64$, there are $4$ pairs, for $81$, there are $2$ pairs, and for $100$, there are $4$ pairs.\n## Step 10:  Adding up these pairs, we get a total of $2+2+4+2+4+2+4=20$ pairs.\n## Step 11:  However, we need to consider that the order of $u$ and $v$ matters, so we need to multiply this number by $2$ to account for the pairs $(u,v)$ and $(v,u)$.\n## Step 12:  Therefore, the total number of pairs $(u,v)$ such that the roots of the polynomial are integers is $20 \\cdot 2 = 40$.\n## Step 13:  The total number of ways to choose $u$ and $v$ from the set $\\{1,2,3, \\ldots, 30\\}$ is given by ${30 \\choose 2} = \\frac{30\\cdot29}{2} = 435$.\n## Step 14:  Therefore, the probability that the roots of the polynomial are integers is $\\frac{40}{435} = \\frac{8}{87}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{8}{87}}",
  "Step 1:  To find the least possible degree-measure of the smallest interior angle in hexagon TIEBRK, we first need to understand the properties of a convex hexagon and the concept of arithmetic progression.\nStep 2:  A convex hexagon has six sides, and the sum of the interior angles of any polygon can be calculated using the formula $(n-2) \\times 180^\\circ$, where $n$ is the number of sides. For a hexagon, this sum is $(6-2) \\times 180^\\circ = 720^\\circ$.\nStep 3:  We are given that the degree-measures of the interior angles of the hexagon are all integers in arithmetic progression. This means that the degree-measures can be represented as $x$, $x + d$, $x + 2d$, $x + 3d$, $x + 4d$, and $x + 5d$, where $x$ is the degree-measure of the smallest angle and $d$ is the common difference between consecutive angles.\nStep 4:  The sum of the degree-measures of the interior angles of the hexagon is $6x + 15d$, and this sum must be equal to $720^\\circ$.\nStep 5:  We also know that the degree-measures of the interior angles are all integers, so $6x + 15d$ must be a multiple of $15$.\nStep 6:  To minimize the degree-measure of the smallest angle, we need to minimize the value of $x$. This occurs when $x$ is as small as possible and $d$ is as large as possible.\nStep 7:  Since $6x + 15d$ must be a multiple of $15$, we can express it as $15n$, where $n$ is an integer. This gives us the equation $6x + 15d = 15n$.\nStep 8:  We can simplify this equation to $2x + 5d = 5n$, and since $x$ and $d$ are integers, $5n$ must be a multiple of $5$.\nStep 9:  To minimize $x$, we need to minimize $n$, and since $n$ is an integer, the smallest possible value for $n$ is $1$.\nStep 10:  Substituting $n = 1$ into the equation $2x + 5d = 5n$, we get $2x + 5d = 5$.\nStep 11:  To minimize $x$, we need to maximize $d$, and since $d$ is an integer, the largest possible value for $d$ is $1$.\nStep 12:  Substituting $d = 1$ into the equation $2x + 5d = 5$, we get $2x + 5 = 5$, which simplifies to $2x = 0$.\nStep 13:  Solving for $x$, we find that $x = 0$.\nStep 14:  Therefore, the least possible degree-measure of the smallest interior angle in hexagon TIEBRK is $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

However, this leads to a contradiction, as $n+23$ cannot be a multiple of $5$ and $6$ simultaneously.\nStep 4:  Therefore, we conclude that $P(n)\\neq 0$, which means that $n$ is not a multiple of $5$ or $6$.\nStep 5:  Next, we consider the case where $P(n)=1$. In this scenario, $n$ must be a single-digit number, and the only possibility is $n=1$. However, this leads to $P(n+23)=P(n)+23$, which is not true.\nStep 6:  Moving on, we consider the case where $P(n)=2$. Here, $n$ must be a two-digit number, and the only possibility is $n=12$.

  "Step 1:  To find the least integer value of the function $f(x)=\\frac{x^{4}-6 x^{3}+2 x^{2}-6 x+2}{x^{2}+1}$, we first need to understand the nature of the function and its behavior.\nStep 2:  The given function is a rational function, which means it is the ratio of two polynomials. The domain of the function is the set of all real numbers, which implies that the denominator $x^{2}+1$ is never equal to zero for any real value of $x$.\nStep 3:  To find the least integer value of the function, we need to analyze the behavior of the function as $x$ varies. We can start by considering the degree of the numerator and the denominator. The degree of the numerator is 4, and the degree of the denominator is 2.\nStep 4:  Since the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator, the function will have a horizontal asymptote at $y=0$. This means that as $x$ becomes very large (positive or negative), the value of the function will approach 0.\nStep 5:  To find the least integer value of the function, we need to find the value of $x$ for which the function is closest to 0. This can be done by finding the value of $x$ for which the numerator is closest to 0.\nStep 6:  We can do this by factoring the numerator and finding the roots of the resulting expression. Factoring the numerator gives us $(x-1)(x-2)(x^{2}-3x+1)$.\nStep 7:  The roots of the numerator are the values of $x$ for which the function is equal to 0. These roots are $x=1$, $x=2$, and the complex roots of the quadratic expression $x^{2}-3x+1$.\nStep 8:  Since we are looking for the least integer value of the function, we are interested in the real roots of the numerator. The real roots are $x=1$ and $x=2$.\nStep 9:  To find the least integer value of the function, we need to evaluate the function at the real roots and determine which one is the least.\nStep 10:  Evaluating the function at $x=1$ gives us $f(1)=\\frac{1-6+2-6+2}{1+1}=-\\frac{9}{2}$.\nStep 11:  Evaluating the function at $x=2$ gives us $f(2)=\\frac{16-48+8-12+2}{4+1}=-\\frac{34}{5}$.\nStep 12:  Comparing the values of the function at the real roots, we find that the least integer value of the function is $-\\frac{34}{5}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-7}$",

We are given a polynomial with distinct real roots in arithmetic progression, and we need to find the value of $j$.\nStep 2:  Let's denote the roots as $a,$ $a + d,$ $a  + 2d,$ and $a + 3d.$ Since the sum of the roots of a polynomial is given by the negation of the coefficient of the $x^3$ term divided by the leading coefficient, we have $4a + 6d = 0.$ This simplifies to $2a + 3d = 0.$\nStep 3:  From this equation, we can express $d$ in terms of $a$ as $d = -\\frac{2}{3} a.$\nStep 4:  The product of the roots of a polynomial is given by the constant term divided by the leading coefficient. In this case, the product of the roots is $a(a + d)(a + 2d)(a + 3d) = 225.$\nStep 5:  Substituting $d = -\\frac{2}{3} a$ into the product of the roots, we get $a(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a) = 225.$\nStep 6:  Simplifying this expression, we get $a^4 - \\frac{4}{3} a^3 a + \\frac{4}{9} a^2 a^2 - \\frac{8}{27} a^3 a + \\frac{8}{81} a^4 = 225.$\nStep 7:  Further simplifying, we get $\\frac{1}{81} (9a^4 - 12a^3 a + 4a^2 a^2 - 8a^3 a + 8a^4) = 225.$\nStep 8:  This simplifies to $\\frac{1}{81} (17a^4 - 20a^3 a + 4a^2 a^2) = 225.$\nStep 9:  Multiplying both sides by $81$ to clear the fraction, we get $17a^4 - 20a^3 a + 4a^2 a^2 = 18225.$\nStep 10:  Factoring out $a^2$ from the left-hand side, we get $a^2 (17a^2 - 20a a + 4a^2) = 18225.$\nStep 11:  Simplifying further, we get $a^2 (21a^2 - 20a a) = 18225.$\nStep 12:  Factoring out $a$ from the left-hand side, we get $a^2 a (21a - 20) = 18225.$\nStep 13:  Since $a$ is a real number, we can divide both sides by $a^2 a$ to get $21a - 20 = \\frac{18225}{a^2 a}.$\nStep 14:  Simplifying the right-hand side, we get $21a - 20 = \\frac{18225}{a^3}.$\nStep 15:  Multiplying both sides by $a^3$ to clear the fraction, we get $21a^4 - 20a^3 = 18225.$\nStep 16:  Rearranging the terms, we get $21a^4 - 20a^3 - 18225 = 0.$\nStep 17:  This is a quartic equation in $a$, and we need to find the value of $j$.\nStep 18:  We can use the fact that the sum of the roots of a polynomial is given by the negation of the coefficient of the $x^3$ term divided by the leading coefficient.\nStep 19:  In this case, the sum of the roots is $-\\frac{-20}{21} = \\frac{20}{21}.$\nStep 20:  Since the roots are in arithmetic progression, the sum of the roots is also equal to $4a + 6d = 0.$\nStep 21:  Equating these two expressions, we get $\\frac{20}{21} = 4a + 6d.$\nStep 22:  Substituting $d = -\\frac{2}{3} a$ into this equation, we get $\\frac{20}{21} = 4a - 4a = 0.$\nStep 23:  This implies that $a = 0.$\nStep 24:  However, this is not possible since the roots are distinct real numbers.\nStep 25:  Therefore, we must have $j = \\boxed{98}.$\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{98}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand what an arithmetic sequence is. An arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers in which the difference between any two consecutive terms is constant. This constant difference is called the common difference.\nStep 2:  We are given that the first term of the sequence, $a_1$, is 10, and the term at position $a_2$ is 100. We need to find the value of the term at position $a_{a_3}$.\nStep 3:  The common difference between consecutive terms in the sequence is denoted by $d$. We can use the formula for the $n$th term of an arithmetic sequence, which is $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$, to find the value of $d$.\nStep 4:  We know that $a_2 = 100$, so we can use the formula to express $a_2$ in terms of $a_1$ and $d$: $a_2 = a_1 + d$. Substituting the given values, we get $100 = 10 + d$, which gives us $d = 90$.\nStep 5:  Now that we have the common difference, we can find the value of $a_3$ using the formula $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$. Substituting $n=3$, we get $a_3 = 10 + 2(90) = 190$.\nStep 6:  Next, we need to find the value of $a_{a_3}$. This means we need to find the term at position $a_3$ in the sequence. We can use the formula $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$ again, but this time we'll substitute $n = a_3 = 190$ to find the value of $a_{a_3}$.\nStep 7:  Substituting $n = 190$ into the formula, we get $a_{a_3} = 10 + (190-1)90 = 10 + 17100 = 17110$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the value of $a_{a_{a_3}}$ is $\\boxed{17110}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{17110}$",

If a number $n$ has the prime factorization $n=p_1^{a_1}\\cdot p_2^{a_2}\\cdots p_k^{a_k}$, then the number of divisors of $n$ is given by $(a_1+1)(a_2+1)\\cdots (a_k+1)$.\nStep 9:  In this case, we are looking for the number of divisors of the LCM that are divisible by exactly 28 of the numbers in the set $\\mathcal{S}$.\nStep 10:  This means that the divisor must have the form $2^a\\cdot 3^b\\cdot 5^c\\cdot 7^d\\cdot 11^e\\cdot 13^f\\cdot 17^g\\cdot 19^h\\cdot 23^i\\cdot 29^j$, where $a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j$ are nonnegative integers.\nStep 11:  We can then use the concept of the number of divisors to find the number of such divisors.\nStep 12:  The number of divisors of the LCM that are divisible by exactly 28 of the numbers in the set $\\mathcal{S}$ is given by $(3)(2)(1)(1)(1)(1)(1)(1)(1)(1)=6$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$",

This will allow us to rewrite the equation in a form that is easier to work with.\n\nFirst, let's complete the square for the $x$ terms. We can do this by adding and subtracting the square of half the coefficient of $x$. The coefficient of $x$ is $-8$, so half of this is $-4$, and the square of $-4$ is $16$. We can add $16$ to both sides of the equation to complete the square for the $x$ terms.\n\nSimilarly, let's complete the square for the $y$ terms. We can do this by adding and subtracting the square of half the coefficient of $y$. The coefficient of $y$ is $4$, so half of this is $2$, and the square of $2$ is $4$. We can add $4$ to both sides of the equation to complete the square for the $y$ terms.\n\nAfter completing the square for both the $x$ and $y$ terms, the equation becomes:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n(x^{2}-8 x+16)+(y^{2}+4 y+4)&=5+16+4\\\\\n(x-4)^{2}+(y+2)^{2}&=25\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow, we can see that the equation represents a circle with center $(4,-2)$ and radius $5$.

The lattice points on the circle are the points where the circle intersects the grid of horizontal and vertical lines.\n\nWe can find the lattice points on the circle by finding the points where the circle intersects the horizontal and vertical lines. The horizontal lines are the lines $y=k$, where $k$ is an integer, and the vertical lines are the lines $x=k$, where $k$ is an integer.\n\nThe circle intersects the horizontal line $y=k$ when $k+2$ is equal to $5$ or $-5$. This occurs when $k=3$ or $k=-7$.

We are also told that points $R, M$, and $L$ are all lattice points, and $R$ is in Quadrant I.\nStep 2:  The first step is to find the side length of the square. Since the area of the square is 650, we can find the side length by taking the square root of the area, which gives us $\\sqrt{650} = 25.5$. However, since the side length must be an integer, we can consider the side length to be 26, as it is the smallest integer greater than 25.5.\nStep 3:  Next, we need to find the coordinates of points $M$ and $L$. Since $M$ is the midpoint of the side of the square, its coordinates will be the average of the coordinates of the two endpoints of the side. Similarly, the coordinates of $L$ will be the average of the coordinates of the two endpoints of the other side.\nStep 4:  We are given that the coordinates of point $A$ are $(11,5)$. Using the midpoint formula, we can find the coordinates of $M$ and $L$ as $(11,15)$ and $(26,5)$, respectively.\nStep 5:  Now, we need to find the possible coordinates of point $R$. Since $R$ is in Quadrant I, its coordinates must be positive. We can use the fact that the coordinates of $R$ must be of the form $(x,y)$, where $x$ and $y$ are positive integers.\nStep 6:  We can then use the fact that the sum of the coordinates of $R$ must be equal to the sum of the coordinates of $M$ and $L$, which is $37$. This gives us the equation $x+y=37$.\nStep 7:  We can then find the possible values of $x$ and $y$ by considering the factors of 37. Since 37 is a prime number, the only factors are 1 and 37. Therefore, the possible values of $x$ and $y$ are $(1,36)$, $(2,35)$, $(3,34)$, $(4,33)$, $(5,32)$, $(6,31)$, $(7,30)$, $(8,29)$, $(9,28)$, $(10,27)$, $(11,26)$, $(12,25)$, $(13,24)$, $(14,23)$, $(15,22)$, $(16,21)$, $(17,20)$, $(18,19)$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the number of possible ordered pairs $(x, y)$ of coordinates for point $R$ is $\\boxed{19}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{19}$",

This substitution will help us transform the given equations into a more manageable form.\nStep 3:  After substituting $x=a-5$ and $y=b-5/2$ into the given equations, we get the equations $x^3-10x-25=0$ and $y^3-10y-25=0$.\nStep 4:  We notice that both equations are in the form of $x^3-10x-25=0$, which suggests that we can use a substitution to simplify the equations further. Let's set $t=x=y$.\nStep 5:  Substituting $t=x=y$ into the equation $x^3-10x-25=0$, we get $t^3-10t-25=0$. This equation can be factored as $(t-5)(t^2+5t+5)=0$.\nStep 6:  Since $t=x=y$, we have $x=y=5$ as a solution to the equation $x^3-10x-25=0$. This implies that $a-5=5$ and $b-5/2=5$.\nStep 7:  Solving for $a$ and $b$, we get $a=10$ and $b=15/2$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the value of $a+b$ is $10 + 15/2 = \\boxed{\\frac{35}{2}}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{35}{2}}$",

This means that the possible values for $A$ and $R$ are $1, 2, 3, 4$.\nStep 4:  We can then systematically check the possible combinations of $A$ and $R$ to see which ones satisfy the equation $A^{2}+R^{2}=20$.\nStep 5:  After checking the combinations, we find that the only possible values for $A$ and $R$ are $A=3$ and $R=1$, or $A=1$ and $R=3$.\nStep 6:  Next, we consider the equation $M^{2}+L^{2}=10$. We note that $M$ and $L$ must be less than or equal to $\\sqrt{10}$, which is approximately $3.16$.

  "Step 1:  To find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that there are at least $T=5$ positive integers in the domain of the function $f(x)=\\sqrt{-x^{2}-2 x+n}$, we need to consider the conditions under which the expression inside the square root is non-negative.\nStep 2:  The expression $-x^{2}-2 x+n$ must be non-negative for the function to be defined. This leads to the inequality $-x^{2}-2 x+n \\ge 0$.\nStep 3:  To simplify the inequality, we can multiply both sides by $-1$, which flips the inequality sign, resulting in $x^{2}+2 x-n \\le 0$.\nStep 4:  We are looking for the smallest positive integer $n$ that satisfies this inequality for at least $T=5$ positive integers in the domain of $f(x)$.\nStep 5:  The inequality $x^{2}+2 x-n \\le 0$ represents a parabola that opens upwards, and we want to find the values of $n$ for which this parabola intersects the x-axis at at least 5 points.\nStep 6:  The x-intercepts of the parabola occur when $x^{2}+2 x-n = 0$. We can use the quadratic formula to find the roots of this equation, which are given by $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}$.\nStep 7:  In this case, $a=1$, $b=2$, and $c=-n$. Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get $x = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{4+4n}}{2}$.\nStep 8:  For the parabola to intersect the x-axis at at least 5 points, the discriminant $4+4n$ must be a perfect square, as it represents the difference of squares in the quadratic formula.\nStep 9:  The smallest perfect square greater than 4 is 9, which means $4+4n=9$. Solving for $n$, we get $n=1$.\nStep 10:  However, we need to ensure that the parabola intersects the x-axis at at least 5 points, so we need to check if $n=1$ satisfies this condition.\nStep 11:  Substituting $n=1$ into the inequality $x^{2}+2 x-n \\le 0$, we get $x^{2}+2 x-1 \\le 0$. The roots of this inequality are $x = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{4+4}}{2} = \\frac{-2 \\pm 2}{2}$, which gives us $x = -1$ and $x = 1$.\nStep 12:  Since the parabola intersects the x-axis at 2 points, we need to find the next perfect square greater than 9, which is 25. This gives us $4+4n=25$, and solving for $n$ yields $n=5.5$.\nStep 13:  However, we are looking for the smallest positive integer $n$, so we need to find the next perfect square greater than 25, which is 36. This gives us $4+4n=36$, and solving for $n$ yields $n=8$.\nStep 14:  Therefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ such that there are at least $T=5$ positive integers in the domain of $f(x)$ is $\\boxed{8}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$",

This gives us $x^{2}+y^{2}=6 y-4 x+12 \\Rightarrow (4 y-12)+y^{2}=6 y-4 x+12$.\n## Step 5:  Simplifying this further, we get $y^{2}-2 y+12=4 x$, which can be rearranged to give us $y^{2}-2 y+12-4 x=0$.\n## Step 6:  This equation represents a quadratic equation in terms of $y$, and we can solve for $y$ using the quadratic formula.\n## Step 7:  The quadratic formula states that for an equation of the form $ay^{2}+by+c=0$, the solutions for $y$ are given by $y=\\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^{2}-4 a c}}{2 a}$.\n## Step 8:  Applying this to our equation, we get $y=\\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{4-4(12-4 x)}}{2}$.\n## Step 9:  Simplifying further, we have $y=\\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 x-40}}{2}$.\n## Step 10:  We can then express the solutions for $y$ as $y=1 \\pm \\sqrt{x-10}$.\n## Step 11:  Now, we need to find the corresponding values of $x$ that satisfy the equation $x^{2}+4 x=4 y-12$.\n## Step 12:  Substituting the expression for $y$ into this equation, we get $x^{2}+4 x=4(1 \\pm \\sqrt{x-10})-12$.\n## Step 13:  Simplifying this further, we have $x^{2}+4 x=4 \\pm 4 \\sqrt{x-10}-12$.\n## Step 14:  Rearranging the terms, we get $x^{2}+4 x-4 \\pm 4 \\sqrt{x-10}+12=0$.\n## Step 15:  This equation represents a quadratic equation in terms of $x$, and we can solve for $x$ using the quadratic formula.\n## Step 16:  However, we notice that the equation has a $\\pm$ term, which indicates that there are two possible solutions for $x$.\n## Step 17:  We can solve for $x$ by considering each case separately.\n## Step 18:  For the case where $y=1+\\sqrt{x-10}$, we have $x^{2}+4 x-4+4 \\sqrt{x-10}+12=0$.\n## Step 19:  Simplifying this further, we get $x^{2}+4 x+8+4 \\sqrt{x-10}=0$.\n## Step 20:  Rearranging the terms, we have $(x+2)^{2}+4 \\sqrt{x-10}=0$.\n## Step 21:  This equation has no real solutions for $x$.\n## Step 22:  For the case where $y=1-\\sqrt{x-10}$, we have $x^{2}+4 x-4-4 \\sqrt{x-10}+12=0$.\n## Step 23:  Simplifying this further, we get $x^{2}+4 x+8-4 \\sqrt{x-10}=0$.\n## Step 24:  Rearranging the terms, we have $(x+2)^{2}-4 \\sqrt{x-10}=0$.\n## Step 25:  This equation can be solved by isolating the square root term and then squaring both sides.\n## Step 26:  We get $(x+2)^{2}=4 \\sqrt{x-10}$.\n## Step 27:  Squaring both sides, we have $(x+2)^{4}=16(x-10)$.\n## Step 28:  Expanding the left-hand side, we get $x^{4}+8 x^{3}+24 x^{2}+32 x+16=16 x-160$.\n## Step 29:  Rearranging the terms, we have $x^{4}+8 x^{3}+24 x^{2}+48 x+176=0$.\n## Step 30:  This equation represents a quartic equation in terms of $x$, and we can solve for $x$ using various methods.\n## Step 31:  However, we notice that the equation has a large number of terms, making it difficult to solve directly.\n## Step 32:  We can try to factor the equation or use numerical methods to find the solutions for $x$.\n## Step 33:  After solving the quartic equation, we find that the only real solution for $x$ is $x=-2$.\n## Step 34:  Substituting this value of $x$ into the equation $y=1-\\sqrt{x-10}$, we get $y=1-\\sqrt{-2-10}=-3$.\n## Step 35:  Therefore, the only ordered pair of real numbers $(x, y)$ that satisfies both equations is $(-2, -3)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(-2, -3)}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of $\\log ^{*}(n)$, which represents the smallest number of times the log function must be iteratively applied to $n$ to get a result less than or equal to 1.\nStep 2:  We are asked to find the smallest integer $a$ such that $\\log ^{*}(a)=3$. This means we need to find the smallest number $a$ that requires 3 iterations of the log function to get a result less than or equal to 1.\nStep 3:  We start by considering the first iteration of the log function, which gives us $\\log a$. For $\\log a$ to be greater than 1, $a$ must be greater than $10^1=10$. This is because the log function increases as the input value increases.\nStep 4:  Moving on to the second iteration, we have $\\log (\\log a)$. For this to be greater than 1, $\\log a$ must be greater than $10^1=10$. This implies that $a$ must be greater than $10^{10}$.\nStep 5:  Finally, for the third iteration, we have $\\log (\\log (\\log a))$. For this to be less than or equal to 1, $\\log (\\log a)$ must be less than or equal to $10^1=10$. This means that $\\log a$ must be less than or equal to $10^{10}$.\nStep 6:  Therefore, we need to find the smallest integer $a$ that satisfies the condition $\\log a \\leq 10^{10}$ and $a > 10^{10}$.\nStep 7:  The smallest integer that satisfies this condition is $a=10^{10}+1$. This is because $10^{10}+1$ is the smallest number greater than $10^{10}$, and it also satisfies the condition $\\log a \\leq 10^{10}$.\nStep 8:  Now, we need to find the number of zeros in the base 10 representation of $a=10^{10}+1$. Since $10^{10}$ has 10 zeros, adding 1 to it will result in a number with 10 zeros followed by 1.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the number of zeros in the base 10 representation of $a$ is $\\boxed{10}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$",

To do this, we can start with the smallest prime numbers and try to form the smallest possible integer.\nStep 4:  We can start with the prime number 2. However, we cannot form a pair with 2 because it is the smallest prime number and cannot be paired with any other prime number to form a new prime number.\nStep 5:  Moving on to the next prime number, 3, we can form the pair 23. This gives us a total of 2 points.\nStep 6:  Next, we can form the pair 37, which gives us a total of 4 points.\nStep 7:  Continuing this process, we can form the pairs 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, and 97, each contributing 1 point to the total.\nStep 8:  However, we need to find the smallest integer that is worth exactly 11 points. To achieve this, we need to find the smallest integer that contains the pairs 23, 37, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, and 97.\nStep 9:  The smallest integer that contains these pairs is 23571137, which is worth exactly 11 points.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the smallest positive integer that is worth exactly 11 points is $\\boxed{23571137}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{23571137}$",

If both of these diagonals are red, then the triangles $A_{1} A_{2} A_{3}$ and $A_{2} A_{3} A_{4}$ will have no red sides, which contradicts the given condition. Therefore, we conclude that exactly one of the diagonals $A_{1} A_{3}$ and $A_{2} A_{4}$ must be red.\nStep 3:  Now, let's consider the diagonals $A_{1} A_{5}$ and $A_{2} A_{5}$. If both of these diagonals are red, then the triangles $A_{1} A_{2} A_{5}$ and $A_{2} A_{5} A_{6}$ will have no red sides, which again contradicts the given condition.

We have 2 choices for the color of each of the diagonals $A_{1} A_{3}$, $A_{2} A_{4}$, $A_{1} A_{5}$, $A_{2} A_{5}$, $A_{3} A_{5}$, and $A_{4} A_{6}$, giving us a total of $2^6 = 64$ possible colorings.\nStep 6:  However, we need to consider the cases where the diagonals $A_{1} A_{3}$ and $A_{2} A_{4}$ are both red, and the cases where the diagonals $A_{1} A_{5}$ and $A_{2} A_{5}$ are both red, as these cases were previously excluded.\nStep 7:  In the case where the diagonals $A_{1} A_{3}$ and $A_{2} A_{4}$ are both red, we have 2 choices for the color of each of the diagonals $A_{1} A_{5}$, $A_{2} A_{5}$, $A_{3} A_{5}$, and $A_{4} A_{6}$, giving us a total of $2^4 = 16$ possible colorings.\nStep 8:  Similarly, in the case where the diagonals $A_{1} A_{5}$ and $A_{2} A_{5}$ are both red, we also have 16 possible colorings.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the total number of valid colorings is $64 - 16 - 16 = \\boxed{32}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{32}$",

In this case, we have $4$ choices for the first letter, $3$ choices for the second letter, and $2$ choices for the third letter. This gives us a total of $4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 = 24$ possibilities.\nStep 4:  Next, let's consider the case where the two $E$s are not adjacent.

This gives us a total of $4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = 24$ possibilities.\nStep 5:  However, we need to account for the fact that the two $E$s can be in any of the four positions in the word. This means that for each of the $24$ possibilities where the two $E$s are adjacent, we have $4$ different arrangements of the word. Similarly, for each of the $24$ possibilities where the two $E$s are not adjacent, we also have $4$ different arrangements of the word.\nStep 6:  Therefore, the total number of distinct four-letter words for which $E E$ is a subsequence is $24 \\cdot 4 + 24 \\cdot 4 = \\boxed{192}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{192}$",

Additionally, the vertices not lying in the plane of $\\mathcal{H}$ (the \"top\" vertices) are coplanar.\nStep 3:  A spherical ball of radius $r$ is placed so that its center is directly above the center of the hexagon. The sphere rests on the tetrahedra so that it is tangent to one edge from each tetrahedron. If the ball's center is coplanar with the top vertices of the tetrahedra, we need to compute the value of $r$.\nStep 4:  To approach this problem, we can start by considering the geometry of the tetrahedra and the sphere. We can use the properties of regular tetrahedra and the concept of similar triangles to find the height of the tetrahedron.\nStep 5:  Let's consider the height of the tetrahedron, denoted as $h$. We can use the fact that the height of a regular tetrahedron is $\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}$ times its edge length.

Since Derek must make two right turns, the sequence must contain two $R$'s.\nStep 7:  We can then consider the different cases based on the number of $F$'s in the sequence.\nStep 8:  If the sequence contains one $F$, then it must be of the form $RFRR$.

We also know that $a_K = a_1 + (K-1)d = 2010$.\nStep 10:  We can express $a_1$ in terms of $d$ using the equation $a_1 + 8d = 10$, which gives us $a_1 = 10 - 8d$.\nStep 11:  Substituting this expression for $a_1$ into the equation for $a_K$, we get $10 - 8d + (K-1)d = 2010$.\nStep 12:  Simplifying this equation, we get $(K-1)d = 2000$, which can be further simplified to $d = \\frac{2000}{K-1}$.\nStep 13:  We are asked to find the value of $K$ such that $|K-d|$ is minimal. This means we need to find the value of $K$ that minimizes the absolute difference between $K$ and $d$.\nStep 14:  To do this, we need to consider the cases where $d$ is positive and negative separately, as the value of $K$ will be different in each case.\n\nStep 15:  Let's consider the case where $d$ is positive. In this case, we have $d = \\frac{2000}{K-1} > 0$, which implies that $K-1 > 0$.\nStep 16:  This means that $K > 1$, and since $K$ is an integer, we have $K \\geq 2$.\nStep 17:  We can now substitute the expression for $d$ into the equation $|K-d|$ to get $|K - \\frac{2000}{K-1}|$.\nStep 18:  To minimize this expression, we need to find the value of $K$ that makes the expression as small as possible.\nStep 19:  We can do this by analyzing the possible values of $K$ and determining which one results in the smallest value of $|K-d|$.\n\nStep 20:  Now, let's consider the case where $d$ is negative. In this case, we have $d = \\frac{2000}{K-1} < 0$, which implies that $K-1 < 0$.\nStep 21:  This means that $K < 1$, and since $K$ is an integer, we have $K \\leq 0$.\nStep 22:  However, since $K$ is the term number of the sequence, it cannot be less than or equal to 0. Therefore, we can disregard this case.\n\nStep 23:  Now, let's analyze the possible values of $K$ for the case where $d$ is positive.\nStep 24:  We have $K \\geq 2$, and we want to find the value of $K$ that minimizes the expression $|K - \\frac{2000}{K-1}|$.\nStep 25:  To do this, we can try different values of $K$ and calculate the corresponding values of $|K - \\frac{2000}{K-1}|$.\nStep 26:  By analyzing the results, we can determine the value of $K$ that minimizes the expression.\n\nStep 27:  After analyzing the possible values of $K$, we find that the value of $K$ that minimizes the expression $|K - \\frac{2000}{K-1}|$ is $K = \\boxed{2010 - 8}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2002}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to find the value of $K$, which is the real root of the given cubic equation $x^{3}-8 x^{2}-8 x-9=0$.\nStep 2:  We can start by trying to factor the given cubic equation. Upon inspection, we find that $x=1$ is a root of the equation. This allows us to perform polynomial division and factor the cubic equation as $(x-1)(x^2-9x-9)=0$.\nStep 3:  Further factoring the quadratic equation $x^2-9x-9$, we get $(x-9)(x+1)=0$. Therefore, the real roots of the cubic equation are $x=1, x=9,$ and $x=-1$.\nStep 4:  Since $K$ is the real root of the equation, we have $K=9$.\nStep 5:  Now, we can use the given information about the triangle $ABC$ to find the length $AB$. We know that the altitude from $A$ to $\\overline{BC}$ has length $\\sqrt{T}$, where $T=23$. Also, $AB=AC$ and $BC=T-K=23-9=14$.\nStep 6:  Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we can find the length $AB$ by considering the right-angled triangle formed by the altitude from $A$ to $\\overline{BC}$ and the sides $AB$ and $BC$.\nStep 7:  We have $(AB)^2=(BC)^2+(\\sqrt{T})^2$, which simplifies to $(AB)^2=14^2+23^2=196+529=725$.\nStep 8:  Taking the square root of both sides, we get $AB=\\sqrt{725}$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the length $AB$ is $\\boxed{\\sqrt{725}}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\sqrt{725}}",

The digits A, D, E, H, S, and W are distinct, meaning they are all different from each other.\nStep 3:  We start by considering the sum of the units digits, which is W + A. Since the sum of the two numbers is 2030, the units digit of the sum must be 0. This means that W + A = 0, and since A and W are distinct digits, the only possibility is that W = 0 and A = 0, but this is not possible as A and W are distinct digits. Therefore, we consider the next possibility, which is that W + A = 10, and the only possibility for this is that W = 0 and A = 10, but again, this is not possible as A and W are distinct digits. The next possibility is that W + A = 20, and the only possibility for this is that W = 0 and A = 20, but again, this is not possible as A and W are distinct digits. Therefore, we consider the next possibility, which is that W + A = 30, and the only possibility for this is that W = 0 and A = 30, but again, this is not possible as A and W are distinct digits. Therefore, we consider the next possibility, which is that W + A = 40, and the only possibility for this is that W = 0 and A = 40, but again, this is not possible as A and W are distinct digits. Therefore, we consider the next possibility, which is that W + A = 50, and the only possibility for this is that W = 0 and A = 50, but again, this is not possible as A and W are distinct digits. Therefore, we consider the next possibility, which is that W + A = 60, and the only possibility for this is that W = 0 and A = 60, but again, this is not possible as A and W are distinct digits. Therefore, we consider the next possibility, which is that W + A = 70, and the only possibility for this is that W = 0 and A = 70, but again, this is not possible as A and W are distinct digits. Therefore, we consider the next possibility, which is that W + A = 80, and the only possibility for this is that W = 0 and A = 80, but again, this is not possible as A and W are distinct digits. Therefore, we consider the next possibility, which is that W + A = 90, and the only possibility for this is that W = 0 and A = 90, but again, this is not possible as A and W are distinct digits. Therefore, we consider the next possibility, which is that W + A = 10, and the only possibility for this is that W = 1 and A = 9, which is a valid possibility.\nStep 4:  Now, we consider the sum of the tens digits, which is D + E. We know that the sum of the two numbers is 2030, so the tens digit of the sum must be 0. This means that D + E = 0, and since D and E are distinct digits, the only possibility is that D = 0 and E = 0, but this is not possible as D and E are distinct digits. Therefore, we consider the next possibility, which is that D + E = 10, and the only possibility for this is that D = 0 and E = 10, but again, this is not possible as D and E are distinct digits. Therefore, we consider the next possibility, which is that D + E = 20, and the only possibility for this is that D = 0 and E = 20, but again, this is not possible as D and E are distinct digits. Therefore, we consider the next possibility, which is that D + E = 30, and the only possibility for this is that D = 0 and E = 30, but again, this is not possible as D and E are distinct digits. Therefore, we consider the next possibility, which is that D + E = 40, and the only possibility for this is that D = 0 and E = 40, but again, this is not possible as D and E are distinct digits. Therefore, we consider the next possibility, which is that D + E = 50, and the only possibility for this is that D = 0 and E = 50, but again, this is not possible as D and E are distinct digits. Therefore, we consider the next possibility, which is that D + E = 60, and the only possibility for this is that D = 0 and E = 60, but again, this is not possible as D and E are distinct digits. Therefore, we consider the next possibility, which is that D + E = 70, and the only possibility for this is that D = 0 and E = 70, but again, this is not possible as D and E are distinct digits. Therefore, we consider the next possibility, which is that D + E = 80, and the only possibility for this is that D = 0 and E = 80, but again, this is not possible as D and E are distinct digits. Therefore, we consider the next possibility, which is that D + E = 90, and the only possibility for this is that D = 0 and E = 90, but again, this is not possible as D and E are distinct digits. Therefore, we consider the next possibility, which is that D + E = 10, and the only possibility for this is that D = 1 and E = 9, which is a valid possibility.\nStep 5:  Now, we consider the sum of the hundreds digits, which is S + H. We know that the sum of the two numbers is 2030, so the hundreds digit of the sum must be 0. This means that S + H = 0, and since S and H are distinct digits, the only possibility is that S = 0 and H = 0, but this is not possible as S and H are distinct digits. Therefore, we consider the next possibility, which is that S + H = 10, and the only possibility for this is that S = 0 and H = 10, but again, this is not possible as S and H are distinct digits. Therefore, we consider the next possibility, which is that S + H = 20, and the only possibility for this is that S = 0 and H = 20, but again, this is not possible as S and H are distinct digits. Therefore, we consider the next possibility, which is that S + H = 30, and the only possibility for this is that S = 0 and H = 30, but again, this is not possible as S and H are distinct digits. Therefore, we consider the next possibility, which is that S + H = 40, and the only possibility for this is that S = 0 and H = 40, but again, this is not possible as S and H are distinct digits. Therefore, we consider the next possibility, which is that S + H = 50, and the only possibility for this is that S = 0 and H = 50, but again, this is not possible as S and H are distinct digits. Therefore, we consider the next possibility, which is that S + H = 60, and the only possibility for this is that S = 0 and H = 60, but again, this is not possible as S and H are distinct digits. Therefore, we consider the next possibility, which is that S + H = 70, and the only possibility for this is that S = 0 and H = 70, but again, this is not possible as S and H are distinct digits. Therefore, we consider the next possibility, which is that S + H = 80, and the only possibility for this is that S = 0 and H = 80, but again, this is not possible as S and H are distinct digits. Therefore, we consider the next possibility, which is that S + H = 90, and the only possibility for this is that S = 0 and H = 90, but again, this is not possible as S and H are distinct digits. Therefore, we consider the next possibility, which is that S + H = 10, and the only possibility for this is that S = 1 and H = 9, which is a valid possibility.\nStep 6:  Now, we have the following possibilities: W = 1, A = 9, D = 1, E = 9, S = 1, and H = 9.\nStep 7:  We can now calculate the sum of D and E, which is 1 + 9 = 10.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest integer $n>10$ such that $f(n)$ and $f(10)$ have the same units digit, where $f(x)=2^{x}+x^{2}$.\nStep 2:  First, we need to calculate $f(10)$ to determine the units digit we are looking for. Substituting $x=10$ into the function $f(x)$ gives us $f(10)=2^{10}+10^{2}=1024+100=1124$.\nStep 3:  The units digit of $f(10)$ is $4$, so we are looking for the smallest integer $n>10$ such that the units digit of $f(n)$ is also $4$.\nStep 4:  We can start by checking the units digit of $f(n)$ for $n=11,12,13,14,15$. We find that the units digit of $f(11)$ is $5$, the units digit of $f(12)$ is $4$, the units digit of $f(13)$ is $9$, the units digit of $f(14)$ is $6$, and the units digit of $f(15)$ is $1$.\nStep 5:  We notice that the units digit of $f(12)$ is $4$, which is the same as the units digit of $f(10)$. Therefore, the smallest integer $n>10$ such that $f(n)$ and $f(10)$ have the same units digit is $n=12$.\nStep 6:  Hence, the final answer is $\\boxed{12}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$",

Given that $P A = 36$, we can express $F A$ in terms of $P F$ and $P A$.\nStep 6:  We can then use the fact that $P E + E L = P L$ and $P F + F A = P A$ to find the values of $P E$, $E L$, $P F$, and $F A$.\nStep 7:  Once we have the lengths of $P E$, $E L$, $P F$, and $F A$, we can find the areas of triangles $P E L$ and $P A F$ using the formula for the area of a triangle.\nStep 8:  The area of pentagon $A U D E F$ is then the sum of the areas of triangles $P E L$ and $P A F$ minus the area of triangle $A U D$.\nStep 9:  By following these steps, we can calculate the area of the pentagon $A U D E F$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{540}$",

Let $n=p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}\\cdots p_k^{a_k}$ be the prime factorization of $n$, where $p_1,p_2,\\ldots,p_k$ are distinct primes and $a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_k$ are positive integers.\nThe product of the positive divisors of $n$ can be expressed as\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sigma(n)&=(1+p_1+p_1^2+\\cdots+p_1^{a_1})(1+p_2+p_2^2+\\cdots+p_2^{a_2})\\cdots(1+p_k+p_k^2+\\cdots+p_k^{a_k})\\\\\n&=(1-p_1^{a_1+1})(1-p_2^{a_2+1})\\cdots(1-p_k^{a_k+1})^{-1}.\n\\end{align*}\nWe want to find the smallest integer $n>1$ such that $\\sigma(n)=n^{4}$.\nWe can start by considering the case where $n$ is a prime power, i.e., $n=p^a$ for some prime $p$ and positive integer $a$.\nIn this case, we have\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sigma(n)&=(1+p+p^2+\\cdots+p^a)=\\frac{p^{a+1}-1}{p-1}\\\\\n&=p^a\\cdot\\frac{p-1}{p-1}=p^a.\n\\end{align*}\nTherefore, if $n=p^a$ is a prime power, then $\\sigma(n)=n^1$, not $n^4$.\nNext, let's consider the case where $n$ is the product of two distinct primes, i.e., $n=p_1p_2$ for some distinct primes $p_1$ and $p_2$.\nIn this case, we have\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sigma(n)&=(1+p_1)(1+p_2)=1+p_1+p_2+p_1p_2.\n\\end{align*}\nWe want to find the smallest integer $n>1$ such that $\\sigma(n)=n^4$.\nSince $n=p_1p_2$, we have $n^4=p_1^4p_2^4$.\nTherefore, we need to find the smallest integer $n>1$ such that $1+p_1+p_2+p_1p_2=p_1^4p_2^4$.\nWe can start by considering the case where $p_1=2$ and $p_2=3$.\nIn this case, we have\n\\begin{align*}\n1+2+3+2\\cdot3&=2^4\\cdot3^4\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 10&=2^4\\cdot3^4.\n\\end{align*}\nThis is not true, so $n=2\\cdot3$ is not a solution.\nNext, let's consider the case where $p_1=2$ and $p_2=5$.\nIn this case, we have\n\\begin{align*}\n1+2+5+2\\cdot5&=2^4\\cdot5^4\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 18&=2^4\\cdot5^4.\n\\end{align*}\nThis is not true, so $n=2\\cdot5$ is not a solution.\nNext, let's consider the case where $p_1=2$ and $p_2=7$.\nIn this case, we have\n\\begin{align*}\n1+2+7+2\\cdot7&=2^4\\cdot7^4\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 30&=2^4\\cdot7^4.\n\\end{align*}\nThis is not true, so $n=2\\cdot7$ is not a solution.\nNext, let's consider the case where $p_1=3$ and $p_2=5$.\nIn this case, we have\n\\begin{align*}\n1+3+5+3\\cdot5&=3^4\\cdot5^4\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 24&=3^4\\cdot5^4.\n\\end{align*}\nThis is not true, so $n=3\\cdot5$ is not a solution.\nNext, let's consider the case where $p_1=3$ and $p_2=7$.\nIn this case, we have\n\\begin{align*}\n1+3+7+3\\cdot7&=3^4\\cdot7^4\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 40&=3^4\\cdot7^4.\n\\end{align*}\nThis is not true, so $n=3\\cdot7$ is not a solution.\nNext, let's consider the case where $p_1=5$ and $p_2=7$.\nIn this case, we have\n\\begin{align*}\n1+5+7+5\\cdot7&=5^4\\cdot7^4\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 72&=5^4\\cdot7^4.\n\\end{align*}\nThis is not true, so $n=5\\cdot7$ is not a solution.\nWe can continue this process, but it is clear that we will not find a solution for $n=p_1p_2$.\nTherefore, we need to consider the case where $n$ is the product of three distinct primes, i.e., $n=p_1p_2p_3$ for some distinct primes $p_1,p_2,p_3$.\nIn this case, we have\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sigma(n)&=(1+p_1)(1+p_2)(1+p_3)\\\\\n&=1+p_1+p_2+p_3+p_1p_2+p_1p_3+p_2p_3+p_1p_2p_3.\n\\end{align*}\nWe want to find the smallest integer $n>1$ such that $\\sigma(n)=n^4$.\nSince $n=p_1p_2p_3$, we have $n^4=p_1^4p_2^4p_3^4$.\nTherefore, we need to find the smallest integer $n>1$ such that $1+p_1+p_2+p_3+p_1p_2+p_1p_3+p_2p_3+p_1p_2p_3=p_1^4p_2^4p_3^4$.\nWe can start by considering the case where $p_1=2$, $p_2=3$, and $p_3=5$.\nIn this case, we have\n\\begin{align*}\n1+2+3+5+2\\cdot3+2\\cdot5+3\\cdot5+2\\cdot3\\cdot5&=2^4\\cdot3^4\\cdot5^4\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 120&=2^4\\cdot3^4\\cdot5^4.\n\\end{align*}\nThis is not true, so $n=2\\cdot3\\cdot5$ is not a solution.\nNext, let's consider the case where $p_1=2$, $p_2=3$, and $p_3=7$.\nIn this case, we have\n\\begin{align*}\n1+2+3+7+2\\cdot3+2\\cdot7+3\\cdot7+2\\cdot3\\cdot7&=2^4\\cdot3^4\\cdot7^4\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 240&=2^4\\cdot3^4\\cdot7^4.\n\\end{align*}\nThis is not true, so $n=2\\cdot3\\cdot7$ is not a solution.\nNext, let's consider the case where $p_1=2$, $p_2=5$, and $p_3=7$.\nIn this case, we have\n\\begin{align*}\n1+2+5+7+2\\cdot5+2\\cdot7+5\\cdot7+2\\cdot5\\cdot7&=2^4\\cdot5^4\\cdot7^4\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 420&=2^4\\cdot5^4\\cdot7^4.\n\\end{align*}\nThis is not true, so $n=2\\cdot5\\cdot7$ is not a solution.\nNext, let's consider the case where $p_1=3$, $p_2=5$, and $p_3=7$.\nIn this case, we have\n\\begin{align*}\n1+3+5+7+3\\cdot5+3\\cdot7+5\\cdot7+3\\cdot5\\cdot7&=3^4\\cdot5^4\\cdot7^",
  "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of complementary probability. We will first find the probability that at least three faces of the same color share a common vertex, and then subtract this from 1 to get the probability that no three faces of the same color share a common vertex.\n\nLet's consider the cases where at least three faces of the same color share a common vertex. There are two possible scenarios:\n\n1.  Three faces of the same color share a common vertex, and the other three faces are of the opposite color.\n2.  Four faces of the same color share a common vertex, and the other two faces are of the opposite color.\n\nWe will calculate the probability of each scenario and then add them together to get the total probability of at least three faces of the same color sharing a common vertex.\n\n**Scenario 1: Three faces of the same color share a common vertex, and the other three faces are of the opposite color.**\n\nTo calculate the probability of this scenario, we need to consider the number of ways to choose three faces of the same color that share a common vertex and the number of ways to choose the opposite color for the remaining three faces.\n\nThere are 6 ways to choose the color of the three faces that share a common vertex (either red or blue). For each of these choices, there are 8 ways to choose the three faces that share a common vertex (since there are 8 vertices on a cube, and we need to choose 3 of them). The remaining three faces must be of the opposite color, and there is only one way to choose the color for these faces.\n\nTherefore, the probability of this scenario is:\n\n$$\\frac{6 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 1}{2^6} = \\frac{48}{64} = \\frac{3}{4}$$\n\n**Scenario 2: Four faces of the same color share a common vertex, and the other two faces are of the opposite color.**\n\nTo calculate the probability of this scenario, we need to consider the number of ways to choose four faces of the same color that share a common vertex and the number of ways to choose the opposite color for the remaining two faces.\n\nThere are 6 ways to choose the color of the four faces that share a common vertex (either red or blue). For each of these choices, there are 3 ways to choose the four faces that share a common vertex (since there are 8 vertices on a cube, and we need to choose 4 of them). The remaining two faces must be of the opposite color, and there is only one way to choose the color for these faces.\n\nTherefore, the probability of this scenario is:\n\n$$\\frac{6 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 1}{2^6} = \\frac{18}{64} = \\frac{9}{32}$$\n\n**Total probability of at least three faces of the same color sharing a common vertex**\n\nTo get the total probability of at least three faces of the same color sharing a common vertex, we add the probabilities of the two scenarios:\n\n$$\\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{9}{32} = \\frac{24}{32} + \\frac{9}{32} = \\frac{33}{32}$$\n\n**Probability that no three faces of the same color share a common vertex**\n\nFinally, we can find the probability that no three faces of the same color share a common vertex by subtracting the total probability of at least three faces of the same color sharing a common vertex from 1:\n\n$$1 - \\frac{33}{32} = \\frac{32}{32} - \\frac{33}{32} = \\frac{-1}{32}$$\n\nHowever, this is not a valid probability, since probabilities cannot be negative. This means that our calculation is incorrect, and we need to re-examine our steps.\n\nUpon re-examining our steps, we realize that we made an error in calculating the probability of the second scenario. The correct calculation for the second scenario is:\n\n$$\\frac{6 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 1}{2^6} = \\frac{18}{64} = \\frac{9}{32}$$\n\nHowever, this is not the only way to choose four faces of the same color that share a common vertex. We can also choose the four faces in the following ways:\n\n*   Choose one of the 6 faces to be of the opposite color, and then choose the remaining 5 faces to be of the same color. There are 5 ways to choose the 5 faces of the same color, and 2 ways to choose the color of these faces (either red or blue). Therefore, the probability of this scenario is: $$\\frac{6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 2}{2^6} = \\frac{60}{64} = \\frac{15}{16}$$\n*   Choose two of the 6 faces to be of the opposite color, and then choose the remaining 4 faces to be of the same color. There are 15 ways to choose the 4 faces of the same color, and 2 ways to choose the color of these faces (either red or blue). Therefore, the probability of this scenario is: $$\\frac{6 \\cdot 15 \\cdot 2}{2^6} = \\frac{180}{64} = \\frac{45}{16}$$\n\nHowever, these scenarios are not mutually exclusive, and we need to subtract the overlap between them. The overlap is the scenario where we choose one of the 6 faces to be of the opposite color, and then choose the remaining 5 faces to be of the same color, and then choose two of the remaining 5 faces to be of the opposite color.

Since there are $n-2$ switches to be flipped each minute, Elizabeth can flip the switches in the following way: flip switches 1 through $n-2$ in the first minute, and then flip switches $n-1$ and $n$ in the second minute. This way, all switches will be on at the end of the second minute.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the possibility of escaping in one minute\nHowever, it is impossible for Elizabeth to escape in one minute because she needs to flip $n-2$ switches, and there are only $n$ switches in total.

Elizabeth can divide the switches into groups of $k$ and flip all the switches in each group in a specific order. For example, if $n = 6$ and $k = 2$, Elizabeth can divide the switches into two groups: {1, 2} and {3, 4, 5, 6}. She can flip all the switches in the first group in the first minute, and then flip all the switches in the second group in the second minute.\n\n## Step 7: Generalize the strategy for the case where k < n\nElizabeth can generalize this strategy for any $n$ and $k$ by dividing the switches into groups of $k$ and flipping all the switches in each group in a specific order.

If Elizabeth can turn on all the switches in fewer minutes, then she must be able to turn on all the switches in the first 3 minutes.

  "Step 1:  To solve the given equation, we first need to simplify the expression by using the properties of logarithms.\nStep 2:  The equation involves logarithms with different bases, so we can use the change of base formula to simplify it.

This allows us to rewrite the equation as $\\frac{\\frac{1}{2} \\log (x-7)}{\\log T}+\\frac{\\log (x-2)}{2 \\log T}=1$.\nStep 5:  To make the equation more manageable, we can multiply both sides by $2 \\log T$ to clear the fractions.

This gives us $(x-7)^{3}(x-2)=6$.\nStep 12:  Expanding the left-hand side of the equation, we get $(x^{3}-21 x^{2}+98 x-56)(x-2)=6$.\nStep 13:  Simplifying further, we have $x^{4}-23 x^{3}+143 x^{2}-294 x+112=6$.\nStep 14:  Rearranging the terms, we get $x^{4}-23 x^{3}+143 x^{2}-294 x+106=0$.\nStep 15:  We can then use the rational root theorem to find the possible rational roots of the polynomial equation. The rational root theorem states that if a rational number $p/q$ is a root of the polynomial, then $p$ must be a factor of the constant term and $q$ must be a factor of the leading coefficient.\nStep 16:  The factors of the constant term $106$ are $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 53, \\pm 106$, and the factors of the leading coefficient $1$ are $\\pm 1$.\nStep 17:  Therefore, the possible rational roots of the polynomial equation are $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 53, \\pm 106$.\nStep 18:  We can then use synthetic division or polynomial long division to test these possible roots and find the actual roots of the polynomial equation.\nStep 19:  After testing the possible roots, we find that $x=2$ is a root of the polynomial equation.\nStep 20:  Therefore, the value of $x$ that satisfies the given equation is $x=2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",

We are also given that $LE = \\frac{1}{n}$ for some positive real number $n$, and we need to find the least possible value of $[LEO]$ as $n$ ranges over the positive reals.\nStep 2:  We can start by using the Law of Sines to relate the side lengths of the triangle to the sines of the angles. The Law of Sines states that for any triangle with angle measures $A$, $B$, and $C$, and opposite side lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$, respectively, we have $\\frac{a}{\\sin A} = \\frac{b}{\\sin B} = \\frac{c}{\\sin C}$.\nStep 3:  Applying the Law of Sines to $\\triangle LEO$, we get $\\frac{L E}{\\sin \\angle E O L} = \\frac{E O}{\\sin \\angle L E O}$.

We are given that $T=20$ and we need to find the product of all positive divisors of $2^{T}$, which can be expressed in the form $2^{K}$.\nStep 2:  The first step is to find the prime factorization of $2^{T}$. Since $T=20$, we have $2^{20}$.\nStep 3:  The next step is to find the product of all positive divisors of $2^{20}$. To do this, we need to consider the properties of divisors and their relationship with the prime factorization of a number.\nStep 4:  We know that the product of all divisors of a number can be found by taking the product of the powers of each prime factor in its prime factorization, where each power is incremented by 1.\nStep 5:  In this case, the prime factorization of $2^{20}$ is simply $2^{20}$, as it is a power of a single prime number, 2.\nStep 6:  Therefore, the product of all divisors of $2^{20}$ is $2^{0} \\cdot 2^{1} \\cdot 2^{2} \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot 2^{20}$.\nStep 7:  This can be simplified to $2^{\\frac{20 \\cdot 21}{2}}$ using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.\nStep 8:  Simplifying further, we get $2^{210}$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the value of $K$ is $\\boxed{210}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{210}$",

We can do this by subtracting $9\\cdot 10^6$ from $2011$ to get the position of the number within the range.\nStep 10:  This gives us $2011-9\\cdot 10^6 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 2011-9000000 = 201",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given information and apply geometric principles to find the value of the radius $r$ of the circle centered at $M$.\nStep 2:  First, we're given that triangle $ABC$ is a right-angled triangle with right angle at $C$. This means that the circle centered at $M$ is tangent to both $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{BC}$ at $C$.\nStep 3:  We're also given that $AC=5$ and $BC=12$. We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of side $AB$. The theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\nStep 4:  Therefore, we have $AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2 = 5^2 + 12^2 = 25 + 144 = 169$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $AB = 13$.\nStep 5:  Now, let's consider the point of tangency of the circle with $\\overline{AB}$, which we'll call $D$. Since the circle is tangent to $\\overline{AB}$ at $D$, we know that $MD$ is perpendicular to $\\overline{AB}$.\nStep 6:  We can use the fact that the length of the tangent segment from an external point to a circle is equal to the length of the radius of the circle. Therefore, $MD = r$.\nStep 7:  We also know that $AD = AB - BD = 13 - BD$. Since $BD$ is the length of the tangent segment from $B$ to the circle, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find $BD$.\nStep 8:  We have $BD^2 = BC^2 - CD^2 = 12^2 - r^2 = 144 - r^2$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $BD = \\sqrt{144 - r^2}$.\nStep 9:  Now, we can use the fact that $AD = AB - BD = 13 - BD$ to find the length of $AD$. We have $AD = 13 - \\sqrt{144 - r^2}$.\nStep 10:  Since $MD$ is perpendicular to $\\overline{AB}$, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of $MD$. We have $MD^2 = AD^2 + BD^2 = (13 - \\sqrt{144 - r^2})^2 + (\\sqrt{144 - r^2})^2$.\nStep 11:  Simplifying the expression, we get $MD^2 = 169 - 26\\sqrt{144 - r^2} + 144 - r^2 = 313 - 26\\sqrt{144 - r^2}$.\nStep 12:  Since $MD = r$, we have $r^2 = 313 - 26\\sqrt{144 - r^2}$.\nStep 13:  Solving for $r$, we get $r^2 + 26\\sqrt{144 - r^2} = 313$.\nStep 14:  Squaring both sides, we get $r^4 + 676 - 52r^2\\sqrt{144 - r^2} + 144r^2 = 98569$.\nStep 15:  Simplifying the expression, we get $r^4 - 52r^2\\sqrt{144 - r^2} + 144r^2 + 676 = 98569$.\nStep 16:  Rearranging the terms, we get $r^4 - 52r^2\\sqrt{144 - r^2} + 144r^2 = 97993$.\nStep 17:  We can now use the quadratic formula to solve for $r^2$. We have $r^2 = \\frac{52\\sqrt{144 - r^2} - 144 \\pm \\sqrt{52^2(144 - r^2) - 4(144)(97993)}}{2}$.\nStep 18:  Simplifying the expression, we get $r^2 = \\frac{52\\sqrt{144 - r^2} - 144 \\pm \\sqrt{2704(144 - r^2) - 4(144)(97993)}}{2}$.\nStep 19:  We can now use the quadratic formula to solve for $r^2$. We have $r^2 = \\frac{52\\sqrt{144 - r^2} - 144 \\pm \\sqrt{388416 - 5624192 - 4431792}}{2}$.\nStep 20:  Simplifying the expression, we get $r^2 = \\frac{52\\sqrt{144 - r^2} - 144 \\pm \\sqrt{-3777368}}{2}$.\nStep 21:  Since the square root of a negative number is not a real number, we can conclude that there is no real solution for $r^2$.\nStep 22:  However, we can use the fact that $r^2 = 144 - BD^2$ to find the value of $r$. We have $r^2 = 144 - BD^2 = 144 - (12 - r)^2$.\nStep 23:  Simplifying the expression, we get $r^2 = 144 - 144 + 24r - r^2$.\nStep 24:  Rearranging the terms, we get $2r^2 - 24r = 0$.\nStep 25:  Factoring out $2r$, we get $2r(r - 12) = 0$.\nStep 26:  Therefore, we have two possible solutions: $r = 0$ or $r = 12$.\nStep 27:  However, since the radius of a circle cannot be zero, we can conclude that $r = 12$ is the only possible solution.\nStep 28:  Therefore, the value of the radius $r$ of the circle centered at $M$ is $\\boxed{12}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$",

A two-digit number in base $b$ can be represented as $ab$, where $a$ and $b$ are digits in base $b$.\nStep 3:  We are given that $T=41$, and we want to find the number of positive integers $b$ such that $41$ has exactly two digits when written in base $b$.\nStep 4:  This means that the base $b$ representation of $41$ should have two digits, which can be represented as $ab$.\nStep 5:  We can express this condition as the inequality $b^{2}>41\\geq b$, where $b$ is the base.\nStep 6:  To find the possible values of $b$, we need to solve this inequality.\nStep 7:  We start by finding the smallest integer $b$ such that $b^{2}>41$. This is the smallest integer greater than $\\sqrt{41}$, which is approximately $6.403$.\nStep 8:  The smallest integer greater than $6.403$ is $7$, so $b$ must be greater than or equal to $7$.\nStep 9:  Next, we need to find the largest integer $b$ such that $41\\geq b$.

We are also given that $AC-BC=T-1$, where $T=35$. Our goal is to find the area of triangle $ABC$, denoted as $[ABC]$.\nStep 2:  We can start by using the Pythagorean Theorem to relate the sides of the triangle. The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\nStep 3:  In this case, we have $AB^2=AC^2+BC^2$. We are given that $AB=40$, so we can substitute this value into the equation to get $40^2=AC^2+BC^2$.\nStep 4:  We are also given that $AC-BC=T-1$, where $T=35$. Substituting this value, we get $AC-BC=35-1=34$.\nStep 5:  We can use the equation $AC-BC=34$ to express $AC$ in terms of $BC$.

To do this, we need to compute $f(f(x))$ and then extract the coefficient of $x^{10}$ from the resulting expression.\nStep 4:  Substituting $f(x)$ into itself, we get $f(f(x)) = \\frac{\\frac{x}{1-x^2}}{1-\\left(\\frac{x}{1-x^2}\\right)^2}$.\nStep 5:  Simplifying this expression, we arrive at $f(f(x)) = \\frac{x(1-x^2)}{(1-x^2)(1-x^4)} = \\frac{x}{1-x^4}$.\nStep 6:  Further simplifying, we can express $f(f(x))$ as $\\frac{x}{1-x^4} = \\frac{x}{(1-x^2)^2}$.\nStep 7:  Now, we need to find the coefficient of $x^{10}$ in the expression $\\frac{x}{(1-x^2)^2}$.\nStep 8:  To do this, we can expand the denominator using the binomial series, which gives us $\\frac{x}{(1-x^2)^2} = x \\cdot \\frac{1}{(1-x^2)^2} = x \\cdot \\left( 1 + 2x^2 + 3x^4 + 4x^6 + 5x^8 + 6x^{10} + \\cdots \\right)$.\nStep 9:  From this expansion, we can see that the coefficient of $x^{10}$ is $\\boxed{6}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$",
  "Problem: Compute $\\left\\lfloor 100000(1.002)^{10}\\right\\rfloor$.\nStep 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first understand what the expression $\\left\\lfloor 100000(1.002)^{10}\\right\\rfloor$ represents. The symbol $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$, also known as the floor function.\nStep 2:  We are given the expression $100000(1.002)^{10}$, and we need to find the greatest integer less than or equal to this value.\nStep 3:  To simplify this, we can use the fact that $1.002$ can be expressed as $1 + 0.002$. This allows us to rewrite the expression as $100000(1 + 0.002)^{10}$.\nStep 4:  Using the binomial theorem, we can expand $(1 + 0.002)^{10}$ to get $1 + \\binom{10}{1} (0.002) + \\binom{10}{2} (0.002)^2 + \\dots + (0.002)^{10}$.\nStep 5:  We can then simplify this expression to get $1 + 0.02 + 0.0002 + \\dots + (0.002)^{10}$.\nStep 6:  The terms after the first two are all less than $0.0001$, so when we multiply by $100000$, they become less than $10$. This means that when we take the floor of the entire expression, we can ignore these terms.\nStep 7:  Therefore, we can approximate the value of the expression as $100000(1 + 0.02)$, which equals $100000 \\cdot 1.02$.\nStep 8:  Finally, we take the floor of this value to get the greatest integer less than or equal to $100000 \\cdot 1.02$.\nStep 9:  This gives us the final answer of $\\boxed{10200}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10200}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of geometric and arithmetic sequences.\nStep 2:  A geometric sequence is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio. In this case, the sequence $1, x, y$ is a geometric sequence, so we have $y = xr$ and $x = \\frac{1}{r}$, where $r$ is the common ratio.\nStep 3:  An arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers such that the difference between any two successive members is a constant. Here, the sequence $x, y, 3$ is an arithmetic sequence, so we have $y - x = 3 - y$, which simplifies to $2y = x + 3$.\nStep 4:  We can use these relationships to express $x$ and $y$ in terms of $r$ and then substitute these expressions into the equation $2y = x + 3$ to solve for $r$.\nStep 5:  Substituting $x = \\frac{1}{r}$ and $y = xr = \\frac{1}{r^2}$ into the equation $2y = x + 3$, we get $2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{r^2} = \\frac{1}{r} + 3$.\nStep 6:  Multiplying through by $r^2$ to clear the denominators, we obtain $2 = r + 3r^2$.\nStep 7:  Rearranging this equation gives us a quadratic equation in terms of $r$: $3r^2 + r - 2 = 0$.\nStep 8:  We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula: $r = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a = 3$, $b = 1$, and $c = -2$.\nStep 9:  Plugging in these values, we get $r = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 24}}{6} = \\frac{-1 \\pm 5}{6}$.\nStep 10:  This gives us two possible values for $r$: $r = \\frac{-1 + 5}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}$ and $r = \\frac{-1 - 5}{6} = -1$.\nStep 11:  We need to find the maximum value of $x + y$, so we should consider both possible values of $r$ and determine which one yields the larger sum.\nStep 12:  If $r = \\frac{2}{3}$, then $x = \\frac{1}{r} = \\frac{3}{2}$ and $y = xr = \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} = 1$.\nStep 13:  If $r = -1$, then $x = \\frac{1}{r} = -1$ and $y = xr = -1 \\cdot -1 = 1$.\nStep 14:  In both cases, we have $x + y = \\frac{3}{2} + 1 = \\frac{5}{2}$.\nStep 15:  Therefore, the maximum value of $x + y$ is $\\frac{5}{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{2}}",

  "Step 1:  The problem asks us to find the area enclosed by a taxicab ellipse with foci at $(0,5)$ and $(12,0)$, passing through the point $(1,-1)$.\nStep 2:  To start, we need to understand the definition of the taxicab distance and how it relates to the taxicab ellipse. The taxicab distance between two points $A$ and $B$ is given by $d(A, B) = |x_A - x_B| + |y_A - y_B|$. This is different from the Euclidean distance, which is the straight-line distance between two points.\nStep 3:  The taxicab ellipse is defined as the set of points $Q$ such that $d(A, Q) + d(B, Q) = s$, where $s$ is a given positive value. This means that for any point $Q$ on the ellipse, the sum of its distances to the foci $A$ and $B$ is equal to $s$.\nStep 4:  We are given that the taxicab ellipse passes through the point $(1,-1)$, and we need to find the area enclosed by this ellipse.\nStep 5:  To do this, we can use the fact that the taxicab ellipse is symmetric about the line $y = x$. This means that if a point $Q$ is on the ellipse, then the point $(x, y)$ is also on the ellipse.\nStep 6:  We can use this symmetry to find the equation of the taxicab ellipse. By considering the point $(1,-1)$, we can derive the equation of the ellipse in the first quadrant and then use symmetry to find the equation in the other quadrants.\nStep 7:  Once we have the equation of the ellipse, we can find the area enclosed by it by integrating the area of the individual rectangles that make up the ellipse.\nStep 8:  We can then use the symmetry of the ellipse to find the total area enclosed by the ellipse.\nStep 9:  By following these steps, we can find the area enclosed by the taxicab ellipse with foci at $(0,5)$ and $(12,0)$, passing through the point $(1,-1)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{72}$",

This means that the function $f$ is defined recursively, and each value of $f(n)$ depends on the two previous values, $f(n-1)$ and $f(n-2)$.\nStep 3:  We are also given that $f(1)=\\frac{f(2)}{512}$ and $\\frac{1}{f(1)}=2 f(2)$. These are the initial conditions that we need to use to find the values of $f(1)$ and $f(2)$.\nStep 4:  From the given relation, we can express $f(2)$ in terms of $f(1)$ as $f(2) = 512 f(1)$.\nStep 5:  Substituting this expression for $f(2)$ into the equation $\\frac{1}{f(1)}=2 f(2)$, we get $\\frac{1}{f(1)}=2 \\cdot 512 f(1)$.\nStep 6:  Solving for $f(1)$, we find that $f(1) = \\frac{1}{1024}$.\nStep 7:  Now that we have the value of $f(1)$, we can use the recursive relation to find the value of $f(2)$. Substituting $f(1) = \\frac{1}{1024}$ into the expression $f(2) = 512 f(1)$, we get $f(2) = 512 \\cdot \\frac{1}{1024} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nStep 8:  With the values of $f(1)$ and $f(2)$ determined, we can now use the recursive relation to find the value of $f(4)$. We have $f(4) = f(3) f(2)$, and we know that $f(3) = f(2) f(1)$. Substituting the values of $f(2)$ and $f(1)$, we get $f(3) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{1024} = \\frac{1}{2048}$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, $f(4) = f(3) f(2) = \\frac{1}{2048} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4096}$.\nStep 10:  Finally, we can use the value of $f(4)$ to compute $f(f(4))$.

We need to consider the symmetries of the 16-gon and the possible rotations and reflections that can be applied to the triangles.\nStep 4:  We start by considering the case where the three extended sides are equally spaced, which gives us a regular triangle. There are 16 ways to choose the first vertex, 8 ways to choose the second vertex, and 4 ways to choose the third vertex, resulting in a total of $16 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 4 = 512$ such triangles.\nStep 5:  Next, we consider the case where the three extended sides are equally spaced, but the triangle is isosceles. There are 16 ways to choose the first vertex, 8 ways to choose the second vertex, and 2 ways to choose the third vertex, resulting in a total of $16 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 2 = 256$ such triangles.\nStep 6:  We also need to consider the case where the three extended sides are equally spaced, but the triangle is equilateral.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to start by understanding the given scenario. We have two square tiles, each with an area of 9, placed one on top of the other. The top tile is then rotated about its center by an acute angle $\\theta$. We are asked to find the value of $\\sin \\theta+\\cos \\theta$ given that the area of the overlapping region is 8.\nStep 2:  First, we need to visualize the scenario and understand the geometric properties involved. The area of the overlapping region is given as 8, and we know that the area of the top tile is 9. This means that the area of the non-overlapping region is $9-8=1$.\nStep 3:  We can use the concept of the area of a square to find the side length of the non-overlapping region. Since the area of a square is given by the formula $s^2$, where $s$ is the side length, we can find the side length of the non-overlapping region by taking the square root of its area, which is $\\sqrt{1}=1$.\nStep 4:  Now, we can use the side length of the non-overlapping region to find the side length of the overlapping region. The side length of the overlapping region is the difference between the side length of the top tile and the side length of the non-overlapping region, which is $3-1=2$.\nStep 5:  Next, we can use the side length of the overlapping region to find the area of the overlapping region. The area of the overlapping region is given by the formula $s^2$, where $s$ is the side length. So, the area of the overlapping region is $2^2=4$.\nStep 6:  However, we are given that the area of the overlapping region is 8, which means that the side length of the overlapping region is actually $\\sqrt{8}=2\\sqrt{2}$.\nStep 7:  Now, we can use the side length of the overlapping region to find the values of $\\sin \\theta$ and $\\cos \\theta$. The sine of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the hypotenuse, and the cosine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the side adjacent to the angle to the length of the hypotenuse.\nStep 8:  In this case, the side length of the overlapping region is the side opposite the angle $\\theta$, and the side length of the top tile is the hypotenuse. So, we have $\\sin \\theta=\\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{3}$ and $\\cos \\theta=\\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{3}$.\nStep 9:  Finally, we can find the value of $\\sin \\theta+\\cos \\theta$ by adding the values of $\\sin \\theta$ and $\\cos \\theta$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{4\\sqrt{2}}{3}}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand what is being asked. We are given a triangle with vertices at $(1,1)$, $(B,7)$, and $(17,1)$, and we need to find the probability that a randomly selected point $(x,y)$ from the interior of this triangle satisfies the condition $x>A-1$.\nStep 2:  The first step is to determine the value of $A$ and $B$. $A$ is the sum of the digits of the number obtained from position 7, and $B$ is the sum of the digits of the number obtained from position 9. We are given that the number from position 7 is 7 and the number from position 9 is 9, so $A = 7$ and $B = 9$.\nStep 3:  Next, we need to find the area of the triangle. The base of the triangle is the distance between the points $(1,1)$ and $(17,1)$, which is $17-1=16$. The height of the triangle is the distance between the points $(B,7)$ and $(1,1)$, which is $7-1=6$. Therefore, the area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 16 \\times 6 = 48$.\nStep 4:  We then need to find the area of the trapezoid.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to start by understanding the properties of an isosceles trapezoid and how its area is calculated.\nStep 2:  The formula for the area of a trapezoid is given by $A = \\frac{1}{2}(b_1 + b_2)h$, where $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the lengths of the two bases, and $h$ is the height.\nStep 3:  We are given that the area of the trapezoid is $T+1 = 17$, the height is 2, and the shorter base is 3 units shorter than the longer base.\nStep 4:  Let's denote the length of the shorter base as $b_1$ and the length of the longer base as $b_2$. We can express the length of the shorter base as $b_1 = b_2 - 3$.\nStep 5:  Substituting the given values into the area formula, we get $\\frac{1}{2}(b_1 + b_2) \\cdot 2 = 17$, which simplifies to $b_1 + b_2 = 17$.\nStep 6:  We can now substitute $b_1 = b_2 - 3$ into the equation $b_1 + b_2 = 17$ to solve for $b_2$.

We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find this length. Let's denote the length of the congruent side as $s$. We have $s^2 = 2^2 + 4^2 = 20$, which gives us $s = \\sqrt{20} = 2\\sqrt{5}$.\nStep 9:  Finally, we need to find the sum of the length of the shorter base and the length of one of the congruent sides, which is $7 + 2\\sqrt{5}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7 + 2\\sqrt{5}}",
