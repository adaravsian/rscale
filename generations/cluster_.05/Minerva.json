  "## Step 1: Recall Snell's law\nSnell's law states that the ratio of the sines of the angles of incidence and refraction is equal to the ratio of the velocities of the two media, or equivalently, the inverse ratio of the indices of refraction. Mathematically, this can be expressed as $n_1 \\sin{\\theta_1} = n_2 \\sin{\\theta_2}$, where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the indices of refraction of the first and second media, respectively, and $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$ are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.\n\n## Step 2: Apply Snell's law to the given problem\nIn this problem, the light is incident on the surface of the water at an angle $\\theta_w$ with respect to the surface normal. The index of refraction of water is given as $n=1.3$. We want to find the angle of the light once it emerges from the water into the air, $\\theta_a$. Using Snell's law, we have $1.3 \\sin{\\theta_w} = \\sin{\\theta_a}$.\n\n## Step 3: Solve for $\\theta_a$\nTo find the angle of the light once it emerges from the water into the air, $\\theta_a$, we need to solve the equation $1.3 \\sin{\\theta_w} = \\sin{\\theta_a}$ for $\\theta_a$. This can be done by taking the inverse sine of both sides of the equation, which gives us $\\theta_a = \\arcsin{1.3 \\sin{\\theta_w}}$.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the critical angle\nThe critical angle is the critical value of $\\theta_w$ such that the light will not emerge from the water. This occurs when the angle of refraction, $\\theta_a$, is equal to 90 degrees. Using Snell's law, we can set up the equation $1.3 \\sin{\\theta_w} = \\sin{90^\\circ}$. Since $\\sin{90^\\circ} = 1$, we have $1.3 \\sin{\\theta_w} = 1$. To find the critical angle, we need to solve this equation for $\\theta_w$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for the critical angle\nTo find the critical angle, we need to solve the equation $1.3 \\sin{\\theta_w} = 1$ for $\\theta_w$. This can be done by taking the inverse sine of both sides of the equation, which gives us $\\sin^{-1}{1.3 \\sin{\\theta_w}} = 90^\\circ$. However, we need to express the critical angle in terms of inverse trigonometric functions, so we can write the critical angle as $\\theta_w = \\sin^{-1}{\\frac{1}{1.3}}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\sin^{-1}{\\frac{1}{1.3}}}$",

Therefore, we can approximate the ratio of the fluxes as $\\frac{F_{\\text{planet}}}{F_{\\text{star}}} = 0.02$.\nStep 6:  Substituting this value into the formula, we get: $\\Delta m = -2.5 \\log_{10} (0.02)$.\nStep 7:  Evaluating the logarithm, we find that $\\log_{10} (0.02) = -1.7$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the decrease in magnitude of the system during transits is: $\\Delta m = -2.5 \\times (-1.7) = 4.25$.\nStep 9:  However, we are asked to find the decrease in magnitude, which is the absolute value of the change in magnitude.

  "Step 1:  To find the mean free path for collisions among stars, we need to consider the average distance a star travels before colliding with another star.\nStep 2:  We are given the density of stars in the globular star cluster as $10^{6} \\mathrm{pc}^{-3}$, and we're told that the stars have the same radius as the Sun and an average speed of $10 \\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{sec}^{-1}$.\nStep 3:  First, we need to convert the density from stars per cubic parsec to stars per cubic centimeter. We know that $1 \\mathrm{~pc} = 3.08 \\times 10^{18} \\mathrm{~cm}$, so we can use this conversion factor to find the density in stars per cubic centimeter.\nStep 4:  The volume of a cube with a side length of $1 \\mathrm{~pc}$ is $(3.08 \\times 10^{18} \\mathrm{~cm})^3 = 2.83 \\times 10^{54} \\mathrm{~cm}^3$. Therefore, the density in stars per cubic centimeter is $10^{6} \\mathrm{pc}^{-3} \\times (2.83 \\times 10^{54} \\mathrm{~cm}^3 \\mathrm{pc}^{-3}) = 2.83 \\times 10^{50} \\mathrm{stars} \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$.\nStep 5:  Next, we need to calculate the mean free path, which is the average distance a star travels before colliding with another star. This can be found using the formula $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{n \\sigma}$, where $n$ is the number density of stars and $\\sigma$ is the cross-sectional area of a star.\nStep 6:  The cross-sectional area of a star is given by $\\pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius of the star. We're told that the stars have the same radius as the Sun, which is $6.96 \\times 10^{5} \\mathrm{~cm}$.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the cross-sectional area of a star is $\\pi (6.96 \\times 10^{5} \\mathrm{~cm})^2 = 1.53 \\times 10^{12} \\mathrm{~cm}^2$.\nStep 8:  Now, we can calculate the mean free path using the formula $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{n \\sigma}$.

  "## Step 1:  To find the angular resolution of the interferometer array for a source directly overhead, we first need to understand the concept of angular resolution in the context of radio interferometry.\n## Step 2:  The angular resolution of a single dish is given by the wavelength of the radio waves divided by the diameter of the dish. In this case, the wavelength is $1 \\mathrm{~cm}$ and the diameter of each dish is $1 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n## Step 3:  Therefore, the angular resolution of a single dish is $\\frac{1 \\mathrm{~cm}}{1 \\mathrm{~m}} = 0.01$ radians.\n## Step 4:  However, when we have an array of dishes, the angular resolution improves due to the combination of signals from multiple dishes. This is known as the \"interferometric\" effect.\n## Step 5:  The angular resolution of the interferometer array for a source directly overhead is given by the wavelength divided by the maximum baseline of the array, which is the distance between the two most separated dishes.\n## Step 6:  The maximum baseline is the diameter of the circle within which the dishes are distributed, which is $1 \\mathrm{~km}$.\n## Step 7:  Therefore, the angular resolution of the interferometer array for a source directly overhead is $\\frac{1 \\mathrm{~cm}}{1 \\mathrm{~km}} = 1 \\times 10^{-5}$ radians.\n## Step 8:  However, we need to consider the number of dishes in the array, which is 100. The actual angular resolution will be better than this due to the increased baseline.\n## Step 9:  The actual angular resolution is given by $\\frac{1 \\mathrm{~cm}}{1 \\mathrm{~km}} \\times \\sqrt{100} = 1 \\times 10^{-4}$ radians.\n## Step 10:  Therefore, the angular resolution of the interferometer array for a source directly overhead is $1 \\times 10^{-4}$ radians.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1 \\times 10^{-4}}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between absolute magnitude, apparent magnitude, and the distance to an object in astronomy.\nStep 2:  The absolute magnitude of an object is a measure of its intrinsic brightness, while the apparent magnitude is the brightness as seen from Earth. The difference between these two magnitudes is related to the distance to the object through the formula: $m - M = 5 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{d}{10} \\right)$, where $m$ is the apparent magnitude, $M$ is the absolute magnitude, and $d$ is the distance in parsecs.\nStep 3:  Given that the absolute magnitude of the star cluster is the same as that of the Sun, which is +5, and the distance to the cluster is 10 parsecs, we can use the formula to find the apparent magnitude of the cluster.\nStep 4:  Plugging in the values, we get: $m - 5 = 5 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{10}{10} \\right)$. However, this simplifies to $m - 5 = 0$, which means the apparent magnitude of the cluster is the same as its absolute magnitude, which is +5.\nStep 5:  Therefore, the combined magnitude of the cluster is also +5.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$",

The collision mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels before colliding with another molecule.\nStep 2:  The formula for the collision mean free path is given by $\\lambda=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}\\pi d^2 n}$, where $d$ is the collision cross section and $n$ is the number density of the molecules.\nStep 3:  Given that the collision cross section $d$ is $10^{-16} \\mathrm{~cm}^2$ and the number density $n$ is $10^{19} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$, we can substitute these values into the formula to find the collision mean free path.\nStep 4:  Substituting the given values, we get $\\lambda=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}\\pi(10^{-16} \\mathrm{~cm}^2)(10^{19} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3})}$.\nStep 5:  Simplifying this expression, we have $\\lambda=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}\\pi(10^{-16} \\mathrm{~cm}^2)(10^{19} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3})} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}\\pi(10^{-16+19})} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}\\pi(10^3)}$.\nStep 6:  Further simplifying, we get $\\lambda=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}\\pi(10^3)} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}\\pi} \\times 10^{-3}$.\nStep 7:  Evaluating the expression, we find that $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}\\pi} \\approx 0.224$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the collision mean free path is approximately $0.224 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{~cm}$.\nStep 9:  Rounding to one significant figure, the collision mean free path is approximately $2.2 \\times 10^{-4} \\mathrm{~cm}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2.2 \\times 10^{-4}}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the apparent magnitude of a star and its distance from Earth, as well as its luminosity.\nStep 2:  The apparent magnitude of a star is related to its luminosity and distance from Earth through the formula: $m_1 - m_2 = -2.5 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{L_1}{L_2} \\cdot \\frac{d_2^2}{d_1^2} \\right)$, where $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the apparent magnitudes of the two stars, $L_1$ and $L_2$ are their luminosities, and $d_1$ and $d_2$ are their distances from Earth.\nStep 3:  Given that the two stars have the same surface temperature, their luminosities are proportional to the square of their radii. Therefore, if the radius of star 1 is $2.5$ times larger than the radius of star 2, its luminosity is $2.5^2 = 6.25$ times larger.\nStep 4:  Additionally, we are told that star 1 is ten times farther away than star 2. This means that the distance of star 1 is $10$ times the distance of star 2.\nStep 5:  Substituting these values into the formula, we get: $m_1 - m_2 = -2.5 \\log_{10} \\left( 6.25 \\cdot \\frac{1}{100} \\right)$.\nStep 6:  Simplifying the expression inside the logarithm, we have: $m_1 - m_2 = -2.5 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{6.25}{100} \\right)$.\nStep 7:  Evaluating the logarithm, we get: $m_1 - m_2 = -2.5 \\log_{10} \\left( 0.0625 \\right)$.\nStep 8:  Using a calculator to find the value of the logarithm, we get: $m_1 - m_2 = -2.5 \\cdot (-1.2)$.\nStep 9:  Simplifying the expression, we have: $m_1 - m_2 = 3$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the absolute value of the difference in apparent magnitude between the two stars is $3$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$",
  "We are given a homogeneous distribution of objects, each of luminosity $L$, where $F$ is the flux at the observer, and $N$ is the number of objects observed per square degree on the sky. We want to find the slope of a $\\log N(>F)$ vs. $\\log F$ curve. To find the slope, we need to find the relationship between $N$ and $F$. We can start by considering the flux $F$ as a function of luminosity $L$ and distance $d$. The flux is given by $F = \\frac{L}{4 \\pi d^2}$. We can rearrange this equation to get $d = \\sqrt{\\frac{L}{4 \\pi F}}$. Now, we can consider the number of objects $N$ observed per square degree on the sky. We can assume that the objects are uniformly distributed in space, so the number of objects per unit volume is constant. Let's call this constant $n$. Then, the number of objects per square degree on the sky is given by $N = n \\cdot d^2$. Substituting the expression for $d$ in terms of $L$ and $F$, we get $N = n \\cdot \\frac{L}{4 \\pi F}$.

  "## Step 1:  The problem asks us to find a solution to the differential equation $\\ddot{x}+4 x=\\cos (2 t)$ using the Exponential Response Formula (ERF) with a complex replacement.\n## Step 2:  We start by assuming a solution of the form $x_{p}=e^{r t}$, where $r$ is a complex number. Substituting this into the differential equation, we get the characteristic equation $r^{2}+4=0$.\n## Step 3:  Solving the characteristic equation, we find that $r=\\pm 2 i$. Since the ERF with resonance is applicable when $p(r)=0$, we use the ERF with resonance to find the solution.\n## Step 4:  The ERF with resonance states that a solution to $p(D) x=A e^{r t}$ is given by $x_{p}=A \\frac{t e^{r t}}{p^{\\prime}(r)}$, as long as $\\left.p^{\\prime} ( r)\\right. \\neq 0$. In this case, $p(D)=D^{2}+4$ and $p^{\\prime}(r)=2 r$.\n## Step 5:  Substituting $r=\\pm 2 i$ into $p^{\\prime}(r)$, we get $p^{\\prime}(\\pm 2 i)=\\pm 4 i$. Since $p^{\\prime}(\\pm 2 i) \\neq 0$, we can proceed to find the solution using the ERF with resonance.\n## Step 6:  The solution is given by $x_{p}=A \\frac{t e^{r t}}{p^{\\prime}(r)}$. Substituting $r=\\pm 2 i$ and $p^{\\prime}(\\pm 2 i)=\\pm 4 i$, we get $x_{p}=\\frac{A t}{4 i} e^{\\pm 2 i t}$.\n## Step 7:  We can simplify this expression by using Euler's formula, which states that $e^{i \\theta}=\\cos \\theta+i \\sin \\theta$. Applying this to $e^{\\pm 2 i t}$, we get $e^{\\pm 2 i t}=\\cos (2 t) \\pm i \\sin (2 t)$.\n## Step 8:  Substituting this back into the expression for $x_{p}$, we get $x_{p}=\\frac{A t}{4 i}(\\cos (2 t) \\pm i \\sin (2 t))$.\n## Step 9:  We can simplify this expression further by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $i$, which gives us $x_{p}=\\frac{A t}{-4}(\\sin (2 t) \\pm i \\cos (2 t))$.\n## Step 10:  Finally, we can simplify this expression by combining the real and imaginary parts, which gives us $x_{p}=\\frac{A t}{4} \\sin (2 t) \\pm \\frac{A t}{4} i \\cos (2 t)$.\n## Step 11:  Since the problem asks for a solution to the differential equation $\\ddot{x}+4 x=\\cos (2 t)$, we need to find the real part of the solution, which is $\\frac{A t}{4} \\sin (2 t)$.\n## Step 12:  Therefore, the solution to the differential equation is $x(t)=\\frac{A t}{4} \\sin (2 t)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{t}{4} \\sin (2 t)}",
  "Step 1:  To solve the given ordinary differential equation (ODE) $\\ddot{x}-a^{2} x=0$, we first need to identify the type of ODE we are dealing with. This is a second-order linear homogeneous ODE with constant coefficients.\nStep 2:  The general form of such an ODE is $ay'' + by' + cy = 0$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants. In our case, the equation can be rewritten as $\\ddot{x} - a^2x = 0$, which matches the general form with $a=1$, $b=0$, and $c=-a^2$.\nStep 3:  The characteristic equation for this ODE is obtained by substituting $x = e^{rt}$ into the ODE, which leads to the equation $r^2 - a^2 = 0$. This is a quadratic equation in $r$.\nStep 4:  Solving the characteristic equation, we get $r^2 = a^2$, which gives us two roots: $r = a$ and $r = -a$.\nStep 5:  Since the roots are real and distinct, the general solution to the ODE is given by $x(t) = c_1 e^{at} + c_2 e^{-at}$, where $c_1$ and $c_2$ are arbitrary constants.\nStep 6:  We are given the initial conditions $x(0) = 1$ and $\\dot{x}(0) = 0$. We can use these conditions to determine the values of $c_1$ and $c_2$.\nStep 7:  Substituting $t=0$ into the general solution, we get $x(0) = c_1 + c_2 = 1$.\nStep 8:  To find $\\dot{x}(0)$, we differentiate the general solution with respect to $t$ to get $\\dot{x}(t) = ac_1 e^{at} - ac_2 e^{-at}$.\nStep 9:  Substituting $t=0$ into the expression for $\\dot{x}(t)$, we get $\\dot{x}(0) = ac_1 - ac_2 = 0$.\nStep 10:  Solving the system of equations $c_1 + c_2 = 1$ and $ac_1 - ac_2 = 0$, we find that $c_1 = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $c_2 = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the solution to the ODE that satisfies the given initial conditions is $x(t) = \\frac{1}{2} e^{at} + \\frac{1}{2} e^{-at}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2} e^{at} + \\frac{1}{2} e^{-at}}",

This means we need to find the first and second derivatives of $x(t)$ with respect to $t$.\nStep 3:  The first derivative of $x(t)$ is $\\dot{x} = \\dot{u} e^{-t} - u e^{-t}$, and the second derivative is $\\ddot{x} = \\ddot{u} e^{-t} - 2 \\dot{u} e^{-t} + u e^{-t}$.\nStep 4:  Substituting these derivatives into the original differential equation, we get $(\\ddot{u} e^{-t} - 2 \\dot{u} e^{-t} + u e^{-t}) + 3 (\\dot{u} e^{-t} - u e^{-t}) + 2 u e^{-t} = t e^{-t}$.\nStep 5:  Simplifying this expression, we obtain $(\\ddot{u} - 2 \\dot{u} + u) e^{-t} + (\\dot{u} - 3 u) e^{-t} + 2 u e^{-t} = t e^{-t}$.\nStep 6:  Factoring out $e^{-t}$, we have $e^{-t} (\\ddot{u} - 2 \\dot{u} + u + \\dot{u} - 3 u + 2 u) = t e^{-t}$.\nStep 7:  This simplifies to $e^{-t} (\\ddot{u} - u) = t e^{-t}$.\nStep 8:  Multiplying both sides by $e^t$, we get $\\ddot{u} - u = t$.\nStep 9:  We can solve this equation by first finding the general solution to the homogeneous equation $\\ddot{u} - u = 0$, which is $u_h = C_1 e^t + C_2 e^{-t}$.\nStep 10:  To find a particular solution, we assume $u_p = A t + B$ and substitute it into the equation $\\ddot{u} - u = t$.\nStep 11:  This gives us $A = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $B = 0$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the general solution to the equation $\\ddot{u} - u = t$ is $u(t) = C_1 e^t + C_2 e^{-t} + \\frac{1}{2} t$.\nStep 13:  Substituting this back into the expression $x(t) = u(t) e^{-t}$, we get $x(t) = (C_1 e^t + C_2 e^{-t} + \\frac{1}{2} t) e^{-t}$.\nStep 14:  Simplifying this expression, we obtain $x(t) = C_1 + C_2 + \\frac{1}{2} t$.\nStep 15:  Therefore, the solution to the differential equation $\\ddot{x}+3 \\dot{x}+2 x=t e^{-t}$ in the form $x(t)=u(t) e^{-t}$ is $x(t) = C_1 + C_2 + \\frac{1}{2} t$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2} t + C_1 + C_2}$",
  "Problem: If the complex number $z$ is given by $z = 1+\\sqrt{3} i$, what is the real part of $z^2$?\nStep 1:  To find the real part of $z^2$, we first need to calculate the value of $z^2$.\nStep 2:  The complex number $z$ is given by $z = 1+\\sqrt{3} i$.\nStep 3:  To find $z^2$, we use the formula $(a+bi)^2 = a^2 + 2abi + (bi)^2 = a^2 + 2abi - b^2$.\nStep 4:  Substituting the values of $a$ and $b$ from the given complex number, we get $z^2 = (1+\\sqrt{3} i)^2 = 1^2 + 2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot \\sqrt{3} i + (\\sqrt{3} i)^2$.\nStep 5:  Simplifying this expression, we get $z^2 = 1 + 2\\sqrt{3} i - 3$.\nStep 6:  Combining like terms, we have $z^2 = -2 + 2\\sqrt{3} i$.\nStep 7:  Now, we need to find the real part of $z^2$, which is the part that doesn't involve the imaginary unit $i$.\nStep 8:  The real part of $z^2$ is simply the coefficient of the real number part, which is $-2$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the real part of $z^2$ is $\\boxed{-2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-2}$",
  "Problem: Find a purely exponential solution of $\\frac{d^{4} x}{d t^{4}}-x=e^{-2 t}$.\nStep 1:  To find a purely exponential solution of the given differential equation $\\frac{d^{4} x}{d t^{4}}-x=e^{-2 t}$, we first assume that the solution has the form $x = e^{rt}$.\nStep 2:  Substituting this into the differential equation, we get the characteristic equation $r^4 - 1 = 0$.\nStep 3:  The roots of this characteristic equation are the values of $r$ that satisfy the equation $r^4 - 1 = 0$.\nStep 4:  We can factor the characteristic equation as $(r^2 - 1)(r^2 + 1) = 0$.\nStep 5:  This gives us two quadratic factors: $r^2 - 1 = 0$ and $r^2 + 1 = 0$.\nStep 6:  Solving $r^2 - 1 = 0$, we find the roots $r = \\pm 1$.\nStep 7:  Solving $r^2 + 1 = 0$, we find the roots $r = \\pm i$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the roots of the characteristic equation are $r = 1, -1, i, -i$.\nStep 9:  Since the roots are distinct, the general solution of the differential equation is given by $x = c_1 e^t + c_2 e^{-t} + c_3 \\cos t + c_4 \\sin t$.\nStep 10:  However, we are looking for a purely exponential solution, which means we want to exclude the terms involving $\\cos t$ and $\\sin t$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the purely exponential solution is given by $x = c_1 e^t + c_2 e^{-t}$.\nStep 12:  To find the values of $c_1$ and $c_2$, we need to use the initial conditions of the problem.\nStep 13:  However, the problem does not provide any initial conditions, so we cannot determine the specific values of $c_1$ and $c_2$.\nStep 14:  Therefore, the purely exponential solution of the differential equation is $x = c_1 e^t + c_2 e^{-t}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{c_1 e^t + c_2 e^{-t}}",

  "Step 1:  To find the general solution of the differential equation $\\ddot{x}+4 x=\\sin (3 t)$, we first need to find the complementary solution, which is the solution to the homogeneous equation $\\ddot{x}+4 x=0$.\nStep 2:  The characteristic equation for the homogeneous equation is $r^2+4=0$, which has roots $r=\\pm 2i$. This means the complementary solution is of the form $x_c(t)=c_1 \\cos (2 t)+c_2 \\sin (2 t)$, where $c_1$ and $c_2$ are arbitrary constants.\nStep 3:  Next, we need to find a particular solution, $x_p(t)$, which is a solution to the nonhomogeneous equation $\\ddot{x}+4 x=\\sin (3 t)$. We can find this by brute force. If $x=A \\sin (3 t)$, then $\\ddot{x}=-9 A \\sin (3 t)$, so $\\ddot{x}+4 x=-5 A \\sin (3 t)$. Therefore, when $A=-0.2$, $x_p(t)=-\\sin (3 t) / 5$ is a solution of the given equation.\nStep 4:  The general solution is the sum of the complementary solution and the particular solution, so the general solution is $x(t)=c_1 \\cos (2 t)+c_2 \\sin (2 t)-\\sin (3 t) / 5$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{c_1 \\cos (2 t)+c_2 \\sin (2 t)-\\sin (3 t) / 5}$",
  "Step 1:  To find the smallest possible positive $k$ such that all functions $x(t)=A \\cos (\\omega t-\\phi)$ satisfy $x(0)=0$, we need to consider the properties of the cosine function and the given condition.\nStep 2:  The condition $x(0)=0$ implies that when $t=0$, the value of the function $x(t)$ should be $0$. Substituting $t=0$ into the function $x(t)=A \\cos (\\omega t-\\phi)$ gives us $x(0)=A \\cos (-\\phi)$.\nStep 3:  Since $\\phi$ is an odd multiple of $k$, we can express $\\phi$ as $k$ for some odd integer $k$. Therefore, we have $x(0)=A \\cos (-k)$.\nStep 4:  For $x(0)$ to be $0$, the value of $A \\cos (-k)$ must be $0$. This means that $\\cos (-k)$ should be $0$.\nStep 5:  The cosine function is $0$ at odd multiples of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of relative motion and how it applies to Manny's situation.\nStep 2:  Manny is running towards first base at a speed $\\beta$, and we want to find out how fast he is running relative to the speed of light, $c$.\nStep 3:  The key piece of information given is that Manny sees third base $45^{\\circ}$ to his left, which means he is experiencing a change in his direction of motion due to his speed.\nStep 4:  We can use the concept of special relativity to analyze this situation. In special relativity, the speed of an object is relative to the observer, and the laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion relative to one another.\nStep 5:  Since Manny is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, we need to consider the effects of special relativity on his motion.\nStep 6:  The given information implies that Manny's speed is such that he is experiencing a significant change in his direction of motion, which is a characteristic of relativistic motion.\nStep 7:  To find Manny's speed, we can use the concept of the Lorentz transformation, which describes how space and time coordinates are affected by relative motion.\nStep 8:  However, in this case, we can simplify the problem by considering the geometry of the situation. Manny's speed is related to the angle at which he sees third base, which is $45^{\\circ}$ to his left.\nStep 9:  We can use trigonometry to relate the angle to Manny's speed. Since he sees third base at a $45^{\\circ}$ angle, we can use the tangent function to relate the angle to the ratio of his speed to the distance to third base.\nStep 10:  However, we are not given the distance to third base, so we need to use a different approach.\nStep 11:  We can use the fact that Manny's speed is a fraction of the speed of light, and the angle at which he sees third base is $45^{\\circ}$. This suggests that Manny's speed is related to the speed of light by a factor of $\\sqrt{2}$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, Manny's speed is $\\boxed{\\frac{c}{\\sqrt{2}}}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{c}{\\sqrt{2}}}$",

  "The age of the universe when most helium nuclei were formed is approximately 1 minute. This is because the universe was still in its very early stages, and the process of Big Bang nucleosynthesis was occurring. During this time, the universe was a hot and dense plasma, and the first light elements, including helium, were formed. This process occurred very quickly, and the universe was already about 1 minute old when most helium nuclei were formed. Therefore, the age of the universe when most helium nuclei were formed is approximately 1 minute. \n\nThe age of the universe when hydrogen atoms formed is a different story. Hydrogen atoms formed much later, during the recombination era, when the universe had cooled enough for electrons and protons to combine into neutral atoms. This process occurred when the universe was about 380,000 years old, which is approximately 6.3 x 10^12 seconds or 2.1 x 10^17 minutes. Therefore, the age of the universe when hydrogen atoms formed is approximately 2.1 x 10^17 minutes. \n\nHowever, the problem asks for the answer in years, so we need to convert 2.1 x 10^17 minutes to years.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to use Bragg's Law, which relates the wavelength of the radiation, the interplanar spacing of the crystal, and the angle of diffraction.\nStep 2:  First, we need to identify the given information: the wavelength of the $L_{\\alpha}$ radiation from tungsten, which is $\\lambda = 0.071 \\, \\text{nm}$, and the interplanar spacing of thorium, which is $d = 0.319 \\, \\text{nm}$ for the $4^{\\text {th }}$ reflection.\nStep 3:  We are asked to find the angle of diffraction, $\\theta$, for the $4^{\\text {th }}$ reflection.\nStep 4:  Bragg's Law is given by the equation $2d \\sin \\theta = n \\lambda$, where $n$ is the order of the reflection.\nStep 5:  We can rearrange this equation to solve for $\\theta$: $\\sin \\theta = \\frac{n \\lambda}{2d}$.\nStep 6:  Plugging in the given values, we get $\\sin \\theta = \\frac{4 \\times 0.071 \\, \\text{nm}}{2 \\times 0.319 \\, \\text{nm}}$.\nStep 7:  Simplifying this expression, we find $\\sin \\theta = \\frac{0.284 \\, \\text{nm}}{0.638 \\, \\text{nm}}$.\nStep 8:  Evaluating this, we get $\\sin \\theta = 0.446$.\nStep 9:  To find the angle $\\theta$, we take the inverse sine of $0.446$, which gives us $\\theta = \\sin^{-1}(0.446)$.\nStep 10:  Using a calculator, we find that $\\theta \\approx 26.74^{\\circ}$.\nStep 11:  Rounding this to 2 decimal places, we get $\\theta \\approx 26.74^{\\circ}$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the angle of the $4^{\\text {th }}$ reflection is approximately $26.74^{\\circ}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{26.74}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given information and what is being asked. We are given a metal with a Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) structure, a lattice constant of $3.31 \\AA$, and a density of $16.6 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{cm}^{3}$. We are tasked with determining the atomic weight of this element in g/mole, rounded to 1 decimal place.\nStep 2:  The first step is to calculate the volume of the unit cell. The lattice constant $a$ is given as $3.31 \\AA$, which is equivalent to $3.31 \\times 10^{-8} \\mathrm{~cm}$. The volume of the unit cell is calculated as $a^3$, which gives us $(3.31 \\times 10^{-8} \\mathrm{~cm})^3 = 3.54 \\times 10^{-23} \\mathrm{~cm}^3$.\nStep 3:  Next, we use the formula for density, which is $\\rho = \\frac{n \\cdot M}{N_A \\cdot V}$, where $\\rho$ is the density, $n$ is the number of atoms per unit cell, $M$ is the atomic weight, $N_A$ is Avogadro's number, and $V$ is the volume of the unit cell.\nStep 4:  We know that for a BCC structure, there are 2 atoms per unit cell. Rearranging the formula to solve for $M$, we get $M = \\frac{\\rho \\cdot N_A \\cdot V}{n}$.\nStep 5:  Substituting the given values, we have $M = \\frac{(16.6 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{cm}^3) \\cdot (6.02 \\times 10^{23} \\mathrm{~mol}^{-1}) \\cdot (3.54 \\times 10^{-23} \\mathrm{~cm}^3)}{2}$.\nStep 6:  Performing the calculation, we find that $M = 55.9 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the atomic weight of this element is $55.9 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$, rounded to 1 decimal place.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{55.9}$",

In general, silica glass is used in high-temperature applications such as furnace windows, heat exchangers, and refractory components. \n\n\\boxed{1000}",

  "Problem: Determine the highest linear density of atoms (atoms/m) encountered in vanadium (V). Please format your answer as $n \\times 10^x$ where $n$ is to 2 decimal places.\n## Step 1: Identify the atomic structure of vanadium\nVanadium is a chemical element with the atomic number 23 and the atomic symbol V. Its atomic structure consists of 23 protons, 28 neutrons, and 23 electrons.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the crystal structure of vanadium\nVanadium has a body-centered cubic (BCC) crystal structure. This means that each unit cell contains one atom at the center and eight atoms at the corners, with each atom sharing corners with eight neighboring atoms.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the lattice parameter of vanadium\nThe lattice parameter of vanadium is approximately 3.03 angstroms (\u00c5). This value represents the length of the edge of the unit cell.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the volume of the unit cell\nThe volume of the unit cell can be calculated by cubing the lattice parameter: V = (3.03 \u00c5)^3 = 27.52 \u00c5^3.\n\n## Step 5: Convert the volume from cubic angstroms to cubic meters\n1 \u00c5 = 10^-10 m, so 1 \u00c5^3 = (10^-10 m)^3 = 10^-30 m^3. Therefore, the volume of the unit cell in cubic meters is: V = 27.52 \u00c5^3 * (10^-30 m^3 / 1 \u00c5^3) = 2.752 * 10^-29 m^3.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the number of atoms per unit cell\nIn a BCC crystal structure, there is one atom at the center of the unit cell and eight atoms at the corners, but each corner atom is shared by eight unit cells. Therefore, the total number of atoms per unit cell is: N = 1 (center atom) + 8/8 (corner atoms) = 2 atoms.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the linear density of atoms\nThe linear density of atoms is the number of atoms per unit length. Since the unit cell has a volume of 2.752 * 10^-29 m^3 and contains 2 atoms, the volume per atom is: V/atom = 2.752 * 10^-29 m^3 / 2 = 1.376 * 10^-29 m^3/atom. The linear density of atoms can be calculated by taking the reciprocal of the volume per atom and multiplying by the number of atoms per unit length. However, since we are looking for the highest linear density, we need to consider the atoms along the edge of the unit cell. The edge length of the unit cell is 3.03 \u00c5, which is 3.03 * 10^-10 m. The number of atoms along this edge is 2 (since there is one atom at the center and one at each corner). Therefore, the linear density of atoms is: \u03c1 = 2 atoms / (3.03 * 10^-10 m) = 6.61 * 10^9 atoms/m.\n\n## Step 8: Format the answer as $n \\times 10^x$\nThe linear density of atoms is 6.61 * 10^9 atoms/m, which can be formatted as 6.61 * 10^9.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6.61 \\times 10^9}$",

  "Step 1:  To find the marginal rate of technical substitution (MRTS) of labor for capital, we need to understand what this concept represents. The MRTS is the rate at which a firm can substitute one input for another without changing the level of output. In this case, we're interested in the rate at which Sebastian can substitute labor for capital in his coffee factory.\nStep 2:  The production function given is $F(K, L) = (K-1)^{\\frac{1}{4}} L^{\\frac{1}{4}}$. This function shows how the output of the factory depends on the inputs of capital ($K$) and labor ($L$).\nStep 3:  To find the MRTS of labor for capital, we need to find the partial derivatives of the production function with respect to $K$ and $L$. The partial derivative of $F$ with respect to $K$ represents the rate of change of output with respect to capital, holding labor constant. Similarly, the partial derivative of $F$ with respect to $L$ represents the rate of change of output with respect to labor, holding capital constant.\nStep 4:  The partial derivative of $F$ with respect to $K$ is $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial K} = \\frac{1}{4}(K-1)^{-\\frac{3}{4}} L^{\\frac{1}{4}}$.\nStep 5:  The partial derivative of $F$ with respect to $L$ is $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial L} = \\frac{1}{4}(K-1)^{\\frac{1}{4}} L^{-\\frac{3}{4}}$.\nStep 6:  The MRTS of labor for capital is given by the ratio of the partial derivative of $F$ with respect to $L$ to the partial derivative of $F$ with respect to $K$. This is because it represents the rate at which labor can be substituted for capital to maintain the same level of output.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the MRTS of labor for capital is $\\frac{\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial L}}{\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial K}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{4}(K-1)^{\\frac{1}{4}} L^{-\\frac{3}{4}}}{\\frac{1}{4}(K-1)^{-\\frac{3}{4}} L^{\\frac{1}{4}}}$.\nStep 8:  Simplifying this expression, we get $\\frac{(K-1)^{\\frac{1}{4}} L^{-\\frac{3}{4}}}{(K-1)^{-\\frac{3}{4}} L^{\\frac{1}{4}}} = \\frac{L^{-\\frac{3}{4}}}{(K-1)^{-\\frac{3}{4}}} = \\left(\\frac{L}{K-1}\\right)^{\\frac{3}{4}}$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the marginal rate of technical substitution of labor for capital is $\\left(\\frac{L}{K-1}\\right)^{\\frac{3}{4}}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{L}{K-1}\\right)^{\\frac{3}{4}}}$",
  "The condition which involves the SRAC is that the SRAC is at a minimum. This is the condition that the firm is at a capital level that minimizes its costs in the long-term. The SRAC is at a minimum when the marginal cost (MC) is equal to the average variable cost (AVC). This is because the SRAC is the sum of the AVC and the fixed cost (FC), and when the MC is equal to the AVC, the SRAC is at its minimum. Therefore, the condition that involves the SRAC is that the SRAC is at a minimum, which is represented by the equation MC = AVC. \\boxed{0}",
