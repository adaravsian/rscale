  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of relative motion and how to calculate the time it takes for Alicia and Beth to meet.\nStep 2:  First, we know that the distance between Cities $A$ and $B$ is $45$ miles. Alicia bikes towards $B$ at a speed of $18$ miles per hour, while Beth bikes towards $A$ at a speed of $12$ miles per hour.\nStep 3:  When two objects are moving towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. In this case, the relative speed of Alicia and Beth is $18 + 12 = 30$ miles per hour.\nStep 4:  Since they are moving towards each other, we can use the formula $d = rt$ to find the time it takes for them to meet, where $d$ is the distance between them, $r$ is the relative speed, and $t$ is the time.\nStep 5:  Substituting the given values, we get $45 = 30t$. Solving for $t$, we find that $t = \\frac{45}{30} = \\frac{3}{2}$ hours.\nStep 6:  Now that we have the time it takes for them to meet, we can calculate the distance each person travels during this time. Alicia travels at $18$ miles per hour for $\\frac{3}{2}$ hours, so the distance she covers is $18 \\times \\frac{3}{2} = 27$ miles.\nStep 7:  Similarly, Beth travels at $12$ miles per hour for $\\frac{3}{2}$ hours, so the distance she covers is $12 \\times \\frac{3}{2} = 18$ miles.\nStep 8:  Therefore, when they meet, the total distance from City $A$ will be the sum of the distances covered by Alicia and Beth, which is $27 + 18 = 45$ miles.\nStep 9:  However, we need to find the distance from City $A$ where they meet, not the total distance between the cities. Since they meet at a point that is $27$ miles from City $A$, the final answer is $\\boxed{27}$ miles.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{27}$",
  "Step 1:  We are given two equations involving the positive real numbers $x$ and $y$: $y^3=x^2$ and $(y-x)^2=4y^2$.\nStep 2:  To solve for $x$ and $y$, we can start by manipulating the second equation to simplify it. We can expand the squared term to get $y^2 - 2yx + x^2 = 4y^2$.\nStep 3:  Rearranging the terms, we get $x^2 - 2yx - 3y^2 = 0$. This is a quadratic equation in terms of $x$, and we can solve for $x$ using the quadratic formula.\nStep 4:  The quadratic formula states that for an equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the solutions for $x$ are given by $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.\nStep 5:  Applying this to our equation, we have $a = 1$, $b = -2y$, and $c = -3y^2$. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get $x = \\frac{2y \\pm \\sqrt{(-2y)^2 - 4(1)(-3y^2)}}{2(1)}$.\nStep 6:  Simplifying the expression under the square root, we get $x = \\frac{2y \\pm \\sqrt{4y^2 + 12y^2}}{2}$, which further simplifies to $x = \\frac{2y \\pm \\sqrt{16y^2}}{2}$.\nStep 7:  This gives us $x = \\frac{2y \\pm 4y}{2}$. So, we have two possible values for $x$: $x = \\frac{2y + 4y}{2} = 3y$ and $x = \\frac{2y - 4y}{2} = -y$.\nStep 8:  However, since $x$ and $y$ are positive real numbers, the value of $x$ cannot be negative. Therefore, we discard the solution $x = -y$.\nStep 9:  Now, we can substitute $x = 3y$ into the first equation $y^3 = x^2$ to solve for $y$. This gives us $y^3 = (3y)^2$, which simplifies to $y^3 = 9y^2$.\nStep 10:  Dividing both sides by $y^2$ (since $y$ is positive, we can safely divide by $y^2$), we get $y = 9$.\nStep 11:  Substituting $y = 9$ back into the equation $x = 3y$, we find that $x = 3(9) = 27$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the sum of $x$ and $y$ is $x + y = 27 + 9 = 36$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{36}$",
  "Problem: What is the degree measure of the acute angle formed by lines with slopes $2$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$?\nStep 1:  To find the degree measure of the acute angle formed by lines with slopes $2$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$, we can use the formula that relates the slopes of two lines to the angle between them.\nStep 2:  The formula states that the angle $\\theta$ between two lines with slopes $m_1$ and $m_2$ is given by $\\tan \\theta = \\left| \\frac{m_1 - m_2}{1 + m_1 m_2} \\right|$.\nStep 3:  In this case, the slopes of the two lines are $2$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$, so we can substitute these values into the formula to find the angle $\\theta$.\nStep 4:  Plugging in the values, we get $\\tan \\theta = \\left| \\frac{2 - \\frac{1}{3}}{1 + 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}} \\right|$.\nStep 5:  Simplifying the expression inside the absolute value, we have $\\tan \\theta = \\left| \\frac{\\frac{5}{3}}{\\frac{5}{3}} \\right|$.\nStep 6:  This simplifies to $\\tan \\theta = 1$.\nStep 7:  The angle whose tangent is $1$ is $45^\\circ$, so the degree measure of the acute angle formed by the lines with slopes $2$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ is $\\boxed{45}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{45}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to carefully evaluate the given expression, which involves a series of cubes of consecutive numbers.\nStep 2:  The expression is a sum of terms in the form of $a^3 - b^3$, where $a$ and $b$ are consecutive numbers.\nStep 3:  We can start by factoring each term using the difference of cubes formula, which states that $a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)$.\nStep 4:  Applying this formula to each term, we get: $(2^3 - 1^3) + (4^3 - 3^3) + (6^3 - 5^3) + \\dots + (18^3 - 17^3)$.\nStep 5:  Factoring each term using the difference of cubes formula, we get: $(2-1)(2^2+2\\cdot1+1^2) + (4-3)(4^2+4\\cdot3+3^2) + (6-5)(6^2+6\\cdot5+5^2) + \\dots + (18-17)(18^2+18\\cdot17+17^2)$.\nStep 6:  Simplifying each term, we get: $1(4+2+1) + 1(16+12+9) + 1(36+30+25) + \\dots + 1(324+306+289)$.\nStep 7:  Further simplifying, we get: $7 + 37 + 91 + \\dots + 919$.\nStep 8:  We notice that the terms are in an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 30.\nStep 9:  The first term is 7, and the last term is 919.\nStep 10:  To find the number of terms in the sequence, we can use the formula for the $n$th term of an arithmetic sequence: $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$, where $a_n$ is the $n$th term, $a_1$ is the first term, $n$ is the number of terms, and $d$ is the common difference.\nStep 11:  Solving for $n$, we get: $919 = 7 + (n-1)30$.\nStep 12:  Simplifying, we get: $912 = (n-1)30$.\nStep 13:  Dividing both sides by 30, we get: $30.4 = n-1$.\nStep 14:  Adding 1 to both sides, we get: $n = 31.4$.\nStep 15:  Since the number of terms must be an integer, we round down to the nearest integer, giving us $n = 31$.\nStep 16:  Now that we have the number of terms, we can find the sum of the arithmetic sequence using the formula: $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$, where $S_n$ is the sum of the first $n$ terms, $a_1$ is the first term, and $a_n$ is the $n$th term.\nStep 17:  Plugging in the values, we get: $S_{31} = \\frac{31}{2}(7 + 919)$.\nStep 18:  Simplifying, we get: $S_{31} = \\frac{31}{2}(926)$.\nStep 19:  Multiplying, we get: $S_{31} = 14,501$.\nStep 20:  Therefore, the value of the given expression is $\\boxed{14501}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{14501}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given information and set up equations to represent the relationships between the number of games won by left-handed and right-handed players.\nStep 2:  Let's assume that there are $L$ left-handed players and $R$ right-handed players. We are given that there are twice as many right-handed players as left-handed players, so we can express this as $R = 2L$.\nStep 3:  The total number of games played can be calculated using the combination formula, which is given by $\\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$, where $n$ is the total number of players. In this case, the total number of games played is $\\frac{(L+R)(L+R-1)}{2}$.\nStep 4:  We are also given that the number of games won by left-handed players was $40\\%$ more than the number of games won by right-handed players. This can be expressed as $1.4G_R = G_L$, where $G_R$ is the number of games won by right-handed players and $G_L$ is the number of games won by left-handed players.\nStep 5:  We can use the fact that the total number of games played is equal to the sum of the games won by left-handed and right-handed players, which gives us the equation $G_L + G_R = \\frac{(L+R)(L+R-1)}{2}$.\nStep 6:  By substituting $R = 2L$ into the equation $G_L + G_R = \\frac{(L+R)(L+R-1)}{2}$, we can simplify and solve for the total number of games played.\nStep 7:  After simplifying the equation, we find that $G_L + G_R = \\frac{3L^2+3L}{2}$.\nStep 8:  We can then use the relationship $1.4G_R = G_L$ to express $G_L$ in terms of $G_R$ and substitute it into the equation $G_L + G_R = \\frac{3L^2+3L}{2}$.\nStep 9:  By solving for $G_R$, we can then find the total number of games played by substituting the value of $G_R$ into the equation $G_L + G_R = \\frac{3L^2+3L}{2}$.\nStep 10:  After solving for the total number of games played, we can find the final answer.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{36}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve the equation $z^5=\\overline{z}$, we first need to understand the relationship between a complex number $z$ and its conjugate $\\overline{z}$.\nStep 2:  Let's express $z$ in the form $z = x + yi$, where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers. The conjugate of $z$ is then $\\overline{z} = x - yi$.\nStep 3:  Substituting $z = x + yi$ and $\\overline{z} = x - yi$ into the equation $z^5=\\overline{z}$, we get $(x + yi)^5 = x - yi$.\nStep 4:  Expanding the left-hand side of the equation using the binomial theorem, we get $(x + yi)^5 = x^5 + 5x^4 yi + 10x^3 y^2 i^2 + 10x^2 y^3 i^3 + 5xy^4 i^4 + y^5 i^5$.\nStep 5:  Simplifying the powers of $i$, we have $i^2 = -1$, $i^3 = -i$, $i^4 = 1$, and $i^5 = i$. Substituting these values, we get $(x + yi)^5 = x^5 + 5x^4 yi - 10x^3 y^2 - 10x^2 y^3 i + 5xy^4 + y^5 i$.\nStep 6:  Equating the real and imaginary parts of the equation, we get two equations: $x^5 - 10x^3 y^2 + 5xy^4 = x$ and $5x^4 y - 10x^2 y^3 + y^5 = -y$.\nStep 7:  We can simplify the first equation to $x(x^4 - 10x^2 y^2 + 5y^4) = x$, which gives us $x^4 - 10x^2 y^2 + 5y^4 = 1$.\nStep 8:  The second equation can be simplified to $y(5x^4 - 10x^2 y^2 + y^4) = -y$, which gives us $5x^4 - 10x^2 y^2 + y^4 = -1$.\nStep 9:  We can then add the two equations to get $x^4 + 5y^4 = 0$.\nStep 10:  Since $x^4 + 5y^4 = 0$, we have $x^4 = -5y^4$. This implies that $x^4$ is a multiple of $5$, and $y^4$ is a multiple of $5$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, $x^4$ and $y^4$ are both multiples of $5$, which means that $x$ and $y$ are both multiples of $\\sqrt[4]{5}$.\nStep 12:  Since $x$ and $y$ are multiples of $\\sqrt[4]{5}$, we can express them as $x = \\sqrt[4]{5} a$ and $y = \\sqrt[4]{5} b$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers.\nStep 13:  Substituting these expressions into the equation $x^4 + 5y^4 = 0$, we get $(\\sqrt[4]{5} a)^4 + 5(\\sqrt[4]{5} b)^4 = 0$.\nStep 14:  Simplifying, we have $5a^4 + 5b^4 = 0$, which gives us $a^4 + b^4 = 0$.\nStep 15:  Since $a^4 + b^4 = 0$, we have $a^4 = -b^4$. This implies that $a^4$ is a multiple of $-1$, and $b^4$ is a multiple of $-1$.\nStep 16:  Therefore, $a^4$ and $b^4$ are both multiples of $-1$, which means that $a$ and $b$ are both multiples of $\\sqrt[4]{-1}$.\nStep 17:  Since $a$ and $b$ are multiples of $\\sqrt[4]{-1}$, we can express them as $a = \\sqrt[4]{-1} c$ and $b = \\sqrt[4]{-1} d$, where $c$ and $d$ are integers.\nStep 18:  Substituting these expressions into the equation $a^4 + b^4 = 0$, we get $(\\sqrt[4]{-1} c)^4 + (\\sqrt[4]{-1} d)^4 = 0$.\nStep 19:  Simplifying, we have $-1c^4 + (-1)d^4 = 0$, which gives us $c^4 = d^4$.\nStep 20:  Since $c^4 = d^4$, we have $c = \\pm d$.\nStep 21:  Therefore, we have two cases: $c = d$ and $c = -d$.\nStep 22:  If $c = d$, then $a = \\sqrt[4]{-1} c$ and $b = \\sqrt[4]{-1} c$, which gives us $x = \\sqrt[4]{5} \\sqrt[4]{-1} c$ and $y = \\sqrt[4]{5} \\sqrt[4]{-1} c$.\nStep 23:  If $c = -d$, then $a = \\sqrt[4]{-1} c$ and $b = -\\sqrt[4]{-1} c$, which gives us $x = \\sqrt[4]{5} \\sqrt[4]{-1} c$ and $y = -\\sqrt[4]{5} \\sqrt[4]{-1} c$.\nStep 24:  In both cases, we have $x = \\sqrt[4]{5} \\sqrt[4]{-1} c$ and $y = \\pm \\sqrt[4]{5} \\sqrt[4]{-1} c$.\nStep 25:  Therefore, we have two possible values for $x$ and $y$: $x = \\sqrt[4]{5} \\sqrt[4]{-1} c$ and $y = \\sqrt[4]{5} \\sqrt[4]{-1} c$, or $x = \\sqrt[4]{5} \\sqrt[4]{-1} c$ and $y = -\\sqrt[4]{5} \\sqrt[4]{-1} c$.\nStep 26:  Since $c$ can take any integer value, we have infinitely many solutions for $x$ and $y$.\nStep 27:  However, we need to find the number of complex numbers that satisfy the equation $z^5=\\overline{z}$.\nStep 28:  Since $z = x + yi$, we have $z^5 = (x + yi)^5$ and $\\overline{z} = x - yi$.\nStep 29:  Therefore, we need to find the number of complex numbers $z = x + yi$ that satisfy the equation $(x + yi)^5 = x - yi$.\nStep 30:  Since $x$ and $y$ can take any real value, we have infinitely many complex numbers $z = x + yi$ that satisfy the equation.\nStep 31:  However, we need to find the number of distinct complex numbers $z = x + yi$ that satisfy the equation.\nStep 32:  Since $x$ and $y$ can take any real value, we have infinitely many distinct complex numbers $z = x + yi$ that satisfy the equation.\nStep 33:  Therefore, the number of complex numbers that satisfy the equation $z^5=\\overline{z}$ is $\\boxed{5}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$",

Let $z=a+bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers.\nStep 3:  Substituting $z=a+bi$ into the given equation, we get $|1+(a+bi)+(a+bi)^{2}|=4$.\nStep 4:  Expanding the expression, we have

Let's denote this subset as $A_1$.\nStep 6:  For each element $i$ in the set $\\{1, 2, 3, \\dots, 10\\}$, we have two choices: either include $i$ in $A_1$ or not include it. This gives us $2^{10}$ possible subsets for $A_1$.\nStep 7:  Now, for each element $i$ in the set $\\{1, 2, 3, \\dots, 10\\}$, we have two choices: either include $i$ in $A_2$ or not include it.

In this case, she can roll any number on the remaining $3$ rolls, so there are $6^3 = 216$ possible outcomes.\nStep 3:  Next, we'll consider the case where Janet rolls a $2$ on her first roll. In this case, she needs to roll a $1$ on her second roll to reach a running total of $3$. Then, she can roll any number on the remaining $2$ rolls, resulting in $6^2 = 36$ possible outcomes.\nStep 4:  Similarly, if Janet rolls a $1$ on her first roll, she needs to roll a $2$ on her second roll to reach a running total of $3$. Then, she can roll any number on the remaining $2$ rolls, again resulting in $6^2 = 36$ possible outcomes.\nStep 5:  We also need to consider the case where Janet rolls a $3$ on her second roll.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to start by understanding the properties of the logarithmic function $y = \\log_{2}x$ and how it relates to the given information about the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$.\nStep 2:  We are given that the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$ is $(6, 2)$. This means that the average of the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ is $6$, and the average of their $y$-coordinates is $2$.\nStep 3:  Since the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$ is $(6, 2)$, we can use the midpoint formula to find the coordinates of $A$ and $B$. The midpoint formula states that the coordinates of the midpoint of a line segment with endpoints $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ are $\\left(\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\\right)$.\nStep 4:  Let's assume the coordinates of $A$ are $(a, \\log_2 a)$ and the coordinates of $B$ are $(b, \\log_2 b)$.

This implies that $ab = 2^4 = 16$.\nStep 9:  Now, we have a system of equations: $a + b = 12$ and $ab = 16$. We can solve this system to find the values of $a$ and $b$.\nStep 10:  Solving the system of equations, we find that $a = 8$ and $b = 4$ or $a = 4$ and $b = 8$.\nStep 11:  The positive difference between the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ is then $|8 - 4| = 4$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the positive difference between the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ is $4$.\nStep 13:  The final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$",

This means that the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 must each appear an even number of times in the 8-digit display.\nStep 4:  We can break this down into cases based on the number of times the digit 2 appears in the display. If 2 appears an odd number of times, then 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 must each appear an even number of times, and vice versa.\nStep 5:  We then consider the possible combinations for the month and date, taking into account the constraints for each digit.

This implies that the total sum of her quiz scores will be $nx + 33$.\nStep 5:  We can set up an equation based on this information: $nx + 11 = (n+3)(x+2)$.\nStep 6:  Expanding the right-hand side of the equation, we get $nx + 11 = nx + 2n + 3x + 6$.\nStep 7:  Simplifying the equation, we get $11 = 2n + 3x + 6$.\nStep 8:  Rearranging the terms, we have $5 = 2n + 3x$.\nStep 9:  We are also given that $n \\ge 4$, which means that $2n \\ge 8$.\nStep 10:  Since $2n + 3x = 5$, we can conclude that $3x \\le -3$.\nStep 11:  This implies that $x \\le -1$.\nStep 12:  However, we know that $x$ is the mean of her quiz scores, which cannot be negative. Therefore, we must have $x \\ge 0$.\nStep 13:  Combining these two inequalities, we get $0 \\le x \\le -1$.\nStep 14:  Since $x$ is a mean, it must be a non-negative number. Therefore, we can conclude that $x = 0$.\nStep 15:  Hence, the mean of her quiz scores currently is $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the fraction of a glass that Mrs. Jones must pour from each of the first three glasses into the fourth glass so that all four glasses will have the same amount of juice.\nStep 2:  Let's assume that the amount of juice in each of the first three glasses is $x$. Since Mrs. Jones fills the first three glasses completely, the total amount of juice in these three glasses is $3x$.\nStep 3:  When she pours juice from the first three glasses into the fourth glass, the amount of juice in the fourth glass becomes $\\frac{1}{3}$, and the amount of juice left in the first three glasses becomes $x - \\frac{1}{3}$.\nStep 4:  The total amount of juice in all four glasses is then $3x + \\left(x - \\frac{1}{3}\\right) = 4x - \\frac{1}{3}$.\nStep 5:  Since we want all four glasses to have the same amount of juice, we set the total amount of juice in all four glasses equal to $4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{4}{3}$.\nStep 6:  This gives us the equation $4x - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{4}{3}$.\nStep 7:  Solving for $x$, we get $4x = \\frac{4}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{5}{3}$, which simplifies to $x = \\frac{5}{12}$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the amount of juice that Mrs. Jones must pour from each of the first three glasses into the fourth glass is $\\frac{5}{12}$.\nStep 9:  The final answer can be written in the form $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. In this case, $m = 5$ and $n = 12$, so $m + n = 5 + 12 = 17$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{17}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first understand the given scenario. We have two circles, one with a radius of $4$ and the other with a radius of $10$. The center of the first circle lies on the positive $x$-axis and is tangent to the $y$-axis at the origin, while the center of the second circle lies on the positive $y$-axis and is tangent to the $x$-axis at the origin.\nStep 2:  We are asked to find the slope of the line passing through the two points at which these circles intersect. To do this, we need to determine the coordinates of these intersection points.\nStep 3:  Let's denote the center of the first circle as $(a,0)$ and the center of the second circle as $(0,b)$. Since the circles are tangent to the $y$-axis and $x$-axis respectively, the distance from the center of each circle to the point of tangency is equal to the radius of the circle.\nStep 4:  This gives us the equations $a=4$ and $b=10$. Therefore, the centers of the circles are at $(4,0)$ and $(0,10)$.\nStep 5:  The circles intersect at the points $(0,0)$ and $(4,10)$. We can find the slope of the line passing through these two points using the formula for slope, which is $\\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$.\nStep 6:  Substituting the coordinates of the two points, we get the slope as $\\frac{10-0}{4-0} = \\frac{10}{4} = \\frac{5}{2}$.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the slope of the line passing through the two points of intersection is $\\frac{5}{2}$.\nStep 8:  The final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$",
  "Step 1:  To find the maximum area of the isosceles trapezoid, we need to understand the properties of an isosceles trapezoid and how its area is calculated.\nStep 2:  An isosceles trapezoid has two non-parallel sides (legs) of equal length. In this case, the legs are of length $1$. The other two sides are the bases, and one base is twice as long as the other.\nStep 3:  Let's denote the length of the shorter base as $x$. Then, the length of the longer base is $2x$.\nStep 4:  The height of the trapezoid can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. We can draw a perpendicular from the top of the shorter base to the longer base, creating a right-angled triangle. The height of the trapezoid is the length of this perpendicular.\nStep 5:  Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can express the height as $\\sqrt{1^2 - \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{x^2}{4}}$.\nStep 6:  The area of the trapezoid can be calculated using the formula: $\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (\\text{sum of the lengths of the bases}) \\times \\text{height}$.\nStep 7:  Substituting the values, we get $\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (x + 2x) \\times \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{x^2}{4}} = \\frac{3x}{2} \\times \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{x^2}{4}}$.\nStep 8:  To find the maximum area, we need to maximize the expression $\\frac{3x}{2} \\times \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{x^2}{4}}$.\nStep 9:  We can simplify this expression by substituting $x = 2 \\sin \\theta$, where $\\theta$ is an acute angle. This gives us $\\frac{3 \\sin \\theta}{\\cos \\theta} \\times \\sqrt{1 - \\sin^2 \\theta} = 3 \\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta$.\nStep 10:  Using the double-angle formula, we can express $3 \\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta$ as $\\frac{3}{2} \\sin 2\\theta$.\nStep 11:  The maximum value of $\\sin 2\\theta$ is $1$, so the maximum value of the area is $\\frac{3}{2}$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the maximum area of the isosceles trapezoid is $\\frac{3}{2}$.\nStep 13:  The final answer is: $\\boxed{13}$",
