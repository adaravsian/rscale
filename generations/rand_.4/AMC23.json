  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of relative motion and how to calculate the time it takes for Alicia and Beth to meet.\nStep 2:  First, we note that the distance between Cities $A$ and $B$ is $45$ miles. Alicia bikes towards $B$ at a speed of $18$ miles per hour, while Beth bikes towards $A$ at a speed of $12$ miles per hour.\nStep 3:  When they meet, the sum of the distances traveled by Alicia and Beth will be equal to the total distance between the cities, which is $45$ miles.\nStep 4:  Let's denote the time it takes for them to meet as $t$ hours. In this time, Alicia will have traveled a distance of $18t$ miles, and Beth will have traveled a distance of $12t$ miles.\nStep 5:  Since the sum of their distances traveled is equal to the total distance between the cities, we can set up the equation $18t + 12t = 45$ to represent this situation.\nStep 6:  Solving for $t$, we get $30t = 45$, which gives us $t = \\frac{45}{30} = \\frac{3}{2}$ hours.\nStep 7:  Now that we have the time it takes for them to meet, we can calculate the distance traveled by Alicia. The distance traveled by Alicia is given by the product of her speed and the time taken, which is $18 \\times \\frac{3}{2} = 27$ miles.\nStep 8:  Therefore, when they meet, Alicia will be $27$ miles from City $A$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{27}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given equations and use algebraic manipulations to find the values of $x$ and $y$.\nStep 2:  We are given two equations: $y^3=x^2$ and $(y-x)^2=4y^2$. Our goal is to find the value of $x+y$.\nStep 3:  Let's start by examining the second equation, $(y-x)^2=4y^2$. Expanding this equation gives us $y^2-2yx+x^2=4y^2$.\nStep 4:  Rearranging the terms, we get $x^2-2yx-3y^2=0$. This is a quadratic equation in terms of $x$, and we can solve for $x$ using the quadratic formula.\nStep 5:  The quadratic formula states that for an equation of the form $ax^2+bx+c=0$, the solutions for $x$ are given by $x=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$.\nStep 6:  Applying this to our equation $x^2-2yx-3y^2=0$, we have $a=1$, $b=-2y$, and $c=-3y^2$. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula gives us $x=\\frac{2y\\pm\\sqrt{4y^2+12y^2}}{2}=\\frac{2y\\pm\\sqrt{16y^2}}{2}=\\frac{2y\\pm4y}{2}$.\nStep 7:  This simplifies to $x=y+2$ or $x=y-2$.\nStep 8:  Now, we can substitute these expressions for $x$ into the first equation $y^3=x^2$ to solve for $y$.\nStep 9:  If $x=y+2$, then $y^3=(y+2)^2=y^2+4y+4$. This simplifies to $y^3-y^2-4y-4=0$.\nStep 10:  Factoring this equation gives us $(y-2)(y^2+2y+2)=0$. Since $y$ is positive, we can discard the quadratic factor, and we're left with $y-2=0$, which gives us $y=2$.\nStep 11:  Substituting $y=2$ into the equation $x=y+2$ gives us $x=4$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the sum $x+y$ is $4+2=\\boxed{6}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given information and set up an equation to represent the situation.\nStep 2:  We are told that the weight of $\\frac{1}{3}$ of a large pizza together with $3 \\frac{1}{2}$ cups of orange slices is the same as the weight of $\\frac{3}{4}$ of a large pizza together with $\\frac{1}{2}$ cup of orange slices.\nStep 3:  Let's denote the weight of the large pizza as $p$ and the weight of a cup of orange slices as $o$. We are given that $o = \\frac{1}{4}$ of a pound.\nStep 4:  We can now set up an equation based on the given information. The weight of $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the pizza and $3 \\frac{1}{2}$ cups of orange slices is equal to the weight of $\\frac{3}{4}$ of the pizza and $\\frac{1}{2}$ cup of orange slices. This can be represented as: $\\frac{1}{3}p + 3\\frac{1}{2}o = \\frac{3}{4}p + \\frac{1}{2}o$.\nStep 5:  We can simplify the equation by converting the mixed number $3 \\frac{1}{2}$ to an improper fraction, which is $\\frac{7}{2}$. Substituting this into the equation gives us: $\\frac{1}{3}p + \\frac{7}{2}o = \\frac{3}{4}p + \\frac{1}{2}o$.\nStep 6:  We know that $o = \\frac{1}{4}$, so we can substitute this value into the equation to get: $\\frac{1}{3}p + \\frac{7}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}p + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}$.\nStep 7:  Simplifying the equation further, we get: $\\frac{1}{3}p + \\frac{7}{8} = \\frac{3}{4}p + \\frac{1}{8}$.\nStep 8:  To solve for $p$, we need to isolate the variable. We can start by subtracting $\\frac{1}{8}$ from both sides of the equation to get: $\\frac{1}{3}p + \\frac{6}{8} = \\frac{3}{4}p$.\nStep 9:  Next, we can multiply both sides of the equation by $24$ to clear the fractions, resulting in: $8p + 18 = 18p$.\nStep 10:  By subtracting $8p$ from both sides, we get: $18 = 10p$.\nStep 11:  Finally, we can solve for $p$ by dividing both sides by $10$, giving us: $p = \\frac{18}{10}$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the weight of a large pizza is $\\frac{18}{10}$ pounds.\nStep 13:  To find the final answer, we need to calculate $m-n$, where $m$ and $n$ are the numerator and denominator of the fraction representing the weight of the pizza, respectively.\nStep 14:  The numerator $m$ is $18$ and the denominator $n$ is $10$, so $m-n = 18-10 = 8$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$",

This is because when we add the units digits of the numbers in each row, we get a sum of 1.\nStep 4:  Now, we need to find the units digit of the sum of the 2023rd row. Since the units digit of the sum of the numbers in each row is 1, the units digit of the sum of the 2023rd row will also be 1.\nStep 5:  Therefore, the units digit of the sum of the 2023 numbers in the 2023rd row is $\\boxed{1}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

Each vertex is connected to 5 edges, and each edge connects 2 vertices.\nStep 3:  We are asked to find the probability that the distance between vertices $Q$ and $R$ is greater than the distance between vertices $R$ and $S$.\nStep 4:  To approach this, we can consider the possible distances between vertices and how they relate to each other.\nStep 5:  The distance between any two vertices in the icosahedron can be 1, 2, or 3, as there are no vertices that are 4 or more edges apart.\nStep 6:  We can use the fact that the icosahedron is symmetric and that the vertices are randomly chosen to simplify the problem.\nStep 7:  We can consider the cases where $d(Q, R) = 1$ and $d(R, S) = 1$, where $d(Q, R) = 1$ and $d(R, S) = 2$, and where $d(Q, R) = 1$ and $d(R, S) = 3$.\nStep 8:  By considering these cases, we can determine the number of possible combinations of distances and calculate the probability for each case.\nStep 9:  We can then use the symmetry of the icosahedron to find the total number of possible combinations of distances and calculate the overall probability.\nStep 10:  Finally, we can use the calculated probability to find the final answer in the form of $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.\n\nStep 11:  Now, let's calculate the number of possible combinations of distances for each case and find the total number of possible combinations of distances.\nStep 12:  We can then use this information to calculate the overall probability and find the final answer.\n\nStep 13:  After considering the cases and calculating the number of possible combinations of distances, we find that there are 12 possible combinations of distances.\nStep 14:  Out of these 12 combinations, 6 satisfy the condition $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$.\nStep 15:  Therefore, the probability that $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$ is $\\frac{6}{12} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nStep 16:  The final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$",

The sales tax on this price would be $0.075x$.\nStep 3:  Since Carlos had to pay the sales tax on the discounted price, we can express the total amount he paid as the discounted price plus the sales tax, which gives us the equation $x + 0.075x = 43$.\nStep 4:  Solving for $x$, we get $1.075x = 43$, and then $x = \\frac{43}{1.075} = 40$.\nStep 5:  This means that the discounted price of the shoes is $40. Now, we need to find the original price before the $20\\%$ discount was applied.\nStep 6:  Let's denote the original price as $y$. The discounted price is $80\\%$ of the original price, so we have the equation $0.8y = 40$.\nStep 7:  Solving for $y$, we get $y = \\frac{40}{0.8} = 50$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the original price of the most expensive shoes Carlos could afford to buy is $\\boxed{50}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{50}$",

However, we are given that the product can be any of $936$ possible values.\nStep 4:  To find the value of $n$, we need to determine the value of $x$ such that $6^x = 936$.\nStep 5:  We can start by finding the prime factorization of $936$, which is $2^5 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 13$.\nStep 6:  Since $6 = 2 \\cdot 3$, we can express $6^x$ as $(2 \\cdot 3)^x = 2^x \\cdot 3^x$.\nStep 7:  By comparing the prime factorization of $936$ with the expression $2^x \\cdot 3^x$, we can see that $x$ must be equal to $5$ in order for the equation to hold true.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the value of $n$ is $\\boxed{5}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$",
  "Step 1:  To find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$, we need to understand the given relations and how they relate to the lcm (least common multiple) and gcd of these numbers.\nStep 2:  The given relations provide us with information about the prime factorization of the lcm of different pairs of numbers. We can use this information to determine the prime factorization of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$.\nStep 3:  We start by analyzing the relation $\\text{lcm}(a,b)=2^3\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 5^3$. This tells us that the highest power of $2$ that divides both $a$ and $b$ is $2^3$, the highest power of $3$ is $3^2$, and the highest power of $5$ is $5^3$.\nStep 4:  Similarly, we can analyze the other given relations to determine the prime factorization of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$.\nStep 5:  From the given relations, we can deduce that $a$ must be divisible by $2^3\\cdot 3^3\\cdot 5^3$ and $b$ must be divisible by $2^3\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 5^3$. This implies that $a$ and $b$ have a common factor of $2^3\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 5^3$.\nStep 6:  Similarly, we can deduce that $a$ and $c$ have a common factor of $2^3\\cdot 3^3\\cdot 5^3$, $a$ and $d$ have a common factor of $2^3\\cdot 3^3\\cdot 5^3$, and $b$ and $c$ have a common factor of $2^1\\cdot 3^3\\cdot 5^2$.\nStep 7:  We can also deduce that $b$ and $d$ have a common factor of $2^2\\cdot 3^3\\cdot 5^2$ and $c$ and $d$ have a common factor of $2^2\\cdot 3^3\\cdot 5^2$.\nStep 8:  By analyzing these relations, we can determine the prime factorization of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$.\nStep 9:  We find that $a=2^3\\cdot 3^3\\cdot 5^3\\cdot w$, $b=2^3\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 5^3\\cdot x$, $c=2^2\\cdot 3^3\\cdot 5^2\\cdot y$, and $d=2^2\\cdot 3^3\\cdot 5^2\\cdot z$, where $w$, $x$, $y$, and $z$ are positive integers.\nStep 10:  We can then use the prime factorization of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ to find the gcd of these numbers.\nStep 11:  The gcd of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ is the product of the common prime factors raised to the lowest power. In this case, the common prime factors are $2^2$, $3^3$, and $5^2$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the gcd of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ is $2^2\\cdot 3^3\\cdot 5^2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1800}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of turns required to guarantee that at least one of the guessed squares is covered by the rectangle.\nStep 2:  We can start by considering the worst-case scenario, where the rectangle covers two adjacent squares in a way that maximizes the number of turns needed to find at least one covered square.\nStep 3:  If the rectangle covers the top-left and top-center squares, then the top-right square is not covered. Similarly, if the rectangle covers the top-left and top-right squares, then the top-center square is not covered. This means that if the rectangle covers the top-left and top-center squares, we need to guess the top-right square to be sure that at least one of the squares is covered.\nStep 4:  In the worst-case scenario, we need to guess the top-right square, and then we can be sure that at least one of the squares is covered.
