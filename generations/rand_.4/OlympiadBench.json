  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the conditions given and how they relate to determining the number Xenia thought of.\nStep 2:  Xenia thinks of a positive integer $N$ not exceeding 5000 and fixes 20 distinct positive integers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{20}$ such that, for each $k=1,2, \\ldots, 20$, the numbers $N$ and $a_{k}$ are congruent modulo $k$.\nStep 3:  This means that for each $k$, $N \\equiv a_k \\pmod{k}$, which implies that $a_k$ is the remainder when $N$ is divided by $k$.\nStep 4:  Sergey's goal is to determine the number $N$ by asking a set $S$ of positive integers not exceeding 20, and Xenia will respond with the set $\\left\\{a_{k}: k \\in S\\right\\}$ without revealing which number corresponds to which index.\nStep 5:  We need to find the minimum number of moves Sergey needs to make to determine the number $N$ for sure.\nStep 6:  To approach this, we can consider the information that can be obtained from each move and how it helps in narrowing down the possible values of $N$.\nStep 7:  We can start by analyzing the information obtained from the first move and then proceed to subsequent moves, considering the constraints and the information gained from each move.\nStep 8:  By analyzing the information obtained from each move, we can determine the minimum number of moves required to uniquely determine the number $N$.\nStep 9:  This will involve considering the constraints and the information gained from each move, and using logical deductions to narrow down the possible values of $N$.\nStep 10:  By following this approach, we can determine the minimum number of moves Sergey needs to make to determine the number $N$ for sure.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{19}$",

  "## Step 1: Understand the problem statement\nThe problem asks us to find all positive integers $n$ such that for any monic polynomial $P$ of degree at most $n$ with integer coefficients, there exists a positive integer $k \\leq n$ and $k+1$ distinct integers $x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_{k+1}$ satisfying the equation $P(x_1) + P(x_2) + \\cdots + P(x_k) = P(x_{k+1})$.\n\n## Step 2: Consider the properties of monic polynomials\nA monic polynomial is a polynomial with the leading coefficient equal to 1. This means that the polynomial can be written in the form $P(x) = x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_1x + a_0$, where $a_i$ are integers.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the given equation\nThe equation $P(x_1) + P(x_2) + \\cdots + P(x_k) = P(x_{k+1})$ suggests that the sum of the values of the polynomial at $k$ distinct points is equal to the value of the polynomial at another distinct point.\n\n## Step 4: Consider the degree of the polynomial\nSince the polynomial is of degree at most $n$, we can consider the possible values of $n$ that satisfy the given condition.\n\n## Step 5: Use the properties of polynomials to derive a condition for n\nWe can use the fact that a polynomial of degree $n$ has at most $n$ distinct roots. This means that if we have a polynomial of degree $n$, we can find at most $n$ distinct values of $x$ that satisfy the equation $P(x) = 0$.\n\n## Step 6: Derive a condition for n using the given equation\nUsing the given equation, we can see that if we have a polynomial of degree $n$, we can find at most $n$ distinct values of $x$ that satisfy the equation $P(x_1) + P(x_2) + \\cdots + P(x_k) = P(x_{k+1})$. This means that $k+1 \\leq n$.\n\n## Step 7: Consider the case when k = n\nIf $k = n$, then we have $n+1$ distinct values of $x$ that satisfy the equation $P(x_1) + P(x_2) + \\cdots + P(x_n) = P(x_{n+1})$. This means that the polynomial $P(x)$ must have at least $n+1$ distinct roots.\n\n## Step 8: Derive a condition for n using the properties of polynomials\nSince a polynomial of degree $n$ has at most $n$ distinct roots, we can conclude that $n+1 > n$. This is a contradiction, so we must have $n+1 \\leq n$.\n\n## Step 9: Solve the inequality n+1 \u2264 n\nThe inequality $n+1 \\leq n$ is equivalent to $1 \\leq 0$. This is a contradiction, so we must have $n = 1$.\n\n## Step 10: Verify the solution\nWe can verify that $n = 1$ satisfies the given condition. For any monic polynomial $P$ of degree at most 1 with integer coefficients, we can find two distinct integers $x_1$ and $x_2$ such that $P(x_1) + P(x_2) = P(x_3)$ for some $x_3$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

This results in a configuration of $n$ arrows.\nStep 3:  We can approach this problem by considering the possible arrangements of the arrows and then counting the number of good configurations.\nStep 4:  First, we note that if we have a good configuration, we can rotate it to make the arrow pointing to the right of the top point point upwards. This is a valid operation because it doesn't change the configuration.\nStep 5:  Now, we consider the possible positions of the arrow pointing upwards. We can place it in any of the $n$ positions, and then we have $n-1$ choices for the position of the next arrow, $n-2$ choices for the next one, and so on, until we have only one choice for the last arrow.\nStep 6:  This gives us a total of $n(n-1)(n-2) \\cdots 2 \\cdot 1 = n!$ possible configurations.\nStep 7:  However, we need to consider the cases where the configuration is not good.

  "## Step 1: Understand the constraints of the problem\nWe have a 100x100 chessboard and need to place 2500 chess kings on it. The constraints are that no two kings can be placed in squares sharing a common vertex, and each row and each column must contain exactly 25 kings.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the pattern of king placement\nTo satisfy the constraints, the kings must be placed in a way that they are not adjacent to each other. This means that each king must be placed in a square that is not adjacent to any other king. Given the constraints, the only possible arrangement is to place the kings in a checkerboard pattern.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to place the kings in the first row\nSince each row must contain exactly 25 kings, we can choose 25 squares out of the 100 squares in the first row to place the kings. This can be done in $\\binom{100}{25}$ ways.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to place the kings in the remaining rows\nOnce the kings are placed in the first row, the remaining rows must also contain exactly 25 kings. Since the kings are placed in a checkerboard pattern, the kings in the remaining rows are determined by the placement in the first row. Therefore, there is only one way to place the kings in the remaining rows.\n\n## Step 5: Account for the rotational and reflection symmetries\nSince the problem considers two arrangements to be different if they differ by rotation or reflection, we need to divide the total number of arrangements by the number of possible rotations and reflections. There are 8 possible rotations (including the identity rotation) and 8 possible reflections, resulting in a total of 16 symmetries.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total number of arrangements\nThe total number of arrangements is the number of ways to place the kings in the first row, divided by the number of symmetries. This gives us $\\frac{\\binom{100}{25}}{16}$.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the expression\nWe can simplify the expression by calculating the value of $\\binom{100}{25}$ and then dividing it by 16.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the value of $\\binom{100}{25}$\nUsing the formula for combinations, we can calculate the value of $\\binom{100}{25}$.\n\n## Step 9: Divide the value of $\\binom{100}{25}$ by 16\nAfter calculating the value of $\\binom{100}{25}$, we can divide it by 16 to get the final answer.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate the final answer\n$\\binom{100}{25} = 159527040$, and dividing this by 16 gives us the final answer.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{9970650}$",

  "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of a regular 2006-gon and the conditions for a triangle to be isosceles with two odd sides.\n## Step 2:  First, we note that a regular 2006-gon has 2006 vertices, and a diagonal of the 2006-gon is called odd if its endpoints divide the boundary into two parts, each composed of an odd number of sides.\n## Step 3:  We are tasked with finding the maximum possible number of isosceles triangles with two odd sides when the 2006-gon is dissected into triangles by 2003 nonintersecting diagonals.\n## Step 4:  Let's consider the properties of an isosceles triangle with two odd sides. We can label the vertices of the triangle as A, B, and C, where AB and AC are the odd sides.\n## Step 5:  Since AB and AC are odd sides, the number of sides between A and B, and between A and C, must be odd. This implies that the number of sides between B and C must also be odd.\n## Step 6:  Therefore, the triangle must be isosceles with two odd sides if and only if the number of sides between B and C is odd.\n## Step 7:  Now, let's consider the total number of triangles that can be formed with the given 2003 nonintersecting diagonals. We can use the fact that the number of triangles formed by a set of nonintersecting diagonals is equal to the number of diagonals plus one.\n## Step 8:  This gives us a total of 2004 triangles. However, we need to find the maximum possible number of isosceles triangles with two odd sides.\n## Step 9:  To maximize the number of isosceles triangles, we need to minimize the number of triangles with two even sides. This can be achieved by maximizing the number of triangles with one odd side and one even side.\n## Step 10:  We can do this by choosing the 2003 nonintersecting diagonals such that they form a set of triangles with one odd side and one even side.\n## Step 11:  This can be visualized as a set of triangles with one odd side and one even side, where each triangle has one vertex connected to the center of the 2006-gon.\n## Step 12:  By choosing the diagonals in this way, we can maximize the number of isosceles triangles with two odd sides.\n## Step 13:  Therefore, the maximum possible number of isosceles triangles with two odd sides is equal to the number of triangles with one odd side and one even side, which is 1003.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1003}$",

  "## Step 1: Understand the problem and the conditions given\nWe are given that Gugu writes down three lines of real numbers on the blackboard. The first line consists of numbers of the form $a-b$, where $a$ and $b$ are two numbers on his napkin. The second line consists of numbers of the form $qab$, where $a$ and $b$ are two numbers from the first line. The third line consists of numbers of the form $a^2+b^2-c^2-d^2$, where $a, b, c, d$ are four numbers from the first line. We need to find all values of $q$ such that every number in the second line is also a number in the third line, regardless of the numbers on Gugu's napkin.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the relationship between the numbers in the first and second lines\nLet's consider the numbers in the first line, which are of the form $a-b$. We can rewrite this as $a-b = (a^2 + b^2) - (c^2 + d^2)$, where $c$ and $d$ are also numbers from the first line. This suggests that the numbers in the second line are of the form $qab$, and we need to find a relationship between $qab$ and $(a^2 + b^2) - (c^2 + d^2)$.\n\n## Step 3: Derive the relationship between $qab$ and $(a^2 + b^2) - (c^2 + d^2)$\nWe can rewrite the expression $(a^2 + b^2) - (c^2 + d^2)$ as $(a^2 - c^2) + (b^2 - d^2)$. This suggests that the numbers in the second line are of the form $qab$, and we need to find a relationship between $qab$ and $(a^2 - c^2) + (b^2 - d^2)$.\n\n## Step 4: Use the difference of squares identity to simplify the expression\nWe can use the difference of squares identity to simplify the expression $(a^2 - c^2) + (b^2 - d^2)$. This identity states that $a^2 - c^2 = (a+c)(a-c)$ and $b^2 - d^2 = (b+d)(b-d)$. Therefore, we can rewrite the expression as $(a+c)(a-c) + (b+d)(b-d)$.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze the relationship between $qab$ and $(a+c)(a-c) + (b+d)(b-d)$\nWe can see that the expression $(a+c)(a-c) + (b+d)(b-d)$ is a sum of two products. We can rewrite this as $(a+c)(a-c) + (b+d)(b-d) = (a+c)(a-c) + (b+d)(b-d) + 0$. This suggests that the numbers in the second line are of the form $qab$, and we need to find a relationship between $qab$ and $(a+c)(a-c) + (b+d)(b-d) + 0$.\n\n## Step 6: Use the distributive property to simplify the expression\nWe can use the distributive property to simplify the expression $(a+c)(a-c) + (b+d)(b-d) + 0$. This property states that $a(b+c) = ab + ac$. Therefore, we can rewrite the expression as $(a+c)(a-c) + (b+d)(b-d) + 0 = a(a-c) + c(a-c) + b(b-d) + d(b-d) + 0$.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze the relationship between $qab$ and $a(a-c) + c(a-c) + b(b-d) + d(b-d) + 0$\nWe can see that the expression $a(a-c) + c(a-c) + b(b-d) + d(b-d) + 0$ is a sum of four terms.

We can rewrite this as $(a^2 - c^2) + (b^2 - d^2) + 0 + 0 = (a^2 - c^2) + (b^2 - d^2) + 0 + 0 = (a^2 - c^2) + (b^2 - d^2)$. This suggests that the numbers in the second line are of the form $qab$, and we need to find a relationship between $qab$ and $(a^2 - c^2) + (b^2 - d^2)$.\n\n## Step 12: Use the distributive property to simplify the expression\nWe can use the distributive property to simplify the expression $(a^2 - c^2) + (b^2 - d^2)$.

In this scenario, we have $3 \\cdot 2^2 = 12$ unit cubes, and we can paint them with $3$ different colors.

  "## Step 1: Understand the constraints of the problem\nThe problem requires finding all positive integers $n$ for which all positive divisors of $n$ can be arranged in a rectangular table under specific constraints. Each cell must contain a distinct divisor, the sums of all rows must be equal, and the sums of all columns must be equal.\n\n## Step 2: Consider the properties of divisors\nTo tackle this problem, we need to consider the properties of divisors. The divisors of a number $n$ include $1$ and $n$ itself. If $n$ is a prime number, its only divisors are $1$ and $n$. If $n$ is a composite number, it has more divisors.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the case when $n$ is a prime number\nWhen $n$ is a prime number, the only divisors are $1$ and $n$. In this case, it is impossible to arrange the divisors in a rectangular table where the sums of all rows and columns are equal, as the sum of the first row (containing $1$) would be $1$, and the sum of the second row (containing $n$) would be $n$, which cannot be equal.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the case when $n$ is a composite number\nWhen $n$ is a composite number, it has more divisors. We need to consider the possible arrangements of these divisors in a rectangular table.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the number of divisors of $n$\nLet's denote the number of divisors of $n$ as $d(n)$. If $d(n)$ is odd, then $n$ must be a perfect square, as the product of an odd number of divisors must be a perfect square.\n\n## Step 6: Consider the case when $n$ is a perfect square\nWhen $n$ is a perfect square, we can arrange the divisors in a square table. However, this does not guarantee that the sums of all rows and columns are equal.\n\n## Step 7: Consider the case when $n$ is not a perfect square\nWhen $n$ is not a perfect square, we need to consider the possible arrangements of the divisors in a rectangular table.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze the constraints for the rectangular table\nThe constraints for the rectangular table are that each cell contains a distinct divisor, the sums of all rows are equal, and the sums of all columns are equal. We need to find a way to satisfy these constraints.\n\n## Step 9: Consider the relationship between the number of divisors and the dimensions of the table\nLet's denote the number of rows as $r$ and the number of columns as $c$. We know that the total number of divisors is $rc$. We also know that the sum of all divisors is $n + d(n) - 1$, where $d(n)$ is the number of divisors.\n\n## Step 10: Derive the relationship between the number of rows, columns, and the number of divisors\nWe can derive the relationship between the number of rows, columns, and the number of divisors by considering the sum of all rows and columns.\n\n## Step 11: Solve for the number of rows and columns\nUsing the derived relationship, we can solve for the number of rows and columns.\n\n## Step 12: Find the possible values of $n$\nUsing the relationship between the number of rows, columns, and the number of divisors, we can find the possible values of $n$.\n\n## Step 13: Verify the possible values of $n$\nWe need to verify that the possible values of $n$ satisfy the constraints of the problem.\n\n## Step 14: List the possible values of $n$\nAfter verifying the possible values of $n$, we can list them.\n\n## Step 15: Provide the final answer\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{146}$",
  "Step 1:  To find the smallest positive integer $k$ that allows for a unique partition of a $2n \\times 2n$ board into $1 \\times 2$ and $2 \\times 1$ dominoes, we need to consider the properties of such a partition.\nStep 2:  First, we note that the total number of cells in the $2n \\times 2n$ board is $(2n)^2 = 4n^2$.\nStep 3:  Since each domino covers two cells, the total number of dominoes in the partition must be half the total number of cells, which is $2n^2$.\nStep 4:  We also observe that each domino must contain one marked cell and one unmarked cell. This means that the number of marked cells must be equal to the number of unmarked cells.\nStep 5:  Therefore, the number of marked cells, denoted as $k$, must be equal to half the total number of dominoes, which is $2n^2$.\nStep 6:  However, we need to find the smallest positive integer $k$ that satisfies this condition.\nStep 7:  To do this, we consider the parity of $n$. If $n$ is even, then $2n^2$ is even, and we can choose $k = 2n^2$.\nStep 8:  On the other hand, if $n$ is odd, then $2n^2$ is even, and we can choose $k = 2n^2 - 1$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the smallest positive integer $k$ that satisfies the given condition is $2n^2 - 1$ when $n$ is odd, and $2n^2$ when $n$ is even.\nStep 10:  However, we need to find the smallest positive integer $k$ that works for all $n$, not just specific values of $n$.\nStep 11:  To find the smallest such $k$, we need to consider the smallest possible value of $n$ and the corresponding value of $k$.\nStep 12:  Since $n$ is a positive integer, the smallest possible value of $n$ is $1$.\nStep 13:  When $n = 1$, the value of $k$ is $2(1)^2 - 1 = 1$.\nStep 14:  Therefore, the smallest positive integer $k$ that satisfies the given condition is $\\boxed{1}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

To do this, we can start by considering the smallest possible sums of elements from $A_n$ and work our way up to find the largest such integer.\nStep 5:  We can start by considering the sum of the smallest element, which is $0$, and then consider the sum of the next smallest element, which is $2^n - 2^1 = 2^{n-1}$. We can continue this process to find the largest positive integer that cannot be written as the sum of one or more elements of $A_n$.\nStep 6:  By analyzing the possible sums of elements from $A_n$, we can determine the largest positive integer that cannot be expressed in this form.\nStep 7:  We can then use this information to find the largest positive integer that cannot be written as the sum of one or more elements of $A_n$.\nStep 8:  By following this process, we can determine the largest positive integer that satisfies the given condition.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$",

To show this, we need to find a set of $3$ distinct real numbers such that each of its elements can be written as a sum of $2$ other distinct elements of the set.\nStep 5:  We can take the set $\\{1, 2, 3\\}$.

However, the lumberjack can decrease the height of at most 4 trees in each turn.

Therefore, the gardener can ensure that at most $28304$ trees become majestic, regardless of the lumberjack's moves.\n\n## Step 8: Determine the largest number K\nThe largest number $K$ such that the gardener can ensure there are eventually $K$ majestic trees on the board is $28304$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2022}$",

A knight can move in an L-shape, two squares in one direction and then one square to the side, or one square in one direction and then two squares to the side. This means that a knight can attack squares that are two squares away horizontally and one square away vertically, or one square away horizontally and two squares away vertically.\nStep 3:  Now, let's consider the movement of a queen. A queen can move any number of squares in any direction - horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. This means that a queen can attack any square on the same row, column, or diagonal as the queen.\nStep 4:  Given this information, we need to find the maximal positive $K$ such that, regardless of the strategy of Queenie, Horst can put at least $K$ knights on the board.\nStep 5:  To do this, we can consider the worst-case scenario for Horst.

We need to find the value of $f(9)-f(3)$, given that $f(3): f(6)=1: 3$.\nStep 2:  The given ratio $f(3): f(6)=1: 3$ can be expressed as $\\frac{f(3)}{f(6)}=\\frac{1}{3}$.\nStep 3:  Substituting the function $f(x)$ into the ratio, we get $\\frac{2^{3k}+9}{2^{6k}+9}=\\frac{1}{3}$.\nStep 4:  Cross-multiplying, we obtain $3(2^{3k}+9)=2^{6k}+9$.\nStep 5:  Simplifying this equation, we get $3\\cdot 2^{3k}+27=2^{6k}+9$.\nStep 6:  Rearranging the terms, we have $2^{6k}-3\\cdot 2^{3k}+18=0$.\nStep 7:  Let's define $x=2^{3k}$, so we can rewrite the equation as $x^2-3x+18=0$.\nStep 8:  This is a quadratic equation in terms of $x$, and we can solve for $x$ using the quadratic formula.\nStep 9:  The quadratic formula states that for an equation of the form $ax^2+bx+c=0$, the solutions are given by $x=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$.\nStep 10:  Applying this formula to our equation, we get $x=\\frac{-(-3)\\pm\\sqrt{(-3)^2-4(1)(18)}}{2(1)}$.\nStep 11:  Simplifying further, we have $x=\\frac{3\\pm\\sqrt{9-72}}{2}$.\nStep 12:  This gives us $x=\\frac{3\\pm\\sqrt{-63}}{2}$.\nStep 13:  Since $k$ is a real number, the value of $x=2^{3k}$ must be real as well. However, the expression $\\sqrt{-63}$ involves the square root of a negative number, which means $x$ cannot be real.\nStep 14:  Therefore, we must have $x=2^{3k}=9$, as this is the only real solution to the quadratic equation.\nStep 15:  Substituting $x=9$ back into the equation $x=2^{3k}$, we get $2^{3k}=9$.\nStep 16:  This implies that $k=\\frac{\\log_2 9}{3}$.\nStep 17:  Now, we need to find the value of $f(9)-f(3)$ using the function $f(x)=2^{k x}+9$.\nStep 18:  Substituting $x=9$ and $x=3$ into the function, we get $f(9)=2^{3k\\cdot 9}+9$ and $f(3)=2^{3k\\cdot 3}+9$.\nStep 19:  Therefore, $f(9)-f(3)=2^{27k}+9-(2^{9k}+9)$.\nStep 20:  Simplifying this expression, we have $f(9)-f(3)=2^{27k}-2^{9k}$.\nStep 21:  Substituting the value of $k=\\frac{\\log_2 9}{3}$, we get $f(9)-f(3)=2^{27\\cdot \\frac{\\log_2 9}{3}}-2^{9\\cdot \\frac{\\log_2 9}{3}}$.\nStep 22:  This simplifies to $f(9)-f(3)=2^{9\\log_2 9}-2^{3\\log_2 9}$.\nStep 23:  Using the property of logarithms that $a^{\\log_a b}=b$, we can rewrite this as $f(9)-f(3)=(9^9)-3^9$.\nStep 24:  Therefore, the value of $f(9)-f(3)$ is $\\boxed{387420489}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{387420489}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the speed of the current, Serge's paddling speed, and the time it takes him to travel from point $A$ to point $B$.\nStep 2:  Let's denote Serge's paddling speed as $p$ and the speed of the current as $c$. When Serge paddles with the current, his effective speed is $p + c$, and when he paddles against the current, his effective speed is $p - c$.\nStep 3:  We are given that it takes Serge 18 minutes to paddle with the current from $A$ to $B$, and 30 minutes to paddle against the current from $A$ to $B$.\nStep 4:  We can use the formula $d = rt$ to relate the distance, speed, and time.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first understand the given scenario. We have a square $O P Q R$ with vertices at $O(0,0), P(0,8), Q(8,8)$, and $R(8,0)$. There's a parabola with the equation $y=a(x-2)(x-6)$ that intersects the sides of the square at points $K, L, M$, and $N$.\nStep 2:  We are asked to find all the values of $a$ for which the area of the trapezoid $K L M N$ is 36.\nStep 3:  To start, we need to find the coordinates of the points of intersection, $K, L, M$, and $N$. We can do this by substituting the $x$-coordinates of the sides of the square into the equation of the parabola to find the corresponding $y$-coordinates.\nStep 4:  For the side $OP$, the $x$-coordinate is 0, so we substitute $x=0$ into the equation of the parabola to get $y=a(0-2)(0-6) = 12a$. This gives us the coordinates of $K$ as $(0,12a)$.\nStep 5:  Similarly, for the side $OQ$, the $x$-coordinate is 8, so we substitute $x=8$ into the equation of the parabola to get $y=a(8-2)(8-6) = 24a$. This gives us the coordinates of $L$ as $(8,24a)$.\nStep 6:  For the side $QR$, the $x$-coordinate is 8, so we substitute $x=8$ into the equation of the parabola to get $y=a(8-2)(8-6) = 24a$. This gives us the coordinates of $M$ as $(8,24a)$.\nStep 7:  For the side $RP$, the $x$-coordinate is 0, so we substitute $x=0$ into the equation of the parabola to get $y=a(0-2)(0-6) = 12a$. This gives us the coordinates of $N$ as $(0,12a)$.\nStep 8:  Now that we have the coordinates of the points of intersection, we can use the formula for the area of a trapezoid to find the area of $K L M N$ in terms of $a$.\nStep 9:  The formula for the area of a trapezoid is $\\frac{1}{2}h(b_1+b_2)$, where $h$ is the height and $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the lengths of the two bases.\nStep 10:  In this case, the height of the trapezoid is the difference between the $y$-coordinates of $L$ and $K$, which is $24a-12a=12a$. The lengths of the two bases are the differences between the $x$-coordinates of $L$ and $K$, and the $x$-coordinates of $M$ and $N$, which are both 8.\nStep 11:  Substituting these values into the formula for the area of a trapezoid, we get $\\frac{1}{2}(12a)(8+8)=72a$.\nStep 12:  We are given that the area of the trapezoid is 36, so we can set up the equation $72a=36$ and solve for $a$.\nStep 13:  Dividing both sides of the equation by 72, we get $a=\\frac{36}{72}=\\frac{1}{2}$.\nStep 14:  Therefore, the value of $a$ for which the area of the trapezoid $K L M N$ is 36 is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$",

Since the probability of living at least 15 more years is less than the probability of living at least 10 more years, we can conclude that the probability of living at least 5 more years is greater than $25 \\%$.\nStep 12:  However, we also know that the probability of living at least 15 more years is less than the probability of living at least 10 more years, which means that the probability of living at least 5 more years is less than $50 \\%$.\nStep 13:  Therefore, the probability that an 80-year-old person will live at least another 5 years is between $25 \\%$ and $50 \\%$.\nStep 14:  We can use the fact that the probability of living at least 5 more years is less than the probability of living at least 10 more years to find the exact probability.\nStep 15:  Since the probability of living at least 10 more years is $25 \\%$, and the probability of living at least 15 more years is $20 \\%$, we can conclude that the probability of living at least 5 more years is $30 \\%$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{30}$",

In this case, the common ratio is $r$.\nStep 3:  An arithmetic sequence, on the other hand, is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is obtained from the previous term by adding a constant. This constant is called the common difference.\nStep 4:  Given the geometric sequence 4, $4r$, $4r^2$, we need to find the values of $r$ for which this sequence is also an arithmetic sequence.\nStep 5:  For the sequence to be arithmetic, the difference between consecutive terms must be constant.

Since $t_{3}=5$ and $t_{n-2}=95$, we can use the formula for the $k$th term of an arithmetic sequence, which is given by $t_k = a_1 + (k-1)d$, where $a_1$ is the first term and $d$ is the common difference.\nStep 7:  We can use this formula to find the common difference $d$ by setting up the equation $t_{n-2} = t_3 + (n-5)d$ and solving for $d$.\nStep 8:  Once we have the common difference, we can use it to find the value of $n$ by using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence.\nStep 9:  We can then solve for $n$ by plugging in the values we know and solving the resulting equation.\nStep 10:  By following these steps, we can find the value of $n$ that satisfies the given conditions.\n\nStep 11:  First, let's find the common difference $d$ using the formula $t_{n-2} = t_3 + (n-5)d$.\nStep 12:  We have $t_{n-2} = 95$ and $t_3 = 5$, so we can plug these values into the formula to get $95 = 5 + (n-5)d$.\nStep 13:  Simplifying this equation, we get $90 = (n-5)d$.\nStep 14:  Now, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence to find the value of $n$.\nStep 15:  The sum of the first $n$ terms is given by $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$, where $a_1$ is the first term and $a_n$ is the last term.\nStep 16:  We know that the sum of all $n$ terms is 1000, so we can set up the equation $\\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n) = 1000$.\nStep 17:  We can also use the formula for the $k$th term of an arithmetic sequence to find the value of $a_n$.\nStep 18:  The $k$th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by $t_k = a_1 + (k-1)d$, where $a_1$ is the first term and $d$ is the common difference.\nStep 19:  We can use this formula to find the value of $a_n$ by plugging in the values we know.\nStep 20:  Once we have the value of $a_n$, we can plug it into the equation $\\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n) = 1000$ and solve for $n$.\n\nStep 21:  Now, let's find the value of $a_n$ using the formula $t_k = a_1 + (k-1)d$.\nStep 22:  We have $t_n = a_n$ and $t_3 = 5$, so we can plug these values into the formula to get $t_n = 5 + (n-3)d$.\nStep 23:  Simplifying this equation, we get $t_n = 5 + (n-3)d$.\nStep 24:  Now, we can use the fact that $t_{n-2} = 95$ to find the value of $d$.\nStep 25:  We have $t_{n-2} = 95$ and $t_3 = 5$, so we can plug these values into the formula to get $95 = 5 + (n-5)d$.\nStep 26:  Simplifying this equation, we get $90 = (n-5)d$.\nStep 27:  Now, we can use the fact that $t_n = 5 + (n-3)d$ to find the value of $a_n$.\nStep 28:  We have $t_n = a_n$ and $t_3 = 5$, so we can plug these values into the formula to get $a_n = 5 + (n-3)d$.\nStep 29:  Simplifying this equation, we get $a_n = 5 + (n-3)d$.\nStep 30:  Now, we can plug the value of $a_n$ into the equation $\\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n) = 1000$ and solve for $n$.\n\nStep 31:  Plugging in the value of $a_n$, we get $\\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + 5 + (n-3)d) = 1000$.\nStep 32:  Simplifying this equation, we get $\\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + 5 + (n-3)d) = 1000$.\nStep 33:  Now, we can use the fact that $90 = (n-5)d$ to substitute for $d$ in the equation.\nStep 34:  We have $90 = (n-5)d$, so we can plug this value into the equation to get $\\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + 5 + (n-3)\\frac{90}{n-5}) = 1000$.\nStep 35:  Simplifying this equation, we get $\\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + 5 + \\frac{270}{n-5}) = 1000$.\nStep 36:  Now, we can use the fact that $t_{n-2} = 95$ to find the value of $a_1$.\nStep 37:  We have $t_{n-2} = 95$ and $t_3 = 5$, so we can plug these values into the formula to get $95 = a_1 + (n-5)d$.\nStep 38:  Simplifying this equation, we get $95 = a_1 + (n-5)d$.\nStep 39:  Now, we can use the fact that $90 = (n-5)d$ to substitute for $d$ in the equation.\nStep 40:  We have $90 = (n-5)d$, so we can plug this value into the equation to get $95 = a_1 + (n-5)\\frac{90}{n-5}$.\nStep 41:  Simplifying this equation, we get $95 = a_1 + 90$.\nStep 42:  Now, we can solve for $a_1$ by subtracting 90 from both sides of the equation.\nStep 43:  We get $a_1 = 5$.\nStep 44:  Now, we can plug the value of $a_1$ into the equation $\\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + 5 + \\frac{270}{n-5}) = 1000$ and solve for $n$.\n\nStep 45:  Plugging in the value of $a_1$, we get $\\frac{n}{2}(5 + 5 + \\frac{270}{n-5}) = 1000$.\nStep 46:  Simplifying this equation, we get $\\frac{n}{2}(10 + \\frac{270}{n-5}) = 1000$.\nStep 47:  Now, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction.\nStep 48:  We get $n(10 + \\frac{270}{n-5}) = 2000$.\nStep 49:  Now, we can distribute the $n$ to the terms inside the parentheses.\nStep 50:  We get $10n + \\frac{270n}{n-5} = 2000$.\nStep 51:  Now, we can multiply both sides of the equation by $n-5$ to eliminate the fraction.\nStep 52:  We get $10n(n-5) + 270n = 2000(n-5)$.\nStep 53:  Now, we can expand the left-hand side of",

This results in a total of $(10 \\times 75) \\times(15 \\times 75)=843750$ pixels.\nStep 3:  Now, if each of the dimensions is increased by $n \\%$ and the resolution is decreased by $n \\%$, we need to find the new dimensions and resolution in terms of $n$.\nStep 4:  Increasing each dimension by $n \\%$ means multiplying the original dimensions by $(1+\\frac{n}{100})$. Therefore, the new dimensions are $10(1+\\frac{n}{100})$ and $15(1+\\frac{n}{100})$.\nStep 5:  Decreasing the resolution by $n \\%$ means multiplying the original resolution by $(1-\\frac{n}{100})$.

In this case, $a = k$, $b = 6$, and $c = k$.\nStep 3:  For the parabola to have two distinct $x$-intercepts, the discriminant must be positive, i.e., $b^2 - 4ac > 0$.\nStep 4:  Substituting the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ into the discriminant expression, we get $6^2 - 4(k)(k) > 0$.\nStep 5:  Simplifying this inequality, we have $36 - 4k^2 > 0$.\nStep 6:  Rearranging the terms, we get $4k^2 < 36$.\nStep 7:  Dividing both sides by $4$, we obtain $k^2 < 9$.\nStep 8:  Taking the square root of both sides, we get $|k| < 3$.\nStep 9:  This means that the values of $k$ must satisfy the inequality $-3 < k < 3$.\nStep 10:  However, we are asked to find all integers $k$, with $k \\neq 0$, for which the parabola has two distinct $x$-intercepts.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the possible values of $k$ are the integers between $-3$ and $3$, excluding $0$.\nStep 12:  The integers satisfying this condition are $-2$, $-1$, $1$, and $2$.\nStep 13:  Hence, the final answer is the set of these integers.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\{-2,-1,1,2\\}}",

This equation implies that either $x-1=0$ or $y-2=0$.

We can substitute the values obtained from the first two equations into this equation to find the corresponding values of $y$ and $z$.\nStep 5:  If $x=1$, then from the first equation, we have $y=2$. Substituting these values into the third equation gives us $1+2z=9$, which simplifies to $z=4$. Therefore, one solution is $(x,y,z)=(1,2,4)$.\nStep 6:  If $x=3$, then from the second equation, we have $z=-2$. Substituting these values into the third equation gives us $3+(-2)y=9$, which simplifies to $y=-3$. Therefore, another solution is $(x,y,z)=(3,-3,-2)$.\nStep 7:  By considering all possible combinations of values from the first two equations and substituting them into the third equation, we have found the two solutions to the system of equations.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the solutions to the system of equations are $(x,y,z)=(1,2,4)$ and $(x,y,z)=(3,-3,-2)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",

Let's denote this as $x$ for bottle A, $y$ for bottle B, and $z$ for bottle C.\nStep 7:  We know that the total mass of the new mixture is $60 \\mathrm{~g}$, so we have the equation $x + y + z = 60$.\nStep 8:  We also know that the amount of acid in the new mixture is $15 \\mathrm{~g}$, so we have the equation $0.1 x + 0.2 y + 0.3 z = 15$.\nStep 9:  We can solve this system of equations to find the values of $x$, $y$, and $z$.\nStep 10:  Once we have the values of $x$, $y$, and $z$, we can find the amount of acid in the remaining contents of each bottle by subtracting the amount used from the total amount in each bottle.\nStep 11:  Finally, we can find the total amount of acid in the new mixture by adding the amounts of acid from the remaining contents of each bottle.\nStep 12:  We can then calculate the percentage of acid in the new mixture by dividing the total amount of acid by the total mass of the new mixture and multiplying by $100$.\n\n```python\n# Define the variables\nx = 0  # amount of mixture from bottle A used\ny = 0  # amount of mixture from bottle B used\nz = 0  # amount of mixture from bottle C used\n\n# Define the equations\neq1 = x + y + z - 60  # equation 1: x + y + z = 60\neq2 = 0.1 * x + 0.2 * y + 0.3 * z - 15  # equation 2: 0.1x + 0.2y + 0.3z = 15\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\nx, y, z = symbols('x y z')\neq1 = Eq(x + y + z, 60)\neq2 = Eq(0.1*x + 0.2*y + 0.3*z, 15)\n\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y, z))\n\n# Extract the values of x, y, and z from the solution\nx_val = solution[x]\ny_val = solution[y]\nz_val = solution[z]\n\n# Calculate the amount of acid in the remaining contents of each bottle\nacid_A = 40 - (x_val * 0.1)\nacid_B = 50 - (y_val * 0.2)\nacid_C = 50 - (z_val * 0.3)\n\n# Calculate the total amount of acid in the new mixture\ntotal_acid = acid_A + acid_B + acid_C\n\n# Calculate the percentage of acid in the new mixture\npercentage_acid = (total_acid / 60) * 100\n\nprint(f\"The final answer is \\boxed{{{percentage_acid}}}",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first understand the given information and what is being asked. We are told that there are 40 balls in a bag, and each ball is either black or gold. Feridun randomly removes two balls from the bag, and we are given that the probability of removing two gold balls is $\\frac{5}{12}$.\nStep 2:  Let's denote the number of gold balls as $g$. Since there are 40 balls in total, the number of black balls would be $40 - g$.\nStep 3:  The probability of drawing two gold balls can be calculated using combinations. The number of ways to choose 2 gold balls from $g$ gold balls is given by $\\binom{g}{2}$, and the total number of ways to choose 2 balls from 40 is $\\binom{40}{2}$.\nStep 4:  Therefore, the probability of drawing two gold balls is $\\frac{\\binom{g}{2}}{\\binom{40}{2}} = \\frac{5}{12}$.\nStep 5:  We can simplify this equation to $\\frac{g(g-1)}{2} \\cdot \\frac{2}{40 \\cdot 39} = \\frac{5}{12}$.\nStep 6:  Multiplying both sides by $40 \\cdot 39$ to clear the denominators, we get $g(g-1) = \\frac{5}{12} \\cdot 40 \\cdot 39 = 650$.\nStep 7:  This simplifies to the quadratic equation $g^2 - g - 650 = 0$.\nStep 8:  We can solve this quadratic equation by factoring it as $(g-25)(g+26) = 0$.\nStep 9:  This gives us two possible solutions: $g = 25$ or $g = -26$. However, since the number of gold balls cannot be negative, we discard the solution $g = -26$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the number of gold balls in the bag is $\\boxed{25}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{25}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of a geometric sequence and how to use the given information to find the value of $n$.\nStep 2:  We are given that the product of the first and last terms of the geometric sequence is $3$, and the product of all $n$ terms equals $59049$.\nStep 3:  Let's denote the first term of the sequence as $a$ and the common ratio as $r$. Then, the $n$th term of the sequence can be expressed as $ar^{n-1}$.\nStep 4:  We are given that $t_{1} t_{n}=3$, which translates to $a \\cdot ar^{n-1} = 3$. This simplifies to $a^2r^{n-1}=3$.\nStep 5:  Additionally, we know that the product of all $n$ terms equals $59049$, so we have $a \\cdot ar \\cdot ar^2 \\cdots ar^{n-1} = 59049$. This simplifies to $a^n r^{\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}} = 59049$.\nStep 6:  We can use these two equations to solve for $n$ by manipulating the expressions and using the properties of exponents.\nStep 7:  By dividing the second equation by the first, we get $\\frac{a^n r^{\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}}{a^2 r^{n-1}} = \\frac{59049}{3}$, which simplifies to $a^{n-2} r^{\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} - (n-1)} = 19683$.\nStep 8:  We can further simplify this expression to $a^{n-2} r^{\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} - n + 1} = 19683$.\nStep 9:  Now, we need to find the value of $n$ that satisfies this equation.\nStep 10:  We can start by trying different values of $n$ to see which one works.\nStep 11:  If we let $n=7$, we get $a^5 r^{10} = 19683$. We can then solve for $r$ by taking the fifth root of both sides, giving us $r^2 = 3$. This means that $r = \\sqrt{3}$.\nStep 12:  Substituting $r = \\sqrt{3}$ back into the equation $a^5 r^{10} = 19683$, we can solve for $a$.\nStep 13:  After finding the value of $a$, we can then use it to find the value of $n$.\nStep 14:  By following these steps, we can determine the value of $n$ that satisfies the given conditions.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$",

  "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are asked to find the number of positive integers with exactly $n$ digits and a sum of digits equal to 5, and then determine how many of these integers have a units digit of 1.\n\n## Step 2: Break down the problem\nTo tackle this problem, we need to consider the possible combinations of digits that sum up to 5 for each $n$. We can start by examining the possible combinations for small values of $n$ and look for patterns or relationships that can be generalized.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the possible combinations for small values of n\nFor $n=1$, there is only one possibility: the number 5 itself. For $n=2$, the possible combinations are 50, 41, 31, 22, 13, and 04, which sum up to 6, 5, 5, 5, 5, and 4, respectively. For $n=3$, the possible combinations are 5***, 4***, 3***, 2***, and 1***, where *** represents any digit from 0 to 9. We can see that the number of possibilities for each case is determined by the number of ways to choose the remaining digits to sum up to 5.\n\n## Step 4: Identify the pattern for the number of possibilities\nWe can observe that the number of possibilities for each case is determined by the number of ways to choose the remaining digits to sum up to 5. This can be represented by the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation $x_1 + x_2 + \\ldots + x_{n-1} = 5 - d$, where $d$ is the first digit of the number.\n\n## Step 5: Use the stars and bars method to count the number of possibilities\nUsing the stars and bars method, we can count the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation $x_1 + x_2 + \\ldots + x_{n-1} = 5 - d$. This can be represented by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{(5-d)+(n-2)-1}{(n-2)-1} = \\binom{5-d+n-2}{n-2}$.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the number of possibilities for each n\nWe can calculate the number of possibilities for each $n$ using the formula $\\binom{5-d+n-2}{n-2}$. For example, for $n=3$, we have $\\binom{5-d+1}{1} = \\binom{6-d}{1}$.\n\n## Step 7: Determine the number of integers with a units digit of 1\nWe need to determine how many of the integers $f(1), f(2), \\ldots, f(2014)$ have a units digit of 1. This can be done by counting the number of possibilities for each $n$ where the units digit is 1.\n\n## Step 8: Count the number of possibilities for each n where the units digit is 1\nFor each $n$, we need to count the number of possibilities where the units digit is 1.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to consider the different scenarios that can occur when the die is rolled and the changes that are made to the die based on the outcome of the roll.\nStep 2:  First, let's consider the probability of rolling an odd number on the first roll. The odd numbers on the die are 1, 3, and 4 is not odd, 6 is not odd, and 8 is not odd, so the odd numbers are 1, 3. There are 2 odd numbers out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability of rolling an odd number is $\\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\nStep 3:  If an odd number is rolled, all the odd numbers on the die are doubled. This means that the new odd numbers on the die will be 2, 6, and 16. The probability of rolling a 2 on the second roll, given that an odd number was rolled first, is $\\frac{1}{6}$.\nStep 4:  Now, let's consider the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll. The even numbers on the die are 2, 4, and 6, and 8. There are 4 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability of rolling an even number is $\\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}$.\nStep 5:  If an even number is rolled, all the even numbers on the die are halved. This means that the new even numbers on the die will be 1, 2, and 3, and 4. The probability of rolling a 2 on the second roll, given that an even number was rolled first, is $\\frac{1}{6}$.\nStep 6:  To find the overall probability of rolling a 2 on the second roll, we need to consider both scenarios and their respective probabilities. The probability of rolling a 2 on the second roll, given that an odd number was rolled first, is $\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{18}$. The probability of rolling a 2 on the second roll, given that an even number was rolled first, is $\\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{9}$.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the overall probability of rolling a 2 on the second roll is the sum of these two probabilities, which is $\\frac{1}{18} + \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{1}{18} + \\frac{2}{18} = \\frac{3}{18} = \\frac{1}{6}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the points awarded to each team and the formula for calculating the total points. We are given that the total points awarded are given by the formula: Points $=w \\times W+d \\times D+a \\times A+b \\times B$. We have to determine the values of $w, d, a$ and $b$.\nStep 2:  We can start by using the information from the table to set up a system of equations based on the formula for total points. We have seven teams, and for each team, we can write an equation using the given values of $W, D, A, B,$ and Points.\nStep 3:  The first team, Sussex, has 6 wins, 4 draws, 30 bonus bowling points, and 63 bonus batting points, with a total of 201 points. Using the formula, we get the equation $6w+4d+30a+63b=201$.\nStep 4:  Similarly, we can write equations for the other six teams using their respective values of $W, D, A, B,$ and Points.\nStep 5:  We then have a system of seven equations with four unknowns ($w, d, a,$ and $b$). We can solve this system of equations to find the values of $w, d, a,$ and $b$.\nStep 6:  To simplify the system of equations, we can subtract the equations from each other to eliminate some of the variables and make the system easier to solve.\nStep 7:  After simplifying the system of equations, we can solve for the values of $w, d, a,$ and $b$.\nStep 8:  Once we have the values of $w, d, a,$ and $b$, we can use them to calculate the total points awarded to each team using the formula: Points $=w \\times W+d \\times D+a \\times A+b \\times B$.\nStep 9:  By substituting the values of $w, d, a,$ and $b$ into the formula, we can verify that the total points awarded to each team match the given values in the table.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the values of $w, d, a,$ and $b$ that satisfy the given conditions are $w=8, d=8, a=0,$ and $b=5$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8,8,0,5}$",
  "Step 1:  We are given that $x$ is a positive number and that $x\\lfloor x\\rfloor=17$.\nStep 2:  The expression $\\lfloor x\\rfloor$ represents the greatest integer that is less than or equal to $x$. This means that $\\lfloor x\\rfloor$ is the integer part of $x$.\nStep 3:  We can start by considering the possible values of $\\lfloor x\\rfloor$. Since $x$ is positive, $\\lfloor x\\rfloor$ must also be positive.\nStep 4:  We know that $x\\lfloor x\\rfloor=17$, and since $x$ is positive, we can deduce that $\\lfloor x\\rfloor$ must be a factor of $17$.\nStep 5:  The factors of $17$ are $1$ and $17$ itself. However, since $x$ is positive, $\\lfloor x\\rfloor$ cannot be $1$ because then $x$ would be less than $2$, and $x\\lfloor x\\rfloor$ would be less than $2$ as well, which contradicts the given condition.\nStep 6:  Therefore, we conclude that $\\lfloor x\\rfloor=17$.\nStep 7:  Now, we can use the fact that $x\\lfloor x\\rfloor=17$ to find the value of $x$. We have $x\\lfloor x\\rfloor=17$, and since $\\lfloor x\\rfloor=17$, we can substitute this value into the equation to get $x\\cdot 17=17$.\nStep 8:  Solving for $x$, we find that $x=1$.\nStep 9:  However, we need to check if this value of $x$ satisfies the condition that $\\lfloor x\\rfloor=17$. Since $\\lfloor 1\\rfloor=1$, not $17$, this value of $x$ does not satisfy the condition.\nStep 10:  Therefore, we need to consider the next possible value of $\\lfloor x\\rfloor$, which is $4$. If $\\lfloor x\\rfloor=4$, then we have $x\\cdot 4=17$, which gives us $x=\\frac{17}{4}$.\nStep 11:  We can check if this value of $x$ satisfies the condition that $\\lfloor x\\rfloor=4$. Since $\\lfloor \\frac{17}{4}\\rfloor=4$, this value of $x$ does satisfy the condition.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the value of $x$ that satisfies the given conditions is $\\frac{17}{4}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{17}{4}}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the number of smaller cubes with no painted faces and the dimensions of the original cube.\nStep 2:  We are given that the cube has edges of length $n$, where $n$ is an integer. When the cube is cut into $n^{3}$ smaller cubes of unit length, we need to find the value of $n$ such that exactly 125 of these smaller cubes have no faces painted red.\nStep 3:  The number of smaller cubes with no faces painted red can be determined by considering the cubes that are not on the surface of the original cube. These cubes are located inside the cube and do not have any faces painted.\nStep 4:  The number of such cubes can be calculated by subtracting the number of cubes on the surface from the total number of cubes. The number of cubes on the surface can be found by considering the cubes on each face, edge, and corner of the original cube.\nStep 5:  The number of cubes on each face is $n^2$, and since there are 6 faces, the total number of cubes on the faces is $6n^2$. However, each edge cube is counted twice, so we need to subtract the number of edge cubes, which is $4n$. Similarly, each corner cube is counted three times, so we need to add back the number of corner cubes, which is $8$.\nStep 6:  Therefore, the number of cubes with at least one face painted is $6n^2 - 4n + 8$.\nStep 7:  The number of cubes with no faces painted is then $n^3 - (6n^2 - 4n + 8)$.\nStep 8:  We are given that this expression equals 125, so we have the equation $n^3 - (6n^2 - 4n + 8) = 125$.\nStep 9:  Simplifying this equation, we get $n^3 - 6n^2 + 4n - 133 = 0$.\nStep 10:  We can solve this cubic equation to find the value of $n$.\nStep 11:  By inspection, we find that $n = 5$ is a solution to the equation.\nStep 12:  To confirm that this is the only solution, we can perform polynomial division to factorize the cubic equation.\nStep 13:  Dividing $n^3 - 6n^2 + 4n - 133$ by $n - 5$, we get the quotient $n^2 - n - 26$.\nStep 14:  The quadratic equation $n^2 - n - 26$ can be factored as $(n - 7)(n + 4)$.\nStep 15:  Therefore, the cubic equation can be written as $(n - 5)(n - 7)(n + 4) = 0$.\nStep 16:  This means that the solutions to the equation are $n = 5, 7, -4$.\nStep 17:  However, since $n$ is an integer and represents the length of the edges of the cube, it must be positive.\nStep 18:  Therefore, the only valid solution is $n = \\boxed{5}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$",

This implies that both $g$ and $h$ must be integers.\nStep 5:  To find the values of $g$ and $h$, we can use the method of substitution or elimination to solve the system of equations.\nStep 6:  Let's start by solving the first equation for $g$: $g = \\frac{201 -

We can rewrite $\\log _{10}\\left(x^{4}\\right)$ as $4 \\log _{10} x$ using the power rule of logarithms.\nStep 3:  Substituting this into the equation gives us $4 \\log _{10} x=\\left(\\log _{10} x\\right)^{3}$.\nStep 4:  Let's introduce a new variable $a=\\log _{10} x$ to simplify the equation further. This transforms the equation into $4 a=a^{3}$.\nStep 5:  Rearranging the terms, we get $a^{3}-4 a=0$. Factoring out $a$, we have $a(a^{2}-4)=0$.\nStep 6:  This gives us two possible solutions: $a=0$ and $a^{2}-4=0$. Solving for $a$ in the second equation, we find $a=\\pm 2$.\nStep 7:  Substituting back $a=\\log _{10} x$, we get the solutions $\\log _{10} x=0$, $\\log _{10} x=2$, and $\\log _{10} x=-2$.\nStep 8:  Converting these back to exponential form, we find the corresponding values of $x$ as $x=1$, $x=10^{2}=100$, and $x=10^{-2}=0.01$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the points of intersection are $(1,0)$, $(100,4)$, and $(0.01,-2)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\left( 1, \\  0\\right),\\left( 100, \\  4\\right),\\left( 0.01, \\  -2\\right)}$",
  "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the process of Oi-Lam and George tossing coins and the conditions for George to toss exactly one head.\n## Step 2:  Oi-Lam tosses three fair coins, and we are interested in the scenarios where George gets to toss the coins that remain after Oi-Lam removes the heads.\n## Step 3:  We can break down the problem into cases based on the number of tails Oi-Lam gets when she tosses the coins.\n## Step 4:  Case 1: Oi-Lam gets 3 tails. In this case, George will get 3 tails, and there is no chance of him getting exactly one head.\n## Step 5:  Case 2: Oi-Lam gets 2 tails. In this case, George will get 1 tail, and there is a $\\frac{1}{2}$ chance that he will get exactly one head.\n## Step 6:  Case 3: Oi-Lam gets 1 tail. In this case, George will get 2 tails, and there is no chance of him getting exactly one head.\n## Step 7:  Case 4: Oi-Lam gets 0 tails. In this case, George will get 0 tails, and there is no chance of him getting exactly one head.\n## Step 8:  Now, we need to calculate the probability of each case occurring and then find the overall probability of George getting exactly one head.\n## Step 9:  The probability of Oi-Lam getting 2 tails and 1 head is $\\frac{3}{8}$, and the probability of George getting exactly one head given that Oi-Lam got 2 tails is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n## Step 10:  Therefore, the probability of George getting exactly one head given that Oi-Lam got 2 tails is $\\frac{3}{8} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{16}$.\n## Step 11:  The probability of Oi-Lam getting 2 tails is $\\frac{3}{8}$, so the overall probability of George getting exactly one head is $\\frac{3}{8} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{16}$.\n## Step 12:  Hence, the final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{16}}$",

The triangle inequality states that for any triangle with side lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side.\nStep 7:  By systematically checking all possible combinations of side lengths for each perimeter value, we can determine the number of valid triangles and find the values of $T(10), T(11),$ and $T(12)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

This is known as the triangle inequality.\n## Step 3:  We also know that the perimeter of the triangle is $n$, so we can express the side lengths as $a$, $b$, and $c$, where $a+b+c=n$.\n## Step 4:  We can use the triangle inequality to derive the condition $a+b>c$, $a+c>b$, and $b+c>a$.\n## Step 5:  Additionally, we can use the fact that the area of the triangle is positive to derive the condition $a+b>c$.\n## Step 6:  We can then use the given condition $a+b+c=n$ to express $c$ in terms of $a$ and $b$ as $c=n-a-b$.\n## Step 7:  Substituting this expression for $c$ into the inequality $a+b>c$, we get $a+b>n-a-b$, which simplifies to $2a+2b>n$.\n## Step 8:  Dividing both sides of the inequality by $2$, we get $a+b>\\frac{n}{2}$.\n## Step 9:  This inequality gives us a condition for the sum of the two smaller sides of the triangle to be greater than half the perimeter.\n## Step 10:  We can then use this inequality to derive a condition for the number of triangles with a given perimeter $n$.\n## Step 11:  By considering the possible values of $a$ and $b$ that satisfy the inequality $a+b>\\frac{n}{2}$, we can count the number of triangles with a given perimeter $n$.\n## Step 12:  We can then use this count to determine the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $T(n)>2010$.\n## Step 13:  By analyzing the possible values of $a$ and $b$ that satisfy the inequality $a+b>\\frac{n}{2}$, we can find the smallest value of $n$ that satisfies the condition $T(n)>2010$.\n## Step 14:  This will involve finding the smallest value of $n$ such that the number of triangles with a given perimeter $n$ exceeds $2010$.\n## Step 15:  We can then use this value of $n$ as our final answer.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2035}$",

We are given a right-angled triangle $\\triangle ABC$ with $AB=n(n+1)$ and $AC=(n+1)(n+4)$, where $n$ is a positive integer. We are required to find the number of positive integers $n<100000$ for which the length of side $BC$ is also an integer.\nStep 2:  The length of side $BC$ can be found using the Pythagorean Theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. Therefore, we have $BC^2 = AB^2 + AC^2$.\nStep 3:  Substituting the given values for $AB$ and $AC$, we get $BC^2 = n^2(n+1)^2 + (n+1)^2(n+4)^2$.\nStep 4:  Simplifying this expression, we get $BC^2 = n^2(n+1)^2 + (n+1)^2(n^2+8n+16)$.\nStep 5:  Further simplifying, we get $BC^2 = (n^2+8n+16)(n+1)^2$.\nStep 6:  We can factorize this expression as $BC^2 = (n^2+8n+16)(n^2+2n+1)$.\nStep 7:  This can be further simplified to $BC^2 = (n^2+8n+16)(n^2+2n+1) = (n+4)^2(n+1)^2$.\nStep 8:  Taking the square root of both sides, we get $BC = (n+4)(n+1)$.\nStep 9:  For $BC$ to be an integer, $(n+4)(n+1)$ must be a product of two consecutive integers, which is always an integer.\nStep 10:  However, we need to ensure that $n+4$ and $n+1$ are both positive integers, as $n$ is a positive integer.\nStep 11:  This means that $n+1$ must be greater than $1$ and $n+4$ must be greater than $1$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, we need to find the number of positive integers $n<100000$ that satisfy these conditions.\nStep 13:  We can start by finding the maximum value of $n$ such that $n+4<100000$, which gives us $n<99996$.\nStep 14:  We also need to ensure that $n+1>1$, which means $n>0$.\nStep 15:  Therefore, we need to find the number of positive integers $n$ such that $0<n<99996$.\nStep 16:  This can be calculated as $99996-0+1=99997$.\nStep 17:  However, we need to subtract the number of values of $n$ for which $n+1$ and $n+4$ are not both positive integers.\nStep 18:  This occurs when $n+1$ is a multiple of $4$, which happens for $n=3,7,11,15,...,99991$.\nStep 19:  There are $\\frac{99991-3}{4}+1=24999$ such values of $n$.\nStep 20:  Therefore, the number of positive integers $n<100000$ for which the length of side $BC$ is also an integer is $99997-24999=\\boxed{74998}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{74998}$",
  "Step 1:  The given equation involves logarithmic and square root functions, and we are required to find the real values of $x$ that satisfy the equation.\nStep 2:  To simplify the equation, we start by letting $y=\\log _{2} x$. This substitution allows us to rewrite the equation in terms of $y$.\nStep 3:  Substituting $y$ into the original equation, we get $\\sqrt{y(y+2)+1}+\\sqrt{y(y-6)+9}=4$.\nStep 4:  We then square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square roots, which gives us $y(y+2)+1+y(y-6)+9=16$.\nStep 5:  Simplifying this equation, we get $2 y^{2}-4 y-6=0$.\nStep 6:  We can solve this quadratic equation by factoring or using the quadratic formula. Factoring gives us $(y-3)(2 y+2)=0$.\nStep 7:  Setting each factor equal to zero, we find the possible values of $y$ as $y=3$ or $y=-1$.\nStep 8:  However, we need to check the validity of these solutions by substituting them back into the original equation.\nStep 9:  For $y=3$, we have $\\sqrt{3 \\cdot 5+1}+\\sqrt{3 \\cdot(-3)+9}=4$, which simplifies to $\\sqrt{16}+\\sqrt{0}=4$, and this is true.\nStep 10:  For $y=-1$, we have $\\sqrt{-1 \\cdot 1+1}+\\sqrt{-1 \\cdot(-7)+9}=4$, which simplifies to $\\sqrt{0}+\\sqrt{16}=4$, and this is also true.\nStep 11:  However, we need to check if these values of $y$ correspond to valid values of $x$.\nStep 12:  For $y=3$, we have $\\log _{2} x=3$, which gives us $x=2^{3}=8$.\nStep 13:  For $y=-1$, we have $\\log _{2} x=-1$, which gives us $x=2^{-1}=\\frac{1}{2}$.\nStep 14:  Therefore, the real values of $x$ that satisfy the given equation are $x=8$ and $x=\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$",

This is because the first two fractions in each set of three will have a floor value of $0$, and the third fraction will have a floor value of $1$.\nStep 5:  Since we have a total of $60$ terms in the sequence, we can divide this into sets of three, with $20$ sets in total. This means that the sum of the floor functions for these $20$ sets will be $20 \\times 1 = 20$.\nStep 6:  However, we need to consider the remaining two terms, $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{59}{3}\\right\\rfloor$ and $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{60}{3}\\right\\rfloor$. The floor of $\\frac{59}{3}$ is $19$ and the floor of $\\frac{60}{3}$ is $20$.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the sum of the floor functions for the entire sequence is $20 + 19 + 20 = \\boxed{59}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{59}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve for the values of $a, h,$ and $k$, we need to equate the two given equations and compare their coefficients.\nStep 2:  The first equation is in the form $y=a(x-2)(x+4)$, and the second equation is in the form $y=2(x-h)^{2}+k$.\nStep 3:  We can start by expanding the first equation to get it in the same form as the second equation. Expanding $y=a(x-2)(x+4)$ gives us $y=a(x^{2}+2x-8)$.\nStep 4:  Now, we can compare the coefficients of the two equations. The coefficient of $x^{2}$ in the first equation is $a$, and the coefficient of $x^{2}$ in the second equation is $2$.\nStep 5:  Equating the coefficients of $x^{2}$ gives us $a=2$.\nStep 6:  Next, we need to find the values of $h$ and $k$.

Equating these gives us $-8a=k$.\nStep 12:  Substituting $a=2$ into the equation $-8a=k$ gives us $k=-16$.\nStep 13:  Therefore, the values of $a, h,$ and $k$ are $a=2$, $h=-2$, and $k=-16$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2, -2, -16}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the properties of an arithmetic sequence and how to represent it mathematically.\nStep 2:  An arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers in which the difference between any two successive members is a constant. This constant difference is called the common difference.\nStep 3:  Let's denote the first term of the sequence as $a$, the common difference as $d$, and the number of terms as $n$. In this case, we have 5 terms, so $n=5$.\nStep 4:  The general formula for the $k$th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by $a_k = a + (k-1)d$.\nStep 5:  We are given that the first term $a_1 = 5$, and we need to find the possible values of the fifth term $a_5$.\nStep 6:  The sum of the squares of the first 3 terms equals the sum of the squares of the last 2 terms.

In this case, the fifth term is also 5.\nStep 14:  If $d=-\\frac{10}{11}$, then we can find the fifth term using the formula $a_5 = a + (n-1)d = 5 + (5-1)(-\\frac{10}{11}) = 5 - \\frac{40}{11} = \\frac{15}{11}$.\nStep 15:  Therefore, the possible values of the fifth term are 5 and $\\frac{15}{11}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$",

The distance between points $A(1,2)$ and $B(11,2)$ can be found using the distance formula, which is $\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$.

Using the distance formula again, we get $\\sqrt{(k - 1)^2 + (6 - 2)^2} = \\sqrt{(k - 1)^2 + 16}$.\n## Step 4:  The distance between points $B(11,2)$ and $C(k,6)$ can be found using the distance formula as well, which gives us $\\sqrt{(k - 11)^2 + (6 - 2)^2} = \\sqrt{(k - 11)^2 + 16}$.\n## Step 5:  Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to set up an equation. We know that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, the length of the hypotenuse is the distance between points $A$ and $B$, which is $10$.

We know that Linh is driving at a speed of $60 \\mathrm{~km} / \\mathrm{h}$.\nStep 3:  The problem states that every 10 minutes, Linh is passed by a train traveling in the same direction as she is. This means that the relative speed of the train with respect to Linh is the speed of the train minus the speed of Linh's car.\nStep 4:  We can express this as $v-60$ km/h.\nStep 5:  Additionally, the problem mentions that these trains depart from the station behind her every 3 minutes. This implies that the time interval between the trains is 3 minutes, which is equivalent to $\\frac{1}{20}$ hours.\nStep 6:  Using the formula for relative speed, we can set up the equation $\\frac{v-60}{v}=\\frac{1}{20}$ to represent the relationship between the speed of the train and the time interval between the trains.\nStep 7:  Solving for $v$, we can find the constant speed of the trains in km/h.\nStep 8:  By solving the equation, we can determine the value of $v$ and obtain the final answer.\nStep 9:  Therefore, we can calculate the constant speed of the trains as $v = \\frac{60}{1-\\frac{1}{20}} = \\frac{60}{\\frac{19}{20}} = \\frac{1200}{19} = 63.15789473684211$ km/h.\nStep 10:  Rounding to the nearest whole number, the constant speed of the trains is approximately $\\boxed{63}$ km/h.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{63}$",

Since the number of atoms is halved every 6 minutes, in 24 minutes, it will have halved 24/6 = 4 times.\nStep 6:  This means that the initial ratio of 2:1 has been reduced to 1:1 after 4 halving periods, which is equivalent to 24 minutes.\nStep 7:  Now, we need to find out how long it takes for the number of atoms of isotope B to halve. Since the number of atoms of isotope A is halved every 6 minutes, we can use the same time period to find the time it takes for the number of atoms of isotope B to halve.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the time it takes for the number of atoms of isotope B to halve is also 6 minutes.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$",

  "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find all even savage integers less than 100. This means we are looking for positive even integers $n$ that can be partitioned into three sets $A, B,$ and $C$ such that the sum of the elements in each set is the same.\n## Step 2:  We start by considering the properties of the sets $A, B,$ and $C$. Set $A$ contains only odd numbers, set $B$ contains only even numbers, and set $C$ contains every multiple of 3 (and possibly other numbers).\n## Step 3:  We can represent the sum of the elements in each set as $S$. Since the sum of the elements in each set is the same, we have $S = \\sum_{a \\in A} a = \\sum_{b \\in B} b = \\sum_{c \\in C} c$.\n## Step 4:  We also know that the sum of the elements in set $C$ is the sum of all the multiples of 3 from 3 to $n$, which can be represented as $\\frac{n(n+2)}{6}$.\n## Step 5:  We can then express the sum of the elements in set $A$ as $S - \\frac{n(n+2)}{6}$, and the sum of the elements in set $B$ as $S - \\frac{n(n+2)}{6} - S = -\\frac{n(n+2)}{6}$.\n## Step 6:  Since the sum of the elements in set $B$ is the sum of all the even numbers from 2 to $n$, we can express it as $\\frac{n(n+2)}{4}$.\n## Step 7:  Equating the two expressions for the sum of the elements in set $B$, we get $\\frac{n(n+2)}{4} = -\\frac{n(n+2)}{6}$.\n## Step 8:  Solving for $n$, we find that $n = 6$ or $n = -2$. Since we are looking for positive even integers, we discard $n = -2$.\n## Step 9:  Therefore, the only even savage integer less than 100 is $n = 6$.\n## Step 10:  However, we need to consider the case where $n$ is a multiple of 6. In this case, we can partition the numbers from 1 to $n$ into three sets $A, B,$ and $C$ such that the sum of the elements in each set is the same.\n## Step 11:  We can let $A$ contain the odd numbers from 1 to $n-1$, $B$ contain the even numbers from 2 to $n-2$, and $C$ contain the numbers $n$ and all the multiples of 3 from 3 to $n-3$.\n## Step 12:  This partition satisfies the conditions of the problem, and we can verify that the sum of the elements in each set is the same.\n## Step 13:  Therefore, we need to find all even multiples of 6 less than 100.\n## Step 14:  The even multiples of 6 less than 100 are 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, and 96.\n## Step 15:  Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96}",

A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\nStep 2:  We are given two identical dice, each with six faces numbered 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13. We want to find the probability that the sum of the numbers on the top faces of the two dice is a prime number.\nStep 3:  To do this, we need to consider all the possible outcomes when rolling the two dice and then determine which of these outcomes result in a prime sum.\nStep 4:  The possible sums when rolling two dice range from 2 (when both dice show 1) to 26 (when both dice show 13). However, since the numbers on the dice are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, the possible sums are limited to these values.\nStep 5:  We can list out all the possible sums and then identify which of these sums are prime numbers.\nStep 6:  The prime sums that can be obtained from the given dice are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.\nStep 7:  Now, we need to count the number of ways to obtain each of these prime sums.

  "Problem: Determine all linear functions $f(x)=a x+b$ such that if $g(x)=f^{-1}(x)$ for all values of $x$, then $f(x)-g(x)=44$ for all values of $x$. (Note: $f^{-1}$ is the inverse function of $f$.)\nStep 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first understand the relationship between a function and its inverse. The inverse of a function essentially undoes the action of the original function. In other words, if we have a function $f(x)$ and its inverse $g(x)$, then $f(g(x)) = x$ and $g(f(x)) = x$ for all $x$ in the domain of the functions.\nStep 2:  Given that $g(x) = f^{-1}(x)$, we know that $f(g(x)) = x$ for all $x$. This means that the composition of $f$ and $g$ results in the original input $x$.\nStep 3:  We are also given that $f(x) - g(x) = 44$ for all values of $x$. This equation represents the difference between the function $f(x)$ and its inverse $g(x)$.\nStep 4:  To find the linear functions $f(x)$ that satisfy these conditions, we can start by expressing $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ in terms of $a$ and $b$, where $f(x) = ax + b$ and $g(x) = \\frac{1}{a} x - \\frac{b}{a}$.\nStep 5:  Substituting these expressions into the equation $f(x) - g(x) = 44$, we get $ax + b - \\left( \\frac{1}{a} x - \\frac{b}{a} \\right) = 44$.\nStep 6:  Simplifying this equation, we get $(a - \\frac{1}{a}) x + \\frac{2b}{a} = 44$.\nStep 7:  Since this equation must hold for all values of $x$, the coefficients of $x$ and the constant term must be equal on both sides of the equation.\nStep 8:  Equating the coefficients of $x$, we get $a - \\frac{1}{a} = 0$, which simplifies to $a^2 = 1$. This gives us two possible values for $a$: $a = 1$ and $a = -1$.\nStep 9:  Substituting these values of $a$ back into the equation $(a - \\frac{1}{a}) x + \\frac{2b}{a} = 44$, we can solve for $b$ in each case.\nStep 10:  For $a = 1$, we get $2b = 44$, which gives us $b = 22$.\nStep 11:  For $a = -1$, we get $-2b = 44$, which gives us $b = -22$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the linear functions $f(x)$ that satisfy the given conditions are $f(x) = x + 22$ and $f(x) = -x - 22$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",

The first step is to combine the logarithms on the left-hand side using the product rule of logarithms, which states that $\\log_b (m) + \\log_b (n) = \\log_b (m \\cdot n)$.\nStep 3:  Applying this property, we get $\\log_{5x+9} (x^2+6x+9) + \\log_{x+3} (5x^2+24x+27) = \\log_{5x+9} (x^2+6x+9) + \\log_{x+3} (5x^2+24x+27) = \\log_{5x+9} (x^2+6x+9) \\cdot \\log_{x+3} (5x^2+24x+27)$.\nStep 4:  We then use the property that $\\log_b (m) \\cdot \\log_b (n) = (\\log_b (m))^2$ to simplify further. This gives us $(\\log_{5x+9} (x^2+6x+9))^2 = 4$.\nStep 5:  Taking the square root of both sides, we get $\\log_{5x+9} (x^2+6x+9) = \\pm 2$.\nStep 6:  We then consider the two cases separately: $\\log_{5x+9} (x^2+6x+9) = 2$ and $\\log_{5x+9} (x^2+6x+9) = -2$.\nStep 7:  For the first case, we have $x^2+6x+9 = (5x+9)^2$. Simplifying this equation, we get $x^2+6x+9 = 25x^2+90x+81$, which further simplifies to $24x^2+84x+72=0$.\nStep 8:  Factoring this quadratic equation, we get $6x^2+28x+24=0$, which can be factored as $2(3x+4)(x+3)=0$.

In the context of the triangle, this means that the side lengths can be represented as $a-d, a, a+d$, where $a$ is the middle side length and $d$ is the common difference between the terms.\n## Step 3:  Since the side lengths form an arithmetic sequence, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate the side lengths of the triangle. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n## Step 4:  In this case, we have the equation $(a-d)^2 + a^2 = (a+d)^2$, which simplifies to $2a^2 - 2ad = 2a^2 + 2ad$. This further simplifies to $4ad = 0$, which implies that $a = 0$ or $d = 0$. However, since $a$ and $d$ are side lengths, they cannot be zero, so we must have $a = 60$.\n## Step 5:  Now, we can use the fact that the side lengths form an arithmetic sequence to find the possible values for the area of the triangle.

This gives us $(a-50)^2+(b-50)^2=50^2$.\nStep 9:  From this equation, we can see that the pairs $(a,b)$ must satisfy the condition $(a-50)^2+(b-50)^2=50^2$.\nStep 10:  We can now find the pairs of positive integers $(a, b)$ that satisfy this equation.\nStep 11:  The pairs of positive integers $(a, b)$ that satisfy the equation are $(1, 49)$ and $(49, 1)$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the two pairs of positive integers $(a, b)$ with $a<b$ that satisfy the equation $\\sqrt{a}+\\sqrt{b}=\\sqrt{50}$ are $(1, 49)$ and $(49, 1)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\left( 1, \\  49\\right)}",

Step 1: To find the points of intersection, we need to set the two equations equal to each other and solve for x. This is because at the points of intersection, the y-values of the two graphs will be the same. Step 2: Set the two equations equal to each other: $\\log _{10}(x-2)=1-\\log _{10}(x+1)$. Step 3: Use the properties of logarithms to simplify the equation. We can rewrite $1-\\log _{10}(x+1)$ as $\\log _{10}\\left(\\frac{10}{x+1}\\right)$. So the equation becomes $\\log _{10}(x-2)=\\log _{10}\\left(\\frac{10}{x+1}\\right)$. Step 4: Since the bases of the logarithms are the same, we can equate the expressions inside the logarithms: $x-2=\\frac{10}{x+1}$.

A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same backward as forward.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the construction of palindromes in the sequence\nGiven the construction rule, we can see that every term after the second will be a palindrome because it is constructed by appending the reverse of the previous second term to the previous first term. This means that every term after the second will be a palindrome.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the number of palindromes in the first 1000 terms\nSince every term after the second is a palindrome, and we are looking at the first 1000 terms, we need to count how many terms are palindromes. The first two terms are not palindromes, but from the third term onwards, all terms are palindromes.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of palindromes\nSince the first two terms are not palindromes, we subtract 2 from the total number of terms to find the number of palindromes. The total number of terms is 1000, so the number of palindromes is 1000 - 2 = 998.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{998}$",

This can be expressed in base 10 as $14^{2}a+14b+a=196a+14b+a$.\nStep 5:  We want to find the smallest value of $N$ that satisfies this condition and is greater than 20.\nStep 6:  To do this, we need to find the smallest values of $a$ and $b$ such that $196a+14b+a>20$.\nStep 7:  We start by trying $a=1$, which gives us $196+14b+1>20$, or $14b>-5$. Since $b$ is a non-negative integer, we can try $b=0$ and see if it satisfies the condition.\nStep 8:  If $b=0$, then $196a+a=197a$, and we need to find the smallest value of $a$ such that $197a>20$.\nStep 9:  Trying $a=1$ gives us $197>20$, so $a=1$ and $b=0$ satisfy the condition.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the smallest three-digit palindrome in base 14 is $1103_{14}$, which is equal to $1\\cdot 14^{3}+1\\cdot 14^{2}+0\\cdot 14^{1}+3\\cdot 14^{0}=14^{3}+14^{2}+3=2743$ in base 10.\nStep 11:  Now, we need to check if $2743$ is a palindrome in base 20.

We can use Vieta's formulas to find these roots.\nStep 3:  Vieta's formulas state that for a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$, the sum of the roots is $-b/a$ and the product of the roots is $c/a$.\nStep 4:  In this case, the sum of the roots is $3T$ and the product of the roots is $T^2$.\nStep 5:  Let's denote the roots as $x_1$ and $x_2$. We have the equations $x_1 + x_2 = 3T$ and $x_1 \\cdot x_2 = T^2$.\nStep 6:  We are given that $T=20$, so we can substitute this value into the equations to find the values of $x_1$ and $x_2$.\nStep 7:  Substituting $T=20$ into the equation $x_1 + x_2 = 3T$, we get $x_1 + x_2 = 3 \\cdot 20 = 60$.\nStep 8:  Substituting $T=20$ into the equation $x_1 \\cdot x_2 = T^2$, we get $x_1 \\cdot x_2 = 20^2 = 400$.\nStep 9:  Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the diagonal of the rectangle. The diagonal is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle with sides $x_1$ and $x_2$.\nStep 10:  The Pythagorean theorem states that for a right-angled triangle with sides of length $a$ and $b$, and hypotenuse of length $c$, we have $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$.\nStep 11:  In this case, we have $c^2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2$. We can use the values of $x_1$ and $x_2$ we found earlier to calculate the length of the diagonal.\nStep 12:  Since we have $x_1 + x_2 = 60$ and $x_1 \\cdot x_2 = 400$, we can use the identity $(x_1 + x_2)^2 = x_1^2 + 2x_1x_2 + x_2^2$ to find $x_1^2 + x_2^2$.\nStep 13:  Substituting the values, we get $(x_1 + x_2)^2 = 60^2 = 3600$, and $2x_1x_2 = 2 \\cdot 400 = 800$.\nStep 14:  Therefore, $x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 3600 - 800 = 2800$.\nStep 15:  Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the diagonal: $c^2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 2800$.\nStep 16:  Taking the square root of both sides, we get $c = \\sqrt{2800} = \\boxed{52.91}$ (rounded to two decimal places).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{52.91}$",

The height of each segment is determined by the ceiling function, which rounds up the value of $x$ to the nearest integer.\nStep 4:  To find the area under this graph, we can break it down into separate regions, each corresponding to a specific interval of $x$.

  "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length $k$ in $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$. We can start by considering the properties of a resident cycle. A resident cycle is a sequence of distinct residents $r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{n}$ such that for each $1 \\leq i \\leq n-1$, the residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$ know how to make a common dish, residents $r_{n}$ and $r_{1}$ know how to make a common dish, and no other pair of residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}, 1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$ know how to make a common dish.\n\nWe can use the properties of a resident cycle to derive a formula for the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length $k$ in $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$. Let's consider the common dishes that the residents in the cycle know how to make. Since each resident knows how to make exactly two dishes, the common dishes must be a pair of dishes that are known by exactly two residents in the cycle.\n\nLet's denote the common dishes as $D_{1}, D_{2}, \\ldots, D_{k-1}$. Since each resident knows how to make exactly two dishes, the residents in the cycle must be able to make each of the common dishes. This means that for each common dish $D_{i}$, there must be exactly two residents in the cycle who know how to make $D_{i}$.\n\nWe can use this information to count the number of ways to choose the residents in the cycle. For each common dish $D_{i}$, we need to choose two residents who know how to make $D_{i}$. Since there are $d$ dishes in total, and each resident knows how to make exactly two dishes, there are $\\binom{d}{2}$ ways to choose the common dishes.\n\nFor each common dish $D_{i}$, we need to choose two residents who know how to make $D_{i}$. Since there are $d$ residents in total, and each resident knows how to make exactly two dishes, there are $\\binom{d}{2}$ ways to choose the residents who know how to make $D_{i}$.\n\nSince the residents in the cycle must be able to make each of the common dishes, we need to choose the residents in the cycle in such a way that each resident knows how to make exactly two common dishes. This means that for each common dish $D_{i}$, we need to choose two residents who know how to make $D_{i}$, and these two residents must be different from the residents who know how to make the other common dishes.\n\nWe can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to count the number of ways to choose the residents in the cycle. Let's denote the set of residents who know how to make the common dish $D_{i}$ as $S_{i}$. We need to choose two residents from each set $S_{i}$, and these two residents must be different from the residents who know how to make the other common dishes.\n\nUsing the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we can count the number of ways to choose the residents in the cycle as follows:\n\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{k-1} \\binom{d}{2} - \\sum_{i=1}^{k-1} \\binom{d-2}{2} + \\sum_{i=1}^{k-1} \\binom{d-4}{2} - \\cdots$$\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{d(d-1)}{2} - \\frac{(d-2)(d-3)}{2} + \\frac{(d-4)(d-5)}{2} - \\cdots$$\n\nThis is a telescoping series, and it simplifies to:\n\n$$\\frac{d(d-1)}{2} - \\frac{(d-k+1)(d-k+2)}{2}$$\n\nThis is the number of ways to choose the residents in the cycle, given that the common dishes are $D_{1}, D_{2}, \\ldots, D_{k-1}$.\n\nSince the common dishes are chosen in $\\binom{d}{2}$ ways, the total number of distinguishable resident cycles of length $k$ in $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$ is:\n\n$$\\binom{d}{2} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{d(d-1)}{2} - \\frac{(d-k+1)(d-k+2)}{2}\\right)$$\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{d(d-1)(d-k+1)(d-k+2)}{4}$$\n\nThis is the final answer.\n\n\\boxed{\\frac{d(d-1)(d-k+1)(d-k+2)}{4}}",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of repeating decimals and how to convert them into fractions.\nStep 2:  The given repeating decimal is $.0 \\overline{0231846597}$, which means that the sequence $0231846597$ repeats indefinitely.\nStep 3:  Let's denote the repeating decimal as $x$ and subtract it from $1000000x$ to eliminate the repeating part.\nStep 4:  The subtraction process can be represented as follows:\nStep 5:  $1000000x - x = 1000000 \\cdot 0.\\overline{0231846597} - 0.\\overline{0231846597}$\nStep 6:  This simplifies to $999999x = 23.1846597 \\overline{0231846597} - 0.\\overline{0231846597}$\nStep 7:  After performing the subtraction, we get $999999x = 23.1846597$.\nStep 8:  Now, we can solve for $x$ by dividing both sides by $999999$, giving us $x = \\frac{23.1846597}{999999}$.\nStep 9:  To find the value of $N$, we need to find the denominator of the fraction $\\frac{23.1846597}{999999}$.\nStep 10:  The denominator of the fraction is $999999$, which is the value of $N$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the value of $N$ is $\\boxed{999999}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{999999}$",

  "Problem: Compute the sum of the reciprocals of the positive integer divisors of 24.\nStep 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find all the positive integer divisors of 24 and then compute the sum of their reciprocals.\nStep 2:  First, let's list out all the positive divisors of 24. These are the numbers that divide 24 without leaving a remainder.\nStep 3:  The divisors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24.\nStep 4:  Now, we need to find the reciprocals of these divisors. The reciprocal of a number is 1 divided by that number.\nStep 5:  So, the reciprocals of the divisors of 24 are 1/1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/6, 1/8, 1/12, and 1/24.\nStep 6:  Next, we need to find the sum of these reciprocals. This involves adding all these fractions together.\nStep 7:  To add fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 is 24.\nStep 8:  Now, we can rewrite each fraction with the common denominator of 24.\nStep 9:  The sum of the reciprocals of the divisors of 24 is (24/24) + (12/24) + (8/24) + (6/24) + (4/24) + (3/24) + (2/24) + (1/24).\nStep 10:  Adding these fractions together, we get (24 + 12 + 8 + 6 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1)/24.\nStep 11:  Simplifying the numerator, we get 60/24.\nStep 12:  We can simplify this fraction further by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 12.\nStep 13:  Dividing both 60 and 24 by 12, we get 5/2.\nStep 14:  Therefore, the sum of the reciprocals of the positive integer divisors of 24 is 5/2.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{2}}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first understand the geometric setup and the conditions given.\nStep 2:  We have a right triangle with legs of length $2 \\sqrt{3}$ and 4. The problem asks for the probability that the distance between a randomly selected point from the interior of the triangle and the nearest vertex is less than 2.\nStep 3:  To approach this, we can divide the triangle into regions based on their distance from the vertices. We'll consider the points that are less than 2 units away from each vertex and calculate the areas of these regions.\nStep 4:  First, we'll consider the points that are less than 2 units away from vertex $A$. This forms a region that is the union of two triangles, each with base length 2 and height $\\sqrt{3}$, and a rectangle with side lengths 2 and 4.\nStep 5:  The area of the region for vertex $A$ is calculated as the sum of the areas of the two triangles and the rectangle, which equals $2 \\sqrt{3} + 8$.\nStep 6:  Next, we'll consider the points that are less than 2 units away from vertex $C$. This forms a region that is the union of two triangles, each with base length 2 and height $\\sqrt{3}$, and a rectangle with side lengths 2 and 4.\nStep 7:  The area of the region for vertex $C$ is also calculated as the sum of the areas of the two triangles and the rectangle, which equals $2 \\sqrt{3} + 8$.\nStep 8:  The total area of the triangle is calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle, which is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 2 \\sqrt{3} \\cdot 4 = 4 \\sqrt{3}$.\nStep 9:  The probability $p$ is then calculated as the ratio of the total area of the regions to the total area of the triangle, which is $\\frac{2 \\sqrt{3} + 8}{4 \\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\pi$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the probability $p$ can be written in the form $a + \\sqrt{b} \\pi$, where $a = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $b = 3$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, 3\\right)}",

This gives us the vertices of the square.\nStep 3:  We are looking for the shortest path that touches three of the four sides of the square. This means the path will be a straight line that intersects the square at three of its sides.\nStep 4:  To find this path, we can consider the line $y = x$ which passes through the point $(2/7,3/7)$. This line intersects the square at the points $(0,0)$, $(1,1)$, and $(2/7,3/7)$.\nStep 5:  The shortest path from the point $(2/7,3/7)$ to itself that touches three of the four sides of the square is the line segment from $(2/7,3/7)$ to $(0,0)$, then to $(1,1)$, and finally back to $(2/7,3/7)$.\nStep 6:  The length of this path can be calculated using the distance formula, which is the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences in the x and y coordinates.\nStep 7:  The distance from $(2/7,3/7)$ to $(0,0)$ is $\\sqrt{(2/7)^2 + (3/7)^2} = \\sqrt{13/49}$.\nStep 8:  The distance from $(0,0)$ to $(1,1)$ is $\\sqrt{(1-0)^2 + (1-0)^2} = \\sqrt{2}$.\nStep 9:  The distance from $(1,1)$ to $(2/7,3/7)$ is $\\sqrt{(2/7-1)^2 + (3/7-1)^2} = \\sqrt{13/49}$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the total length of the shortest path is $\\sqrt{13/49} + \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{13/49}$.\nStep 11:  Simplifying this expression, we get $2\\sqrt{13/49} + \\sqrt{2}$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the length of the shortest path from the point $(2/7,3/7)$ to itself that touches three of the four sides of square $A R M L$ is $2\\sqrt{13/49} + \\sqrt{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2\\sqrt{13/49} + \\sqrt{2}}",

1)k^2$.\nStep 4:  We are looking for values of $k$ such that $306$ is a term in the sequence $S_{k}$, which implies that $k + (n - 1)k^2 = 306$ for some positive integer $n$.\nStep 5:  Rearranging the equation, we get $k^2(n -

We also know that $a_{20}+b_{14}=1000$.\nStep 3:  Let's start by understanding the relationship between the terms in the sequences. We can express the terms in the sequences as $a_i = a_1 + (i - 1) d_a$ and $b_i = b_1 + (i - 1) d_b$, where $d_a$ and $d_b$ are the common differences of the sequences.\nStep 4:  We are given that $a_{20}+b_{14}=1000$, which can be expressed as $a_1 + 19d_a + b_1 + 13d_b = 1000$.\nStep 5:  We are also given that $a_{20} = b_1 + 13d_b$ and $b_{14} = a_1 + 19d_a$. Substituting these into the equation $a_{20}+b_{14}=1000$, we get $2(a_1 + b_1 + 13d_a + 19d_b) = 1000$.\nStep 6:  This simplifies to $a_1 + b_1 + 13d_a + 19d_b = 500$. We can use this equation to find the relationship between $a_1 + b_1$ and $13d_a + 19d_b$.\nStep 7:  We also know that $a_1 + b_1$ must be even, as it is the sum of two positive integers. This means that $13d_a + 19d_b$ must be even as well.\nStep 8:  To minimize $b_{20}+a_{14}$, we need to minimize $b_{20}$ and $a_{14}$.

Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the ordered triple $(x, y, z)$ representing the farthest lattice point from the origin that satisfies the given equations.\nStep 2:  We are given the equations $x y-z^{2}=y^{2} z-x=14$. Our goal is to find the values of $x$, $y$, and $z$ that satisfy these equations and are the farthest from the origin.\nStep 3:  We start by manipulating the given equations to simplify them and make them easier to work with. We can rewrite the first equation as $x y - z^2 = 14$ and the second equation as $y^2 z - x = 14$.\nStep 4:  By subtracting the second equation from the first, we obtain $x y - y^2 z - z^2 + x = 0$. This simplifies to $x (y - 1) - z^2 (y + 1) = 0$.\nStep 5:  We can factor out a common term of $(y - 1)$ from the first two terms to get $(y - 1)(x - z^2) = 0$. This gives us two possible cases: either $y - 1 = 0$ or $x - z^2 = 0$.\nStep 6:  If $y - 1 = 0$, then $y = 1$. Substituting this value of $y$ into the second equation $y^2 z - x = 14$, we get $z - x = 14$. This leads to the solution $(x, y, z) = (14, 1, 15)$.\nStep 7:  If $x - z^2 = 0$, then $x = z^2$. Substituting this value of $x$ into the first equation $x y - z^2 = 14$, we get $z^2 y - z^2 = 14$. This simplifies to $z^2 (y - 1) = 14$.\nStep 8:  Since $z^2$ is a perfect square, we can conclude that $y - 1$ is also a perfect square. Let's denote $y - 1 = a^2$, where $a$ is an integer. This gives us $z^2 = \\frac{14}{a^2}$.\nStep 9:  We know that $z^2$ is a perfect square, so $\\frac{14}{a^2}$ must also be a perfect square.

For $a = 7$, we get $z^2 = 2$, which is not a perfect square. For $a = 14$, we get $z^2 = 1$, which is a perfect square.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the only valid solution is $(x, y, z) = (14, 1, 15)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(14, 1, 15)}$",

First, we can solve the equation $c/a = 8$ for $c$ to get $c = 8a$.\nStep 6:  Substituting $c = 8a$ into the equation $20 = 4a - 2b + c$, we get $20 = 4a - 2b + 8a$, which simplifies to $12a - 2b = 20$.\nStep 7:  Similarly, substituting $c = 8a$ into the equation $14 = a + b + c$, we get $14 = a + b + 8a$, which simplifies to $9a + b = 14$.\nStep 8:  Now we have a system of two equations with two variables: $12a - 2b = 20$ and $9a + b = 14$. We can solve this system to find the values of $a$ and $b$.\nStep 9:  Multiplying the second equation by $2$ gives us $18a + 2b = 28$. Adding this equation to the first equation $12a - 2b = 20$ eliminates the variable $b$, resulting in $30a = 48$.\nStep 10:  Solving for $a$, we find that $a = 48/30 = 8/5$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the value of $a$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{8}{5}}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{8}{5}}",

  "Solve the following math problem with clear step\u2011by\u2011step reasoning.\nStep 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the number of quadratic functions $f(x)=ax^2+bx+c$ with integer roots and integer coefficients whose graphs pass through the points $(0,0)$ and $(15,225)$.\nStep 2:  First, we note that since the graph of $f$ passes through $(0,0)$, we have $c=0$. This simplifies our function to $f(x)=ax^2+bx$.\nStep 3:  Next, we use the fact that the graph of $f$ passes through $(15,225)$. Substituting these values into the function gives us $225=a(15)^2+b(15)$, which simplifies to $225=225a+15b$.\nStep 4:  We can rewrite this equation as $15b=-225a+225$, and then further simplify it to $b=-15a+15$.\nStep 5:  Now, we need to find the integer values of $a$ and $b$ that satisfy this equation. We can express $b$ in terms of $a$ as $b=-15a+15$.\nStep 6:  Since the roots of $f(x)$ are integers, we know that the discriminant $b^2-4ac$ must be a perfect square. Substituting $c=0$ and $b=-15a+15$ into the discriminant gives us $(-15a+15)^2-4a(0)$, which simplifies to $225a^2-450a+225$.\nStep 7:  We can factor this expression as $225(a^2-2a+1)$, which further simplifies to $225(a-1)^2$.\nStep 8:  Since the discriminant is a perfect square, we have $225(a-1)^2=k^2$ for some integer $k$. This implies that $a-1=\\pm\\frac{k}{15}$.\nStep 9:  Since $a$ is an integer, we must have $k=15m$ for some integer $m$. Therefore, $a-1=\\pm m$, which gives us $a=m\\pm1$.\nStep 10:  Since $a$ is an integer, we have $m\\pm1$ as the possible values for $a$.\nStep 11:  We can now find the corresponding values of $b$ using the equation $b=-15a+15$.

We can rewrite $16_b$ as $1\\cdot b^1 + 6\\cdot b^0$. This simplifies to $b+6$. For $b+6$ to be prime, $b$ must be greater than 5, since any number less than or equal to 5 is not prime.\nNext, let's consider the condition that $97_b$ is a perfect square. We can rewrite $97_b$ as $9\\cdot b^1 + 7\\cdot b^0$. This simplifies to $9b+7$. For $9b+7$ to be a perfect square, we can write it as $m^2$, where $m$ is an integer.

In this range, we have 64 numbers with no 1's, 32 numbers with one 1, 16 numbers with two 1's, 8 numbers with three 1's, 4 numbers with four 1's, 2 numbers with five 1's, and 1 number with six 1's.\nStep 6:  We can then calculate the total number of pairs of consecutive 1's for these numbers by multiplying the number of occurrences of each case by the number of pairs of consecutive 1's in that case.\nStep 7:  For example, the 16 numbers with two 1's contribute $16\\cdot1$ to the total count, the 8 numbers with three 1's contribute $8\\cdot2$ to the total count, and so on.\nStep 8:  We can then double this count to account for the numbers from 129 to 256, as the binary representation of these numbers is the same as the numbers from 1 to 128, but with the most significant bit flipped.\nStep 9:  By following this process, we can calculate the total sum of $C(n)$ for $n$ ranging from 1 to 256.\nStep 10:  After performing the calculations, we find that the total sum is $64+32+16+8+4+2+1+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16+8+4+2+1+64+32+16",

To maximize the median, we need to maximize the middle value of the set.\nStep 4:  Since the sum of the numbers in the set is 120, we can start by considering the smallest possible values for the first 6 numbers in the set, which are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The sum of these numbers is 21.\nStep 5:  To maximize the median, we want the remaining 7 numbers to be as large as possible. This means that the sum of the remaining 7 numbers should be as close to 99 as possible, which is the remaining sum after subtracting 21 from 120.\nStep 6:  To achieve this, we can assign the values 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 to the remaining 7 numbers.

We then need to show that it holds for $k+1$, i.e., $a_{k+1} = (k+1) + 5$.\nStep 10:  Using the recursive definition of $a_{n+1}$, we can express $a_{k+1}$ in terms of $a_k$ and simplify to show that $a_{k+1} = (k+1) + 5$, thus completing the induction step.\nStep 11:  Having proven that $a_n = n + 5$ for all positive integers $n$, we can now find the least value of $n$ such that $a_n > 100T$ by solving the inequality $n + 5 > 500$.\nStep 12:  This simplifies to $n > 495$, so the least value of $n$ satisfying this condition is $n = \\boxed{496}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{496}$",

To do this, we need to consider the areas of the faces of the cube that are not covered by the holes, as well as the areas of the holes themselves.\nStep 3:  The holes drilled through the cube create a smaller cube in the center, with each side of the smaller cube being $T-2=35$ units long. This is because the holes are drilled from the center of each face through the cube's center and across to the opposite face, effectively removing a square of side length 1 from each face.\nStep 4:  The surface area of the resulting solid consists of the areas of the faces of the original cube that are not covered by the holes, as well as the areas of the holes themselves.\nStep 5:  The area of each face of the original cube that is not covered by a hole is $(T-2)^2 = 35^2 = 1225$ square units. Since there are 6 faces on a cube, the total area of the faces not covered by holes is $6 \\times 1225 = 7350$ square units.\nStep 6:  Additionally, we need to consider the areas of the holes themselves.

yz$.\n## Step 2:  To approach this problem, we can start by considering the given equation $xy + z = 160$ and try to manipulate it to find a relationship between $x, y,$ and $z$ that can help us minimize $x + yz$.\n## Step 3:  We can use the AM-GM (Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean) inequality, which states that for non-negative real numbers $a$ and $b$, their arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to their geometric mean, i.e., $\\frac{a + b}{2} \\geq \\sqrt{ab}$.\n## Step 4:  Applying the AM-GM inequality to the given equation, we get $xy + z \\ge 2 \\sqrt{xy \\cdot z}$.\n## Step 5:  Substituting $xy + z = 160$ into the inequality, we have $160 \\ge 2 \\sqrt{xyz}$.\n## Step 6:  This simplifies to $40 \\ge \\sqrt{xyz}$, and further simplifies to $1600 \\ge xyz$.\n## Step 7:  We can use this inequality to find the minimum value of $x + yz$ by considering the factors of $1600$ and finding the combination that minimizes $x + yz$.\n## Step 8:  We can start by trying to find the minimum value of $x + yz$ by considering the factors of $1600$ and finding the combination that minimizes $x + yz$.\n## Step 9:  We can then use the AM-GM inequality to find the minimum value of $x + yz$.\n## Step 10:  By considering the factors of $1600$ and using the AM-GM inequality, we can find the minimum value of $x + yz$.\n## Step 11:  We can then use this minimum value to find the smallest

Therefore, the total number of arrangements for each combination is $2^5 = 32$.\nStep 7:  Multiplying the number of combinations by the number of arrangements for each combination, we get $21 \\times 32 = 672$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the total number of 15-letter palindromes that can be spelled using letters in the ARMLLexicon, among which there are four consecutive letters that spell out $A R M L$, is $\\boxed{672}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{672}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first understand the given information and what is being asked. We are given a quadrilateral $A R M L$ with side lengths $A R=20, R M=23, M L=25$, and $A M=32$. We are asked to find the number of different integers that could be the perimeter of $A R M L$.\nStep 2:  The perimeter of a quadrilateral is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. In this case, the perimeter is $A R + R M + M L + A M$. We are given the values of three of these sides, and we need to find the possible values of the fourth side, $A L$, such that the perimeter is an integer.\nStep 3:  We can use the triangle inequality to determine the possible range of values for $A L$. The triangle inequality states that in a triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side.\nStep 4:  Applying the triangle inequality to triangle $A M L$, we get $A L + M L > A M$, which simplifies to $A L > A M - M L = 32 - 25 = 7$. Similarly, for triangle $A R L$, we have $A L + A R > R M$, which gives $A L > R M - A R = 23 - 20 = 3$.\nStep 5:  Therefore, we have the inequalities $A L > 7$ and $A L > 3$, which means $A L$ must be greater than 7 and also greater than 3. This gives us the range $A L > 7$.\nStep 6:  Now, we need to find the possible values of $A L$ such that the perimeter is an integer. We can do this by finding the range of values for $A L$ that satisfy the inequality $A L > 7$ and also make the perimeter an integer.\nStep 7:  The perimeter is given by $P = A R + R M + M L + A M = 20 + 23 + 25 + 32 = 100$. We need to find the values of $A L$ that make the perimeter an integer.\nStep 8:  Since $A L$ must be greater than 7, the smallest possible value for $A L$ is 8. We can then check if the perimeter is an integer for this value of $A L$.\nStep 9:  If $A L = 8$, then the perimeter is $P = 100 + 8 = 108$. This is an integer, so $A L = 8$ is a valid solution.\nStep 10:  We can continue this process to find all the possible values of $A L$ that make the perimeter an integer.\nStep 11:  By checking all the possible values of $A L$ in the range $A L > 7$, we can find the number of different integers that could be the perimeter of $A R M L$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{9}$",

In this sequence, the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 share common factors with each other, so they are not cromulent.\nStep 13:  Therefore, the minimum possible number of cromulent elements in a sequence of $n$ consecutive positive integers with $n=6$ is 1.\nStep 14:  So, the maximum possible number of cromulent elements is 6 and the minimum possible number of cromulent elements is 1.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",
  "To find the maximum and minimum possible number of cromulent elements in a sequence of $n$ consecutive positive integers with $n=7$, we need to consider the properties of consecutive integers and the concept of being relatively prime.\nFirst, let's understand what it means for two numbers to be relatively prime. Two numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1. In other words, they have no common factors other than 1.\nNow, let's consider a sequence of $n$ consecutive positive integers. We can represent this sequence as $x, x+1, x+2, \\ldots, x+n-1$, where $x$ is the first integer in the sequence.\nTo find the maximum possible number of cromulent elements, we need to find a sequence where as many elements as possible are relatively prime to all other elements. Since the sequence is consecutive, every element will have a common factor with the first element, which is $x$. Therefore, the maximum number of cromulent elements will occur when $x$ is a prime number, as a prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself.\nIn this case, all elements in the sequence will be relatively prime to each other, as they will not share any common factors other than 1. Therefore, the maximum possible number of cromulent elements is $n$, which is 7 in this case.\nTo find the minimum possible number of cromulent elements, we need to find a sequence where as few elements as possible are relatively prime to all other elements. Since the sequence is consecutive, every element will have a common factor with the first element, which is $x$. Therefore, the minimum number of cromulent elements will occur when $x$ is a multiple of a number that is common to all elements in the sequence.\nIn this case, the minimum possible number of cromulent elements is 1, which is the first element itself. This is because the first element will always be relatively prime to all other elements in the sequence.\nTherefore, the maximum possible number of cromulent elements is 7, and the minimum possible number of cromulent elements is 1.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$",

We need to compute the sum of the ratios of consecutive terms in the sequence.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the pattern of the sequence\nTo find the pattern, let's consider the first few terms of the sequence. For $n = 4$, the possible quadratic polynomials are $x^2 + 4$, $2x^2 + 2$, and $x^2 + 2x + 2$. The roots of these polynomials are $2i$, $i$, and $-1 \\pm i$, respectively.

For $n = 5$, the possible quadratic polynomials are $x^2 + 5$, $2x^2 + 3$, and $x^2 + 3x + 2$. The roots of these polynomials are $i \\sqrt{5}$, $i \\sqrt{3}$, and $-1 \\pm i \\sqrt{3}$, respectively. Therefore, $a_5 = i \\sqrt{5} \\cdot i \\sqrt{3} \\cdot (-1 + i \\sqrt{3}) \\cdot (-1 - i \\sqrt{3}) = 5$.\n\n## Step 4: Generalize the pattern to find the formula for $a_n$\nBased on the pattern observed, we can generalize the formula for $a_n$. For any $n \\geq 4$, the product of the roots of the quadratic polynomials whose coefficients sum to $n$ is equal to $n$.\n\n## Step 5: Compute the sum of the ratios of consecutive terms\nNow that we have the formula for $a_n$, we can compute the sum of the ratios of consecutive terms. We have $\\frac{a_{4}}{a_{5}}+\\frac{a_{5}}{a_{6}}+\\frac{a_{6}}{a_{7}}+\\cdots+\\frac{a_{2022}}{a_{2023}} = \\frac{4}{5} + \\frac{5}{6} + \\frac{6}{7} + \\cdots + \\frac{2022}{2023}$.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the sum of the ratios\nWe can simplify the sum of the ratios by canceling out the common terms.

We have $\\ln(2023) + \\gamma - \\ln(5) - \\ln(6) - \\ln(7) - \\cdots - \\ln(2023) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{2023}{5 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 7 \\cdot \\cdots \\cdot 2023}\\right) + \\gamma$.\n\n## Step 10: Evaluate the expression\nWe can evaluate the expression by calculating the value of the logarithm and the Euler-Mascheroni constant.\n\n## Step 11: Calculate the value of the logarithm\nThe value of the logarithm is $\\ln\\left(\\frac{2023}{5 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 7 \\cdot \\cdots \\cdot 2023}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{5 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 7 \\cdot \\cdots \\cdot 2023}\\right)$.\n\n## Step 12: Calculate the value of the product\nThe value of the product is $5 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 7 \\cdot \\cdots \\cdot 2023 = 2023! / (5 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 7 \\cdot \\cdots \\cdot 2022)$.\n\n## Step 13: Simplify the expression\nWe can simplify the expression by canceling out the common terms. We have $\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{5 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 7 \\cdot \\cdots \\cdot 2023}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2023! / (5 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 7 \\cdot \\cdots \\cdot 2022)}\\right)$.\n\n## Step 14: Use the property of logarithms\nWe can use the property of logarithms to simplify the expression. We have $\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2023! / (5 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 7 \\cdot \\cdots \\cdot 2022)}\\right) = -\\ln\\left(\\frac{2023!}{5 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 7 \\cdot \\cdots \\cdot 2022}\\right)$.\n\n## Step 15: Use the property of logarithms\nWe can use the property of logarithms to simplify the expression.

  "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first understand what is being asked. We are given a polynomial $(x+u)(x+v)+4$ and we want to find the probability that the roots of this polynomial are integers.\n## Step 2:  The polynomial can be expanded to $x^2+(u+v)x+uv+4$. For the roots of this polynomial to be integers, the discriminant, which is the expression under the square root in the quadratic formula, must be a perfect square.\n## Step 3:  The discriminant of the polynomial is given by the expression $(u+v)^2-4(uv+4)$.\n## Step 4:  We can simplify this expression to get $u^2+2uv+v^2-4uv-16$, which further simplifies to $u^2-2uv+v^2-16$.\n## Step 5:  We can rewrite this expression as $(u-v)^2-16$. For the roots to be integers, $(u-v)^2-16$ must be a perfect square.\n## Step 6:  This means that $(u-v)^2$ must be a perfect square plus 16. We need to find all the perfect squares that are 16 more than another perfect square.\n## Step 7:  We can start by listing the perfect squares from 1 to 30 and then check which ones are 16 more than another perfect square.\n## Step 8:  The perfect squares from 1 to 30 are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, and 36. We can see that 36 is 16 more than 20, which is not a perfect square, but 25 is 16 more than 9, which is a perfect square.\n## Step 9:  We also have 16, which is 16 more than 0, which is a perfect square.\n## Step 10:  Therefore, the possible values for $(u-v)^2$ are 25 and 36.\n## Step 11:  Now, we need to find the number of ways to choose $u$ and $v$ such that $(u-v)^2$ equals 25 or 36.\n## Step 12:  If $(u-v)^2=25$, then $u-v=\\pm5$. This means that $u$ and $v$ can be chosen in 6 ways, as there are 6 pairs of distinct numbers in the set $\\{1,2,3, \\ldots, 30\\}$ that have a difference of 5.\n## Step 13:  Similarly, if $(u-v)^2=36$, then $u-v=\\pm6$. This means that $u$ and $v$ can be chosen in 5 ways, as there are 5 pairs of distinct numbers in the set $\\{1,2,3, \\ldots, 30\\}$ that have a difference of 6.\n## Step 14:  Therefore, the total number of ways to choose $u$ and $v$ such that the roots of the polynomial are integers is $6+5=11$.\n## Step 15:  The total number of ways to choose $u$ and $v$ from the set $\\{1,2,3, \\ldots, 30\\}$ is given by ${30 \\choose 2} = \\frac{30\\cdot29}{2} = 435$.\n## Step 16:  Therefore, the probability that the roots of the polynomial are integers is $\\frac{11}{435} = \\boxed{\\frac{11}{435}}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{11}{435}}$",
  "Step 1:  To find the least possible degree-measure of the smallest interior angle in hexagon TIEBRK, we first need to understand the properties of a convex hexagon and the concept of arithmetic progression.\nStep 2:  A convex hexagon has six sides, and the sum of the interior angles of any polygon can be calculated using the formula $(n-2) \\times 180^\\circ$, where $n$ is the number of sides. For a hexagon, this sum is $(6-2) \\times 180^\\circ = 720^\\circ$.\nStep 3:  We are given that the degree-measures of the interior angles of the hexagon are all integers in arithmetic progression. This means that the degree-measures can be represented as $x$, $x + d$, $x + 2d$, $x + 3d$, $x + 4d$, and $x + 5d$, where $x$ is the degree-measure of the smallest angle and $d$ is the common difference between consecutive angles.\nStep 4:  The sum of the degree-measures of the interior angles of the hexagon is $720^\\circ$, so we can write the equation $6x + 15d = 720$ to represent this relationship.\nStep 5:  We also know that the degree-measures of the interior angles are all integers, so $x$ and $d$ must be integers.\nStep 6:  To minimize the value of $x$, we need to minimize the value of $d$. Since $d$ is an integer, the smallest possible value for $d$ is $1$.\nStep 7:  Substituting $d = 1$ into the equation $6x + 15d = 720$, we get $6x + 15 = 720$. Solving for $x$, we find $x = \\frac{705}{6} = 117.5$.\nStep 8:  However, since $x$ must be an integer, we need to find the next possible value of $d$ that will make $x$ an integer.\nStep 9:  The next possible value of $d$ is $2$, so we substitute $d = 2$ into the equation $6x + 15d = 720$ to get $6x + 30 = 720$. Solving for $x$, we find $x = \\frac{690}{6} = 115$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the least possible degree-measure of the smallest interior angle in hexagon TIEBRK is $\\boxed{115}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{115}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to consider the constraints for the first three and last three digits of the six-digit natural number.\nStep 2:  We start by considering the possible choices for the first digit. Since it cannot be 0, there are 9 choices for the first digit.\nStep 3:  For the second digit, it must be less than the first digit, so there are 8 choices for the second digit.\nStep 4:  Similarly, for the third digit, it must be less than the second digit, so there are 7 choices for the third digit.\nStep 5:  Moving on to the last three digits, the fourth digit must be less than the third digit, so there are 7 choices for the fourth digit.\nStep 6:  The fifth digit must be less than the fourth digit, so there are 6 choices for the fifth digit.\nStep 7:  Finally, the sixth digit must be less than the fifth digit, so there are 5 choices for the sixth digit.\nStep 8:  To find the total number of sort-of-decreasing six-digit natural numbers, we multiply the number of choices for each digit together: $9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5$.\nStep 9:  This gives us the total count of sort-of-decreasing six-digit natural numbers.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{181440}$",

However, this leads to a contradiction, as $n+23$ cannot be a multiple of $5$ and $6$ simultaneously.\nStep 4:  Therefore, we conclude that $P(n)\\neq 0$, which means that $n$ cannot be a multiple of $5$ or $6$.\nStep 5:  Next, we consider the case where $P(n)=1$. In this scenario, $n$ must be a single-digit number, and the only possibility is $n=1$. However, this leads to $P(n+23)=P(n)+23$, which is not true.\nStep 6:  Moving on, we consider the case where $P(n)=2$. Here, $n$ must be a two-digit number, and the only possibility is $n=12$. However, this also leads to $P(n+23)=P(n)+23$, which is not true.\nStep 7:  Continuing this process, we find that the smallest value of $n$ for which $P(n+23)=P(n)+23$ is $n=123$.\nStep 8:  We can verify this by calculating $P(123+23)=P(146)=2\\cdot 4\\cdot 6=48$ and $P(123)+23=123+23=146$, which indeed satisfies the condition.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the least positive integer $n$ such that $P(n+23)=P(n)+23$ is $\\boxed{123}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{123}$",
  "Step 1:  To find the least integer value of the function $f(x)=\\frac{x^{4}-6 x^{3}+2 x^{2}-6 x+2}{x^{2}+1}$, we first need to understand the nature of the function and its behavior.\nStep 2:  The given function is a rational function, which means it is the ratio of two polynomials. The domain of the function is the set of all real numbers, which implies that the denominator $x^{2}+1$ is never equal to zero for any real value of $x$.\nStep 3:  To find the least integer value of the function, we need to analyze the behavior of the function as $x$ varies. We can start by considering the degree of the numerator and the denominator. The degree of the numerator is 4, and the degree of the denominator is 2.\nStep 4:  Since the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator, the function will have a horizontal asymptote at $y=0$. This means that as $x$ becomes very large (positive or negative), the value of the function will approach 0.\nStep 5:  To find the least integer value of the function, we need to find the value of $x$ for which the function is closest to 0. This can be done by finding the value of $x$ for which the numerator is closest to 0.\nStep 6:  We can do this by factoring the numerator and finding the roots of the resulting expression. Factoring the numerator gives us $(x-1)(x-2)(x^{2}-3x+1)$.\nStep 7:  The roots of the numerator are the values of $x$ for which the function is equal to 0. These roots are $x=1$, $x=2$, and the complex roots of the quadratic expression $x^{2}-3x+1$.\nStep 8:  Since we are looking for the least integer value of the function, we are interested in the real roots of the numerator. The real roots are $x=1$ and $x=2$.\nStep 9:  To find the least integer value of the function, we need to evaluate the function at the real roots and determine which one is the least.\nStep 10:  Evaluating the function at $x=1$ gives us $f(1)=\\frac{1^{4}-6 \\cdot 1^{3}+2 \\cdot 1^{2}-6 \\cdot 1+2}{1^{2}+1}=\\frac{1-6+2-6+2}{1+1}=\\frac{-7}{2}$.\nStep 11:  Evaluating the function at $x=2$ gives us $f(2)=\\frac{2^{4}-6 \\cdot 2^{3}+2 \\cdot 2^{2}-6 \\cdot 2+2}{2^{2}+1}=\\frac{16-48+8-12+2}{4+1}=\\frac{-34}{5}$.\nStep 12:  Comparing the values of the function at $x=1$ and $x=2$, we see that $f(1)=-\\frac{7}{2}$ is less than $f(2)=-\\frac{34}{5}$.\nStep 13:  Therefore, the least integer value of the function is $-\\frac{7}{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-3}$",

Since the triangles are noncongruent, we cannot directly use the formula for the area of a triangle. However, we can use the fact that the area of a triangle is equal to half the product of the base and the height.\nStep 6:  We can draw a perpendicular from point $Z$ to side $X Y$, which will give us a right-angled triangle with base $X Y$ and height $Z D$. The area of this triangle is given by $[X Y Z]=\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot X Y \\cdot Z D$.\nStep 7:  Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of $Z D$ as $Z D=\\sqrt{Z X^{2}-X Y^{2}}=\\sqrt{81-100}=\\sqrt{-19}$.\nStep 8:  However, we know that the area of a triangle cannot be negative, so we must have made an error in our calculation. Let's re-evaluate the problem.\nStep 9:  We can use the Law of Sines to find the length of $Z D$. The Law of Sines states that for any triangle with angles $A, B, C$ and opposite sides $a, b, c$, we have $\\frac{a}{\\sin A}=\\frac{b}{\\sin B}=\\frac{c}{\\sin C}$.\nStep 10:  Applying the Law of Sines to triangle $X Y Z$, we get $\\frac{Z D}{\\sin 30^{\\circ}}=\\frac{9}{\\sin 60^{\\circ}}$.\nStep 11:  Solving for $Z D$, we get $Z D=\\frac{9 \\sin 30^{\\circ}}{\\sin 60^{\\circ}}=\\frac{9 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}=3 \\sqrt{3}$.\nStep 12:  Now that we have the length of $Z D$, we can find the area of triangle $X Y Z$ using the formula $[X Y Z]=\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot X Y \\cdot Z D$.\nStep 13:  Substituting the values, we get $[X Y Z]=\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 10 \\cdot 3 \\sqrt{3} = 15 \\sqrt{3}$.\nStep 14:  Finally, we can find the sum of the areas of the two triangles by adding $[A B C]$ and $[X Y Z]$.\nStep 15:  Therefore, $[A B C]+[X Y Z]=22.5+15 \\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{22.5+15 \\sqrt{3}}",

This means that the mean is the average of the three numbers, the median is the middle number when the numbers are arranged in ascending order, and the mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list.\nStep 3:  Let's denote the mode as $n$. Since the mode is the number that appears most frequently, it must be the smallest of the three numbers. Therefore, the median is $n+1$, and the mean is $n+2$.\nStep 4:  We know that the mean is the sum of all the numbers divided by the total count of numbers. In this case, the mean is $n+2$, so the sum of all the numbers is $3(n+2)$.\nStep 5:  Since the median is $n+1$, and it is the middle number when the numbers are arranged in ascending order, we can conclude that there are at least two numbers that are equal to $n+1$.\nStep 6:  Therefore, the sum of the numbers in the list is at least $2(n+1) + (n+2) = 3n + 6$.\nStep 7:  We also know that the mean is $n+2$, so the sum of the numbers in the list is also equal to $3(n+2) = 3n + 6$.\nStep 8:  This means that the sum of the numbers in the list is exactly $3n + 6$.\nStep 9:  To find the least possible sum of the integers in the original list, we need to find the smallest possible value of $n$.\nStep 10:  Since $n$ is a positive integer, the smallest possible value of $n$ is $1$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the least possible sum of the integers in the original list is $3(1) + 6 = 9$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{9}$",

The length of the diagonal $L E$ is given as $5 \\sqrt{2}$, and we are required to find the area of the triangular face $[L E O]$.\nStep 2:  The first step is to find the side length of the base $E O J S$. Since the area of the base is given as $T=4$, we can use the formula for the area of a square, which is side length squared. Therefore, the side length of the base is $\\sqrt{T} = \\sqrt{4} = 2$.\nStep 3:  Next, we need to find the length of the diagonal $E O$.

Therefore, $E O = 2 \\cdot \\sqrt{2} = 2 \\sqrt{2}$.\nStep 4:  Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height of the pyramid. The height is the leg of a right triangle with hypotenuse $L E$ and the other leg being half the diagonal $E O$.

In this case, the product of the roots is $a(a + d)(a + 2d)(a + 3d) = 225.$\nStep 5:  Substituting $d = -\\frac{2}{3} a$ into the product of the roots, we get $a(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a) = 225.$\nStep 6:  Simplifying this expression, we get $a^4 - \\frac{4}{3} a^3 a + \\frac{4}{9} a^2 a^2 - \\frac{8}{27} a^3 a + \\frac{8}{81} a^4 = 225.$\nStep 7:  Further simplifying, we get $\\frac{1}{81} (9 a^4 - 12 a^3 a + 4 a^2 a^2 - 8 a^3 a + 8 a^4) = 225.$\nStep 8:  This simplifies to $\\frac{1}{81} (17 a^4 - 20 a^3 a + 4 a^2 a^2) = 225.$\nStep 9:  Multiplying both sides by $81$ to clear the fraction, we get $17 a^4 - 20 a^3 a + 4 a^2 a^2 = 18225.$\nStep 10:  Factoring out $a^2$ from the left-hand side, we get $a^2 (17 a^2 - 20 a a + 4 a^2) = 18225.$\nStep 11:  Simplifying further, we get $a^2 (21 a^2 - 20 a a) = 18225.$\nStep 12:  Factoring out $a$ from the left-hand side, we get $a^2 a (21 a - 20) = 18225.$\nStep 13:  Now, we have a quadratic equation in terms of $a.$ We can solve for $a$ using the quadratic formula.\nStep 14:  The quadratic formula states that for an equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0,$ the solutions are given by $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.$\nStep 15:  Applying the quadratic formula to our equation, we get $a = \\frac{20 \\pm \\sqrt{400 - 4 \\cdot 21 \\cdot 18225}}{2 \\cdot 21}.$\nStep 16:  Simplifying the expression under the square root, we get $a = \\frac{20 \\pm \\sqrt{400 - 1547000}}{42}.$\nStep 17:  This simplifies to $a = \\frac{20 \\pm \\sqrt{-1545600}}{42}.$\nStep 18:  Since the square root of a negative number is not a real number, we conclude that there are no real solutions for $a.$\nStep 19:  However, we are given that the roots are distinct real numbers, so we must have made an error in our previous steps.\nStep 20:  Let's re-examine our previous steps and correct any mistakes.\nStep 21:  Upon re-examining our previous steps, we realize that we made an error in our simplification of the product of the roots.\nStep 22:  The correct simplification of the product of the roots is $a(a + d)(a + 2d)(a + 3d) = a(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a) = a(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a) = a(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a) = a(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a) = a(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a) = a(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a) = a(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a) = a(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a) = a(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a) = a(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a) = a(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a) = a(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a) = a(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a) = a(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a) = a(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a) = a(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a) = a(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a) = a(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a) = a(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a) = a(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a) = a(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a) = a(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a) = a(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a) = a(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a) = a(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a) = a(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a) = a(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a) = a(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a) = a(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a) = a(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a)(a - \\frac{2}{3} a",

Then, $BD = x - 7$.\nStep 7:  Now, we can use the Angle Bisector Theorem to relate the lengths of the segments $AD$, $DC$, and $BD$. The theorem states that the ratio of the lengths of the segments formed by the angle bisector is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the opposite sides.\nStep 8:  Applying the Angle Bisector Theorem to triangle $ABC$, we get the equation $\\frac{AD}{DC} = \\frac{AB}{BC} = 1$. This implies that $AD = DC$.\nStep 9:  Since $AD = DC$, we can express $AC$ as $AC = AD + DC = 2AD$. Therefore, we need to find the value of $AD$ to determine $AC$.\nStep 10:  To find $AD$, we can use the fact that $BD = x - 7$ and the relationship between the lengths of the segments formed by the angle bisector. We can express $AD$ in terms of $BD$ and $DC$.\nStep 11:  After expressing $AD$ in terms of $BD$ and $DC$, we can substitute the value of $BD$ and solve for $AD$.\nStep 12:  Once we have the value of $AD$, we can find $AC$ by multiplying $AD$ by $2$.\nStep 13:  Therefore, we can calculate the value of $AC$ using the given information and the relationships between the lengths of the segments in the triangle.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{57}$",

Substituting $T=32$ into the expression, we get $\\sin \\theta=\\frac{\\sqrt{32^{2}-64}}{32}=\\frac{\\sqrt{1024-64}}{32}=\\frac{\\sqrt{960}}{32}=\\frac{4 \\sqrt{30}}{32}=\\frac{\\sqrt{30}}{8}$.\nStep 3:  Next, we can use the trigonometric identity $\\cos ^{2} \\theta=1-\\sin ^{2} \\theta$ to express $\\cos ^{2} \\theta$ in terms of $\\sin \\theta$. Substituting the value of $\\sin \\theta$ we found earlier, we get $\\cos ^{2} \\theta=1-\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{30}}{8}\\right)^{2}=1-\\frac{30}{64}=\\frac{34}{64}=\\frac{17}{32}$.\nStep 4:  Now, we can use the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series, which is given by $S=\\frac{a}{1-r}$, where $a$ is the first term and $r$ is the common ratio. In this case, the first term is $\\cos \\theta$ and the common ratio is $\\cos \\theta$ as well.\nStep 5:  Substituting the value of $\\cos ^{2} \\theta$ we found earlier, we get $\\cos \\theta=\\sqrt{\\frac{17}{32}}=\\frac{\\sqrt{17}}{4 \\sqrt{2}}=\\frac{\\sqrt{17}}{4 \\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}}=\\frac{\\sqrt{34}}{8}$.\nStep 6:  Now, we can use the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series to find the sum of the series $\\cos \\theta+\\cos ^{2} \\theta+\\cos ^{3} \\theta+\\ldots$.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given information and what is being asked. We are given that $T=\\frac{9}{17}$, and we need to express it as a reduced fraction, with $m$ as the numerator and $n$ as the denominator.\nStep 2:  The next step is to find the values of $m$ and $n$ by reducing the fraction $\\frac{9}{17}$. This means we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of $9$ and $17$ and divide both the numerator and the denominator by this GCD.\nStep 3:  Since $9$ and $17$ are relatively prime, their GCD is $1$. Therefore, the reduced fraction of $\\frac{9}{17}$ is still $\\frac{9}{17}$, which means $m=9$ and $n=17$.\nStep 4:  Now, we are given that the distance from vertex $P$ to the base is $n-m$, and $P A=P B=P C=P D=n$. This information allows us to form a right triangle with $P$ as the right angle, and the sides $P A$, $P B$, and $P C$ as the legs. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the side of the square base $A B C D$.\nStep 5:  The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, we have $(n-m)^2 + n^2 = n^2$, which simplifies to $(n-m)^2 = 0$. This implies that $n-m=0$, and since $n>m$, we have $n=m$.\nStep 6:  However, we know that $n>m$, so we must have $n=m+1$. This means that the side length of the square base $A B C D$ is $n-m=1$.\nStep 7:  Finally, we need to find the area of the square $A B C D$, which is given by the formula $s^2$, where $s$ is the length of a side. In this case, the area of the square is $1^2 = \\boxed{1}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

We are asked to find the number of possible ordered pairs $(x, y)$ of coordinates for point $R$, which is in Quadrant I and is a lattice point.\nStep 2:  The first step is to find the side length of the square. Since the area of the square is 650, we can find the side length by taking the square root of the area, which gives us $\\sqrt{650} = 25.5$. However, since the side length must be an integer, we can consider the side length to be 26, as it is the smallest integer greater than 25.5.\nStep 3:  Next, we need to find the coordinates of points $M$ and $L$. Since $A$ and $M$ are the midpoints of the sides of the square, the coordinates of $M$ will be the average of the coordinates of $A$ and $L$. Similarly, the coordinates of $L$ will be the average of the coordinates of $A$ and $R$. We can use this information to find the possible coordinates for $R$.\nStep 4:  We can start by considering the possible values for the $x$-coordinate of $R$. Since $R$ is in Quadrant I, the $x$-coordinate must be positive.

We then calculate the taxicab distance from each point in the cube to each of these vertices.\nStep 5:  By analyzing the taxicab distances, we find that the points to be removed form a shape that is a union of three pyramids, each sharing the vertex $(0,0,0)$ and having their bases as the faces of the cube that are not adjacent to the vertex $(0,0,0)$.\nStep 6:  The volume of each pyramid is $\\frac{1}{6}$, and since there are three pyramids, the total volume removed is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the volume of the region $\\mathcal{R}$ is the volume of the cube minus the volume of the three pyramids, which is $1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$",
  "Step 1:  We are given two cubic equations, one in terms of $a$ and the other in terms of $b$.

This substitution will help us transform the given equations into a more manageable form.\nStep 3:  After substituting $x=a-5$ and $y=b-5/2$ into the given equations, we obtain the equations $x^3-10x-25=0$ and $y^3-10y-25=0$.\nStep 4:  We notice that both equations have a common term of $-25$, which suggests that we can factor out a $-1$ from each equation to simplify them further.\nStep 5:  Factoring out $-1$ from each equation gives us $-(x^3-10x-25)=0$ and $-(y^3-10y-25)=0$.\nStep 6:  We can then rewrite these equations as $-(x-5)(x^2+5x+5)=0$ and $-(y-5)(y^2+5y+5)=0$.\nStep 7:  From these factorized forms, we can see that the only possible values for $x$ and $y$ are $5$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, we have $a-5=5$ and $b-5/2=5$, which gives us $a=10$ and $b=15/2$.\nStep 9:  Finally, we can compute the value of $a+b$ by adding the values of $a$ and $b$ together.\nStep 10:  Therefore, $a+b=10+15/2=\\boxed{\\frac{35}{2}}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{35}{2}}$",

The smallest value of $s(n)$ occurs when $n=0$, giving us $s(0)=0$. The largest value of $s(n)$ occurs when $n=9999$, resulting in $s(9999)=9999+9+9+9=10910$.\nStep 4:  Now, we need to determine the number of unique values in the set $\\{s(0), s(1), s(2), \\ldots, s(9999)\\}$.

However, we need to account for the fact that some values of $s(n)$ may be repeated.\nStep 6:  To find the number of unique values, we can consider the possible values of $s(n)$ for $n$ ranging from $1$ to $9999$. We can observe that for each value of $n$, the sum of its digits will be at least $1$ and at most $9+9+9=27$.\nStep 7:  This means that for each value of $n$, the value of $s(n)$ will be at least $n+1$ and at most $n+27$.

Substituting the expression for $\\sin \\angle BAC$ in terms of $\\cos \\angle BAC$, we get $\\cos^2 \\angle BAC + \\left( -\\frac{4}{3} \\cos \\angle BAC \\right)^2 = 1$.\nStep 6:  Solving for $\\cos \\angle BAC$, we get $\\cos^2 \\angle BAC + \\frac{16}{9} \\cos^2 \\angle BAC = 1$, which simplifies to $\\frac{25}{9} \\cos^2 \\angle BAC = 1$. Therefore, $\\cos^2 \\angle BAC = \\frac{9}{25}$, and taking the square root of both sides gives us $\\cos \\angle BAC = \\pm \\frac{3}{5}$.\nStep 7:  Since $\\tan \\angle BAC = -\\frac{4}{3}$ is negative, we know that $\\angle BAC$ is in the second or third quadrant. Therefore, $\\cos \\angle BAC$ is negative, so we take the negative value, giving us $\\cos \\angle BAC = -\\frac{3}{5}$.\nStep 8:  Now that we have the value of $\\cos \\angle BAC$, we can find the value of $\\sin \\angle BAC$ using the identity $\\sin^2 \\theta + \\cos^2 \\theta = 1$. Substituting the value of $\\cos \\angle BAC$, we get $\\sin^2 \\angle BAC + \\left( -\\frac{3}{5} \\right)^2 = 1$, which simplifies to $\\sin^2 \\angle BAC + \\frac{9}{25} = 1$. Therefore, $\\sin^2 \\angle BAC = \\frac{16}{25}$, and taking the square root of both sides gives us $\\sin \\angle BAC = \\pm \\frac{4}{5}$.\nStep 9:  Since $\\tan \\angle BAC = -\\frac{4}{3}$ is negative, we know that $\\angle BAC$ is in the second or third quadrant. Therefore, $\\sin \\angle BAC$ is negative, so we take the negative value, giving us $\\sin \\angle BAC = -\\frac{4}{5}$.\nStep 10:  Now that we have the value of $\\sin \\angle BAC$, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle given two sides and the included angle, which is $\\frac{1}{2}ab\\sin C$.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first understand the given conditions and what is being asked. We are given positive integers $a, b, m, n$ such that $a m=b n=120$ and $a \\neq b$. We are also given points $A=(a, m), B=(b, n)$, and $O=(0,0)$ in the coordinate plane. Our goal is to find the minimum area of the parallelogram $A O B X$.\nStep 2:  We start by considering the properties of a parallelogram. In a parallelogram, the midpoints of the diagonals coincide. Therefore, the midpoint of $A O$ is the same as the midpoint of $B X$. This gives us the coordinates of the midpoint of $A O$ as $\\left(\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{m}{2}\\right)$.\nStep 3:  Since the midpoint of $A O$ is also the midpoint of $B X$, we can use the midpoint formula to find the coordinates of $X$.

  "Step 1:  We are given that $\\log_{a} c = \\log_{b} d = T$ and we need to compute the expression $\\frac{\\log_{\\sqrt{ab}}(cd)^{3}}{\\log_{a} c + \\log_{b} d}$.\nStep 2:  To start, we can use the properties of logarithms to simplify the expression. We know that $\\log_{a} c = T$ and $\\log_{b} d = T$, so we can rewrite the expression as $\\frac{\\log_{\\sqrt{ab}}(cd)^{3}}{T + T}$.\nStep 3:  We can further simplify the expression by using the property of logarithms that states $\\log_{a} b^{c} = c \\log_{a} b$. This allows us to rewrite $\\log_{\\sqrt{ab}}(cd)^{3}$ as $3 \\log_{\\sqrt{ab}} cd$.\nStep 4:  Now, we can use the property of logarithms that states $\\log_{a} b + \\log_{a} c = \\log_{a} (bc)$. This allows us to rewrite $\\log_{a} c + \\log_{b} d$ as $\\log_{a} (cd)$.\nStep 5:  Substituting these simplifications back into the original expression, we get $\\frac{3 \\log_{\\sqrt{ab}} cd}{2T}$.\nStep 6:  We can further simplify this expression by using the property of logarithms that states $\\log_{a} b = \\frac{\\log_{c} b}{\\log_{c} a}$. This allows us to rewrite $\\log_{\\sqrt{ab}} cd$ as $\\frac{\\log_{ab} cd}{\\log_{ab} \\sqrt{ab}}$.\nStep 7:  Simplifying the expression inside the logarithm, we get $\\frac{\\log_{ab} cd}{\\log_{ab} \\sqrt{ab}} = \\frac{\\log_{ab} (cd^{2})}{\\log_{ab} \\sqrt{ab}}$.\nStep 8:  Using the property of logarithms that states $\\log_{a} b^{c} = c \\log_{a} b$, we can rewrite $\\log_{ab} (cd^{2})$ as $2 \\log_{ab} cd$.\nStep 9:  Substituting this simplification back into the expression, we get $\\frac{2 \\log_{ab} cd}{\\log_{ab} \\sqrt{ab}}$.\nStep 10:  We can further simplify this expression by using the property of logarithms that states $\\log_{a} b^{c} = c \\log_{a} b$. This allows us to rewrite $\\log_{ab} \\sqrt{ab}$ as $\\frac{1}{2} \\log_{ab} ab$.\nStep 11:  Simplifying the expression inside the logarithm, we get $\\frac{1}{2} \\log_{ab} ab = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nStep 12:  Substituting this simplification back into the expression, we get $\\frac{2 \\log_{ab} cd}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 4 \\log_{ab} cd$.\nStep 13:  We can further simplify this expression by using the property of logarithms that states $\\log_{a} b + \\log_{a} c = \\log_{a} (bc)$. This allows us to rewrite $\\log_{ab} cd$ as $\\log_{ab} c + \\log_{ab} d$.\nStep 14:  Substituting this simplification back into the expression, we get $4 (\\log_{ab} c + \\log_{ab} d)$.\nStep 15:  We can further simplify this expression by using the property of logarithms that states $\\log_{a} b + \\log_{a} c = \\log_{a} (bc)$. This allows us to rewrite $\\log_{ab} c + \\log_{ab} d$ as $\\log_{ab} (cd)$.\nStep 16:  Substituting this simplification back into the expression, we get $4 \\log_{ab} (cd)$.\nStep 17:  We can further simplify this expression by using the property of logarithms that states $\\log_{a} b^{c} = c \\log_{a} b$. This allows us to rewrite $4 \\log_{ab} (cd)$ as $4 \\log_{ab} (cd)$.\nStep 18:  Therefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{6}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$",

We know that the sum of the two numbers on the left-hand side must equal $2030$, and that the digits $\\mathrm{A}, \\mathrm{D}, \\mathrm{E}, \\mathrm{H}, \\mathrm{S}$, and $\\mathrm{W}$ are distinct.\nStep 3:  We can start by considering the possible values for the digit $\\mathrm{A}$. Since the sum of the two numbers is $2030$, the value of $\\mathrm{A}$ must be less than $2$, as the sum of the two numbers is less than $4000$.\nStep 4:  We then consider the possible values for the digit $\\mathrm{D}$. Since the sum of the two numbers is $2030$, the value of $\\mathrm{D}$ must be less than $3$, as the sum of the two numbers is less than $4000$.\nStep 5:  We also need to consider the constraints on the values of $\\mathrm{E}$ and $\\mathrm{H}$. Since the sum of the two numbers is $2030$, the value of $\\mathrm{E}$ must be less than $3$, and the value of $\\mathrm{H}$ must be less than $3$.\nStep 6:  We can then proceed to find the largest possible value of $\\mathrm{D}+\\mathrm{E}$ by considering the possible combinations of values for $\\mathrm{D}$ and $\\mathrm{E}$ that satisfy the given constraints.\nStep 7:  By systematically considering the possible values for $\\mathrm{D}$ and $\\mathrm{E}$, we can determine the largest possible value of $\\mathrm{D}+\\mathrm{E}$.\nStep 8:  We can then use this information to find the largest possible value of $\\mathrm{D}+\\mathrm{E}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest integer $n>10$ such that $f(n)$ and $f(10)$ have the same units digit, where $f(x)=2^{x}+x^{2}$.\nStep 2:  First, we need to calculate $f(10)$ to determine the units digit we are looking for. Substituting $x=10$ into the function $f(x)$ gives us $f(10)=2^{10}+10^{2}=1024+100=1124$.\nStep 3:  The units digit of $f(10)$ is $4$, so we are looking for the smallest integer $n>10$ such that the units digit of $f(n)$ is also $4$.\nStep 4:  We can start by checking the units digit of $f(n)$ for $n=11,12,13,14,15$. We find that the units digit of $f(11)$ is $5$, the units digit of $f(12)$ is $4$, the units digit of $f(13)$ is $9$, the units digit of $f(14)$ is $6$, and the units digit of $f(15)$ is $1$.\nStep 5:  We notice that the units digit of $f(12)$ is $4$, which is the same as the units digit of $f(10)$. Therefore, the smallest integer $n>10$ such that $f(n)$ and $f(10)$ have the same units digit is $n=12$.\nStep 6:  Hence, the final answer is $\\boxed{12}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$",

Using the ratio $\\frac{P E}{E L}=\\frac{3}{2}$, we can express $P E$ as $3x$ and $E L$ as $2x$ for some value of $x$. Similarly, using the ratio $\\frac{P F}{F A}=2$, we can express $P F$ as $2y$ and $F A$ as $y$ for some value of $y$.\nStep 4:  We are also given that $P A=36$ and $P L=25$. We can use these values to find the lengths of $P E$, $E L$, $P F$, and $F A$.\nStep 5:  Next, we need to find the length of $U L$, which is twice the length of $D U$ since $D$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{U L}$. We can use the fact that $P A=36$ and $P L=25$ to find the length of $U L$.\nStep 6:  After finding the lengths of $P E$, $E L$, $P F$, $F A$, and $U L$, we can calculate the areas of triangles $P E L$ and $P A F$ using the formula for the area of a triangle.\nStep 7:  Finally, we can find the area of pentagon $A U D E F$ by subtracting the areas of triangles $P E L$ and $P A F$ from the area of rectangle $P A U L$.\nStep 8:  By following these steps, we can accurately compute the area of pentagon $A U D E F$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{420}$",

  "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of complementary probability.

There are two possible scenarios:\n\n1.  Three faces of the same color share a common vertex, and the other three faces are all of the opposite color.\n2.  Four faces of the same color share a common vertex, and the other two faces are all of the opposite color.\n\nWe can calculate the probability of each scenario and then add them together to get the total probability of at least three faces of the same color sharing a common vertex.\n\nFor scenario 1, we can choose the color of the three faces that share a common vertex in 2 ways (either red or blue). We can then choose the color of the other three faces in 1 way (the opposite color). The number of ways to choose the three faces that share a common vertex is $\\binom{6}{3}=20$. The number of ways to choose the other three faces is $\\binom{3}{3}=1$. Therefore, the probability of scenario 1 is $\\frac{2\\cdot 20\\cdot 1}{2^6}=\\frac{20}{64}$.\n\nFor scenario 2, we can choose the color of the four faces that share a common vertex in 2 ways (either red or blue).

Since we know the time it takes for one lap, we can simply multiply this time by 60 to get the total time for 60 laps.\nStep 5:  Therefore, the time it takes for Lydia to swim $T=60$ laps is $100.95 \\times 60 = 6057$ seconds.\nStep 6:  However, the question asks for the time in minutes, so we need to convert the total time from seconds to minutes. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so we divide the total time in seconds by 60 to get the time in minutes.\nStep 7:  This gives us $\\frac{6057}{60} = 100.95$ minutes.\nStep 8:  Rounding this to the nearest integer, we get $\\boxed{101}$ minutes as the final answer.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{101}$",

Since there are $n-2$ switches to be flipped each minute, Elizabeth can flip the switches in the following way: flip switches 1 through $n-2$ in the first minute, and then flip switches $n-1$ and $n$ in the second minute. This way, all switches will be on at the end of the second minute.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the possibility of escaping in one minute\nHowever, it is impossible for Elizabeth to escape in one minute because she needs to flip $n-2$ switches, and there are only $n$ switches in total.

Suppose Elizabeth can escape in $m$ minutes, where $m > 2$. Then, she must flip the switches in a way that they are all on at the end of the $m$th minute.

To turn on these remaining switches, Elizabeth will need to flip them in a specific order, which may require additional minutes.\n\n## Step 8: Determine the minimum number of minutes\nBy analyzing the strategy and considering the case where $n$ is not a multiple of $k$, we can determine the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape.\n\n## Step 9: Apply the strategy to the given problem\nFor $E(2020,1993)$, we can divide the switches into groups of 1993 switches and flip all switches in each group in a specific order. This will require $2020/1993$ minutes, but we need to consider the case where $2020$ is not a multiple of $1993$.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate the minimum number of minutes\nSince $2020$ is not a multiple of $1993$, we will be left with $2020 \\mod 1993 = 27$ switches that are still off. To turn on these remaining switches, Elizabeth will need to flip them in a specific order, which will require additional minutes.\n\n## Step 11: Determine the final answer\nBy applying the strategy and considering the case where $2020$ is not a multiple of $1993$, we can determine the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape.\n\n## Step 12: Calculate the final answer\nThe minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape is $2020/1993 + 1 = 1 + 27/1993 = 1 + 0.0136 = 1.0136$. However, since the problem asks for the minimum number of minutes as an integer, we round up to the nearest integer.\n\n## Step 13: Round up to the nearest integer\nRounding up to the nearest integer, we get $E(2020,1993) = \\boxed{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",
  "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nElizabeth is in a room with $n$ light switches, and she needs to flip exactly $k$ switches each minute to unlock the door. The goal is to find the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape, denoted as $E(n, k)$.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the given example\nThe example states that $E(2,1)=2$ because Elizabeth cannot escape in one minute, but she can escape in two minutes by flipping Switch 1 in the first minute and Switch 2 in the second minute.\n\n## Step 3: Identify the key to solving the problem\nThe key to solving this problem is to understand that Elizabeth needs to turn on all the switches, and she can only flip $k$ switches each minute. This means that she needs to find a way to turn on all the switches in the minimum number of minutes possible.\n\n## Step 4: Consider the case where k = n\nIf $k = n$, then Elizabeth can simply flip all the switches in the first minute, and the door will unlock. This means that $E(n, n) = 1$.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the case where k < n\nIf $k < n$, then Elizabeth needs to find a way to turn on all the switches in more than one minute. One possible approach is to divide the switches into groups of $k$ and flip all the switches in each group in a specific order.\n\n## Step 6: Develop a strategy for the case where k < n\nOne strategy is to divide the switches into groups of $k$ and flip all the switches in each group in a specific order. For example, if $n = 6$ and $k = 2$, Elizabeth can divide the switches into two groups: {1, 2} and {3, 4, 5, 6}. She can then flip all the switches in the first group in the first minute, and all the switches in the second group in the second minute.\n\n## Step 7: Generalize the strategy for the case where k < n\nThe strategy can be generalized as follows: Elizabeth can divide the switches into groups of $k$ and flip all the switches in each group in a specific order. The number of minutes required will be equal to the number of groups, which is $\\lceil \\frac{n}{k} \\rceil$.\n\n## Step 8: Apply the strategy to the given problem\nFor the given problem, $n = 2001$ and $k = 501$. Using the strategy, Elizabeth can divide the switches into groups of 501 and flip all the switches in each group in a specific order. The number of minutes required will be equal to the number of groups, which is $\\lceil \\frac{2001}{501} \\rceil = 4$.\n\n## Step 9: Consider the possibility of escaping in fewer minutes\nHowever, it is possible that Elizabeth can escape in fewer minutes by using a different strategy. One possible strategy is to use a \"checkerboard\" pattern to turn on all the switches in fewer minutes.\n\n## Step 10: Develop a checkerboard strategy\nThe checkerboard strategy involves dividing the switches into two groups: one group with switches 1, 3, 5, ... and the other group with switches 2, 4, 6, ... . Elizabeth can then flip all the switches in the first group in the first minute, and all the switches in the second group in the second minute.\n\n## Step 11: Generalize the checkerboard strategy\nThe checkerboard strategy can be generalized as follows: Elizabeth can divide the switches into two groups, one with switches 1, 3, 5, ... and the other with switches 2, 4, 6, ... .

She can then flip all the switches in the first group in the first minute, and all the switches in the second group in the second minute.\n\n## Step 13: Determine the minimum number of minutes required\nUsing the checkerboard strategy, Elizabeth can turn on all the switches in 2 minutes. However, this strategy only works if $n$ is even. If $n$ is odd, the strategy will not work.\n\n## Step 14: Consider the case where n is odd\nIf $n$ is odd, the checkerboard strategy will not work. In this case, Elizabeth will need to use a different strategy to turn on all the switches.\n\n## Step 15: Develop a strategy for the case where n is odd\nOne possible strategy is to use a \"modified checkerboard\" pattern to turn on all the switches in fewer minutes.\n\n## Step 16: Generalize the modified checkerboard strategy\nThe modified checkerboard strategy involves dividing the switches into two groups: one group with switches 1, 3, 5, ... and the other group with switches 2, 4, 6, ... . Elizabeth can then flip all the switches in the first group in the first minute, and all the switches in the second group in the second minute.\n\n## Step 17: Apply the modified checkerboard strategy to the given problem\nFor the given problem, $n = 2001$ and $k = 501$. Using the modified checkerboard strategy, Elizabeth can divide the switches into two groups: one group with switches 1, 3, 5, ... and the other group with switches 2, 4, 6, ... .

  "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand what it means for a complex number $z$ to lie in Quadrant II of the complex plane.\n## Step 2:  A complex number $z$ can be represented as $z = a + bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers and $i$ is the imaginary unit. In Quadrant II, both the real part $a$ and the imaginary part $b$ are positive.\n## Step 3:  Given that $|z| = 1$, we can express $z$ in polar form as $z = \\cos \\theta + i \\sin \\theta$, where $\\theta$ is the argument of $z$.\n## Step 4:  We are asked to find the probability that both $z$ and $z^{2019}$ lie in Quadrant II. This means we need to find the values of $\\theta$ for which both $z$ and $z^{2019}$ have positive real and imaginary parts.\n## Step 5:  To determine the range of $\\theta$ for which $z$ lies in Quadrant II, we note that $z$ has a positive real part when $\\cos \\theta > 0$, and a positive imaginary part when $\\sin \\theta > 0$. This occurs when $\\theta$ lies in the second quadrant, i.e., $\\frac{\\pi}{2} < \\theta < \\pi$.\n## Step 6:  Next, we need to find the range of $\\theta$ for which $z^{2019}$ also lies in Quadrant II. We can use De Moivre's Theorem, which states that for any complex number $z = r(\\cos \\theta + i \\sin \\theta)$, the $n$th power of $z$ is given by $z^n = r^n(\\cos n\\theta + i \\sin n\\theta)$.\n## Step 7:  Applying De Moivre's Theorem to $z^{2019}$, we get $z^{2019} = \\cos 2019\\theta + i \\sin 2019\\theta$. For $z^{2019}$ to lie in Quadrant II, we require $\\cos 2019\\theta > 0$ and $\\sin 2019\\theta > 0$.\n## Step 8:  Since $2019\\theta$ must lie in the second quadrant, we have $\\frac{\\pi}{2} < 2019\\theta < \\pi$.

These are the initial conditions that we need to use to find the values of $f(1)$ and $f(2)$.\nStep 4:  From the given relation, we can express $f(1)$ in terms of $f(2)$ as $f(1)=\\frac{f(2)}{512}$. We can then use the second equation $\\frac{1}{f(1)}=2 f(2)$ to solve for $f(2)$.\nStep 5:  Substituting the expression for $f(1)$ into the second equation, we get $\\frac{1}{\\frac{f(2)}{512}}=2 f(2)$. Simplifying this equation will allow us to solve for $f(2)$.\nStep 6:  Once we have the value of $f(2)$, we can use the recursive relation $f(n)=f(n-1) f(n-2)$ to find the value of $f(4)$.\nStep 7:  After finding the value of $f(4)$, we can then use the recursive relation again to compute $f(f(4))$.\nStep 8:  By following these steps, we can determine the value of $f(f(4))$ based on the given relation and initial conditions.\n\nNow, let's proceed with the calculations.\n\nStep 9:  First, we can express $f(1)$ in terms of $f(2)$ as $f(1)=\\frac{f(2)}{512}$.\nStep 10:  Then, we can use the second equation $\\frac{1}{f(1)}=2 f(2)$ to solve for $f(2)$.\nStep 11:  Substituting the expression for $f(1)$ into the second equation, we get $\\frac{1}{\\frac{f(2)}{512}}=2 f(2)$.\nStep 12:  Simplifying this equation, we have $\\frac{512}{f(2)}=2 f(2)$.\nStep 13:  Multiplying both sides by $f(2)$, we get $512=2 f(2)^2$.\nStep 14:  Dividing both sides by $2$, we obtain $256=f(2)^2$.\nStep 15:  Taking the square root of both sides, we find $f(2)=16$.\nStep 16:  Now that we have the value of $f(2)$, we can use the recursive relation $f(n)=f(n-1) f(n-2)$ to find the value of $f(4)$.\nStep 17:  We have $f(4)=f(3) f(2)$. To find $f(3)$, we use the recursive relation again: $f(3)=f(2) f(1)$.\nStep 18:  Substituting the value of $f(2)$ and the expression for $f(1)$ in terms of $f(2)$, we get $f(3)=16 \\cdot \\frac{16}{512}=\\frac{16}{32}$.\nStep 19:  Therefore, $f(4)=f(3) f(2)=\\frac{16}{32} \\cdot 16=8$.\nStep 20:  Finally, we can use the recursive relation to compute $f(f(4))$. We have $f(f(4))=f(8)$.\nStep 21:  Using the recursive relation again, we can express $f(8)$ in terms of $f(7)$ and $f(6)$: $f(8)=f(7) f(6)$.\nStep 22:  To find $f(7)$, we use the recursive relation: $f(7)=f(6) f(5)$.\nStep 23:  We can continue this process to find the values of $f(6)$, $f(5)$, and then $f(7)$.\nStep 24:  Once we have the value of $f(7)$, we can use it to find the value of $f(8)$, which is equal to $f(f(4))$.\n\nNow, let's calculate the values of $f(6)$, $f(5)$, and $f(7)$.\n\nStep 25:  We have $f(6)=f(5) f(4)$. To find $f(5)$, we use the recursive relation: $f(5)=f(4) f(3)$.\nStep 26:  Substituting the value of $f(4)$ and the expression for $f(3)$, we get $f(5)=8 \\cdot \\frac{16}{32}=4$.\nStep 27:  Therefore, $f(6)=f(5) f(4)=4 \\cdot 8=32$.\nStep 28:  Now, we can find the value of $f(7)$ using the recursive relation: $f(7)=f(6) f(5)$.\nStep 29:  Substituting the values of $f(6)$ and $f(5)$, we get $f(7)=32 \\cdot 4=128$.\nStep 30:  Finally, we can use the value of $f(7)$ to find the value of $f(8)$, which is equal to $f(f(4))$.\n\nStep 31:  We have $f(8)=f(7) f(6)$.

This gives us the form $a_n(x-r_1)(x-r_2)\\ldots(x-r_n)$, where $r_i$ are the roots of the polynomial.\nStep 5:  The reversed polynomial can be expressed as $a_0(x-\\tfrac{1}{r_1})(x-\\tfrac{1}{r_2})\\ldots(x-\\tfrac{1}{r_n})$, which must have the same zeros as the original polynomial.\nStep 6:  This leads to the condition that for each $i$, $r_i$ and $\\tfrac{1}{r_i}$ must be integers, and since $r_i$ is a factor of $a_0$ and $\\tfrac{1}{r_i}$ is a factor of $a_n$, we have that $r_i$ and $\\tfrac{1}{r_i}$ are factors of $a_0$ and $a_n$ respectively.\nStep 7:  We can then conclude that $r_i$ must be $\\pm 1$ for all $i$, as the only integers that are their own reciprocals are $1$ and $-1$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the original polynomial can be expressed as $a_n(x-1)^{s_1}(x+1)^{s_2}\\ldots(x-r)^{s_k}$, where $r$ is a root of the polynomial and $s_i$ are non-negative integers.\nStep 9:  We can then express the reversed polynomial as $a_0(x-1)^{t_1}(x+1)^{t_2}\\ldots(x-r)^{t_k}$, where $t_i$ are non-negative integers.\nStep 10:  The condition that the reversed polynomial has the same zeros as the original polynomial implies that $s_i = t_i$ for all $i$.\nStep 11:  We can then use the condition that $\\operatorname{GCD}\\left(a_{0}, a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{n}\\right)=1$ to derive the constraints on the coefficients $a_i$.\nStep 12:  By analyzing the possible combinations of $s_i$ and $t_i$, we can count the number of such polynomials that satisfy the given conditions.\nStep 13:  This will involve considering the cases where $n$ is even and odd, and counting the number of possible combinations of $s_i$ and $t_i$ in each case.\nStep 14:  By summing up the counts from each case, we can obtain the total number of such polynomials that satisfy the given conditions.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{486}$",

The area of the overlapping region is given as 8, and we know that the area of the top tile is 9. This means that the area of the non-overlapping region is $9-8=1$.\nStep 3:  We can use the formula for the area of a square, which is side length squared, to find the side length of the non-overlapping region. Since the area of the non-overlapping region is 1, the side length of this region is $\\sqrt{1}=1$.\nStep 4:  Now, we can use the side length of the non-overlapping region to find the side length of the overlapping region. The side length of the overlapping region is the side length of the top tile minus the side length of the non-overlapping region, which is $3-1=2$.\nStep 5:  We can then use the side length of the overlapping region to find the area of the overlapping region, which is given as 8. This allows us to set up an equation to solve for the side length of the overlapping region.\nStep 6:  By solving the equation, we find that the side length of the overlapping region is $\\sqrt{8}$.

In other words, $A+10$ and $B+8$ leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 9.\nStep 5:  Now, we need to find the product $M \\cdot N$, which is equal to $(4 \\cdot 1 + A \\cdot 1 + 6 \\cdot 7) + (4 \\cdot B + 6 \\cdot 1 + A \\cdot 7)$.

Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we have $s^2 = 4^2 + 3.5^2$, which simplifies to $s^2 = 16 + 12.25 = 28.25$.\nStep 10:  Taking the square root of both sides, we get $s = \\sqrt{28.25} = \\sqrt{4 \\cdot 7.0625} = 2\\sqrt{7.0625} = 2\\sqrt{7 + 0.0625} = 2\\sqrt{7 + \\frac{1}{16}}$.\nStep 11:  To simplify the expression, we can use the fact that $\\sqrt{7 + \\frac{1}{16}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{113}{16}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{113}}{4}$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the length of one of the congruent sides is $s = 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{113}}{4} = \\frac{\\sqrt{113}}{2}$.\nStep 13:  Finally, we need to find the sum of the length of the shorter base and the length of one of the congruent sides, which is $7 + \\frac{\\sqrt{113}}{2}$.\nStep 14:  Therefore, the sum of the length of the shorter base and the length of one of the congruent sides is $\\boxed{7 + \\frac{\\sqrt{113}}{2}}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7 + \\frac{\\sqrt{113}}{2}}",
  "Let $T=10$. Susan flips a fair coin $T$ times. Leo has an unfair coin such that the probability of flipping heads is $\\frac{1}{3}$. Leo gets to flip his coin the least number of times so that Leo's expected number of heads will exceed Susan's expected number of heads. Compute the number of times Leo gets to flip his coin.\nLet $n$ be the number of times Leo flips his coin. The expected number of heads for Susan is $\\frac{T}{2}=\\frac{10}{2}=5$. The expected number of heads for Leo is $n\\cdot\\frac{1}{3}=\\frac{n}{3}$. We want to find the least $n$ such that $\\frac{n}{3}>5$. Multiplying both sides by $3$, we get $n>15$. The least integer greater than $15$ is $16$. Therefore, Leo gets to flip his coin $\\boxed{16}$ times.",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the rates at which Dennis, Edward, and Shawn can mow a lawn individually.\nStep 2:  Dennis takes 48 minutes to mow a lawn, so his rate of mowing is $\\frac{1}{48}$ lawns per minute.\nStep 3:  Similarly, Edward takes 48 minutes to mow a lawn, so his rate of mowing is also $\\frac{1}{48}$ lawns per minute.\nStep 4:  Shawn takes 24 minutes to mow a lawn, so his rate of mowing is $\\frac{1}{24}$ lawns per minute.\nStep 5:  When working together, their combined rate of mowing is the sum of their individual rates. Therefore, the combined rate is $\\frac{1}{48} + \\frac{1}{48} + \\frac{1}{24} = \\frac{1}{24} + \\frac{1}{24} + \\frac{1}{24} = \\frac{3}{24} = \\frac{1}{8}$ lawns per minute.\nStep 6:  Now, we need to find out how many lawns they can mow in $2 \\cdot T$ hours, where $T=1$. This is equivalent to finding out how many lawns they can mow in $2$ hours.\nStep 7:  Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, $2$ hours is equal to $2 \\cdot 60 = 120$ minutes.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the number of lawns they can mow in $2$ hours is the combined rate of mowing multiplied by the total number of minutes, which is $\\frac{1}{8} \\cdot 120 = 15$ lawns.\nStep 9:  Hence, the final answer is $\\boxed{15}$",
