  "Problem: Each of the two Magellan telescopes has a diameter of $6.5 \\mathrm{~m}$. In one configuration the effective focal length is $72 \\mathrm{~m}$. Find the diameter of the image of a planet (in $\\mathrm{cm}$ ) at this focus if the angular diameter of the planet at the time of the observation is $45^{\\prime \\prime}$. Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of angular diameter and the relationship between the angular diameter of an object and its linear diameter as seen from a certain distance.\nStep 2:  First, we need to convert the angular diameter of the planet from seconds of arc to radians. We know that $1^{\\prime \\prime} = \\frac{1}{3600} \\mathrm{rad}$, so $45^{\\prime \\prime} = 45 \\times \\frac{1}{3600} \\mathrm{rad} = \\frac{1}{80} \\mathrm{rad}$.\nStep 3:  The linear diameter of the planet can be found using the formula $d = \\theta \\times f$, where $d$ is the linear diameter, $\\theta$ is the angular diameter in radians, and $f$ is the focal length of the telescope.\nStep 4:  Substituting the given values, we get $d = \\frac{1}{80} \\mathrm{rad} \\times 72 \\mathrm{~m} = 0.9 \\mathrm{~m}$.\nStep 5:  Now, we need to find the diameter of the image of the planet at the focus of the telescope. The diameter of the image is given by the formula $D = \\frac{d}{M}$, where $D$ is the diameter of the image, $d$ is the linear diameter of the planet, and $M$ is the magnification of the telescope.\nStep 6:  The magnification of the telescope is given by the formula $M = \\frac{f}{D}$, where $f$ is the focal length of the telescope and $D$ is the diameter of the telescope.\nStep 7:  Substituting the given values, we get $M = \\frac{72 \\mathrm{~m}}{6.5 \\mathrm{~m}} = 11.08$.\nStep 8:  Now, we can find the diameter of the image of the planet using the formula $D = \\frac{d}{M}$. Substituting the values, we get $D = \\frac{0.9 \\mathrm{~m}}{11.08} = 0.081 \\mathrm{~m}$.\nStep 9:  Finally, we need to convert the diameter of the image from meters to centimeters. We know that $1 \\mathrm{~m} = 100 \\mathrm{~cm}$, so $0.081 \\mathrm{~m} = 8.1 \\mathrm{~cm}$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the diameter of the image of the planet at the focus of the telescope is $8.1 \\mathrm{~cm}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8.1}$",

  "## Step 1: Recall Snell's law\nSnell's law states that the ratio of the sines of the angles of incidence and refraction is equal to the ratio of the velocities of the two media, or equivalently, the inverse ratio of the indices of refraction. Mathematically, this can be expressed as $n_1 \\sin{\\theta_1} = n_2 \\sin{\\theta_2}$, where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the indices of refraction of the first and second media, respectively, and $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$ are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.\n\n## Step 2: Apply Snell's law to the given problem\nIn this problem, the light is incident on the water surface at an angle $\\theta_w$ with respect to the surface normal.

This gives us $\\sin{\\theta_a} = 1.3 \\sin{\\theta_w}$. To find $\\theta_a$, we take the inverse sine of both sides, which gives us $\\theta_a = \\arcsin{1.3 \\sin{\\theta_w}}$.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the critical angle\nThe critical angle is the value of $\\theta_w$ such that the light will not emerge from the water. This occurs when $\\sin{\\theta_a} = 1$, since the sine of the angle of refraction is equal to 1 when the angle of refraction is 90 degrees. Using Snell's law, we have $1.3 \\sin{\\theta_w} = 1$. To find the critical angle, we can rearrange this equation to isolate $\\sin{\\theta_w}$, which gives us $\\sin{\\theta_w} = \\frac{1}{1.3}$. To find the critical angle, we take the inverse sine of both sides, which gives us $\\theta_w = \\arcsin{\\frac{1}{1.3}}$.\n\n## Step 5: Write the final answer\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\arcsin{1.3 \\sin{\\theta_w}}}$",

We need to find the volume of NaI required to precipitate all the Hg2+ ions.\n\nStep 2: To find the volume of NaI needed, we first need to calculate the number of moles of Hg2+ ions present in the 45 mL of Hg(NO3)2 solution. We can do this by multiplying the molarity of Hg(NO3)2 by the volume of the solution in liters.\n\nStep 3: The molarity of Hg(NO3)2 is 0.10 M, and the volume of the solution is 45 mL, which is 0.045 L.

It is defined as the product of the concentrations of the ions in the solution, each raised to the power of its stoichiometric coefficient in the balanced equation.\nStep 4:  In this case, the solubility product expression for $\\mathrm{Bi}_{2} \\mathrm{~S}_{3}$ is $[\\mathrm{Bi}^{3+}]^{2}[\\mathrm{S}^{2-}]^{3} = 1.6 \\times 10^{-72}$.\nStep 5:  We are asked to find the number of moles of $\\mathrm{Bi}_{2} \\mathrm{~S}_{3}$ that will dissolve in $3.091 \\times 10^{6}$ liters of water at room temperature.\nStep 6:  To do this, we need to first determine the concentrations of $\\mathrm{Bi}^{3+}$ and $\\mathrm{S}^{2-}$ ions in the solution.\nStep 7:  Let's assume that $x$ moles of $\\mathrm{Bi}_{2} \\mathrm{~S}_{3}$ dissolve in the given volume of water. This means that $2x$ moles of $\\mathrm{Bi}^{3+}$ and $3x$ moles of $\\mathrm{S}^{2-}$ will be produced.\nStep 8:  The concentration of $\\mathrm{Bi}^{3+}$ ions will be $\\frac{2x}{3.091 \\times 10^{6}}$ M, and the concentration of $\\mathrm{S}^{2-}$ ions will be $\\frac{3x}{3.091 \\times 10^{6}}$ M.\nStep 9:  We can then use the solubility product expression to set up an equation and solve for $x$, which represents the number of moles of $\\mathrm{Bi}_{2} \\mathrm{~S}_{3}$ that will dissolve in the given volume of water.\nStep 10:  Once we have the value of $x$, we can express it in the required format as $n \\times 10^x$ where $n$ is to 1 decimal place.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1.0 \\times 10^{-23}}",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of half-life and how it relates to the decay of radioactive isotopes.\nStep 2:  The half-life of a radioactive isotope is the time it takes for half of the initial amount of the isotope to decay. In this case, the half-life of tritium ($^{3}H$) is given as 12.5 years.\nStep 3:  We are told that the activity of the whiskey is 6% of that encountered in fresh bourbon. This means that 94% of the tritium has decayed over the unknown period of time.\nStep 4:  We can use the concept of half-life to determine the number of half-lives that have passed. Since 94% of the tritium has decayed, we can express this as $0.94 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n$, where $n$ is the number of half-lives.\nStep 5:  Solving for $n$, we get $n = \\log_{\\frac{1}{2}} 0.94 \\approx 1.16$ half-lives.\nStep 6:  Now, we can calculate the age of the whiskey by multiplying the number of half-lives by the half-life of tritium. This gives us $1.16 \\times 12.5 \\approx 14.5$ years.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the age of the whiskey in question is approximately 14.5 years.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{14.5}$",

  "Step 1:  To find the maximum age of a sample that can be dated, we need to consider the decay rate of ${ }^{14} \\mathrm{C}$ and the experimental uncertainty in measuring this decay rate.\nStep 2:  The decay rate of ${ }^{14} \\mathrm{C}$ in living tissue is given as $15.3$ disintegrations per minute per gram of carbon, with an experimental uncertainty of $\\pm 0.1$ disintegrations per minute per gram of carbon.\nStep 3:  We are also given that the half-life of ${ }^{14} \\mathrm{C}$ is $5730$ years.\nStep 4:  To determine the maximum age of a sample that can be dated, we need to find the age at which the number of disintegrations per minute per gram of carbon is equal to the experimental uncertainty.\nStep 5:  This is because if the number of disintegrations per minute per gram of carbon is less than the experimental uncertainty, it would be impossible to determine the age of the sample accurately.\nStep 6:  We can use the formula for radioactive decay to find the age of the sample. The formula is given by $N=N_{0} e^{-\\lambda t}$, where $N$ is the number of disintegrations per minute per gram of carbon, $N_{0}$ is the initial number of disintegrations per minute per gram of carbon, $\\lambda$ is the decay constant, and $t$ is the time in years.\nStep 7:  We can rearrange the formula to solve for $t$, which gives us $t=\\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\ln \\left(\\frac{N_{0}}{N}\\right)$.\nStep 8:  We know that the decay rate of ${ }^{14} \\mathrm{C}$ is $15.3$ disintegrations per minute per gram of carbon, and the experimental uncertainty is $\\pm 0.1$ disintegrations per minute per gram of carbon.\nStep 9:  We can use the half-life of ${ }^{14} \\mathrm{C}$ to find the decay constant $\\lambda$. The half-life is related to the decay constant by the formula $t_{1 / 2}=\\frac{\\ln 2}{\\lambda}$.\nStep 10:  Solving for $\\lambda$, we get $\\lambda=\\frac{\\ln 2}{t_{1 / 2}}$.\nStep 11:  Substituting the given half-life of $5730$ years, we find that $\\lambda=\\frac{\\ln 2}{5730} \\approx 1.21 \\times 10^{-4} \\mathrm{~yr}^{-1}$.\nStep 12:  Now, we can use the formula for $t$ to find the maximum age of a sample that can be dated. We set $N=0.1$ disintegrations per minute per gram of carbon, which is the experimental uncertainty.\nStep 13:  Substituting the values of $N_{0}=15.3$ disintegrations per minute per gram of carbon and $\\lambda=1.21 \\times 10^{-4} \\mathrm{~yr}^{-1}$, we get $t=\\frac{1}{1.21 \\times 10^{-4}} \\ln \\left(\\frac{15.3}{0.1}\\right)$.\nStep 14:  Evaluating this expression, we find that $t \\approx 5.73 \\times 10^{4}$ years.\nStep 15:  Therefore, the maximum age of a sample that can be dated is approximately $57,300$ years.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{57300}$",
