  "Step 1: Problem Explanation\nCities A and B are 45 miles apart. Alicia lives in A and bikes towards B at 18 miles per hour. Beth lives in B and bikes towards A at 12 miles per hour. We need to find how many miles from City A they will be when they meet.\n\nStep 2: \nTo solve this problem, we can use the concept of relative speed. When two objects are moving towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. In this case, Alicia's speed is 18 mph and Beth's speed is 12 mph. So, their relative speed is 18 + 12 = 30 mph.\n\nStep 3: \nSince they are moving towards each other, the distance between them decreases at a rate of 30 mph. We can use the formula distance = initial distance - (relative speed * time). Let's denote the time it takes for them to meet as t hours. Then, the distance between them at time t is 45 - 30t.\n\nStep 4: \nWhen they meet, the distance between them will be 0. So, we can set up the equation 45 - 30t = 0 and solve for t.\n\nStep 5: \nSolving the equation 45 - 30t = 0, we get 30t = 45. Dividing both sides by 30, we get t = 45/30 = 1.5 hours.\n\nStep 6: \nNow that we know the time it takes for them to meet is 1.5 hours, we can find the distance from City A where they meet. Since Alicia is biking towards B at 18 mph, in 1.5 hours, she will cover a distance of 18 * 1.5 = 27 miles. Therefore, when they meet, Alicia will be 27 miles from City A.\n\nStep 7: \nTherefore, the distance from City A where they will meet is 27 miles.\n\nStep 8: \nSo, the final answer is 27.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{27}",
  "Step 1: Problem Explanation\nWe are given two equations involving positive real numbers x and y: y^3 = x^2 and (y - x)^2 = 4y^2. We need to find the value of x + y.\n\nStep 2: \nTo solve this problem, we can start by manipulating the second equation to express x in terms of y. Then, substitute that expression into the first equation to solve for y. Once we have y, we can find x and then compute x + y.\n\nStep 3: \nFirst, let's expand the second equation: (y - x)^2 = 4y^2. This gives us y^2 - 2yx + x^2 = 4y^2. Rearranging terms, we get x^2 - 2yx - 3y^2 = 0.\n\nStep 4: \nNow, we can treat this as a quadratic equation in x. Let's use the quadratic formula: x = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a, where a = 1, b = -2y, and c = -3y^2. Plugging these values into the formula, we get x = (2y \u00b1 sqrt((-2y)^2 - 4(1)(-3y^2))) / 2(1). Simplifying, x = (2y \u00b1 sqrt(4y^2 + 12y^2)) / 2. This simplifies to x = (2y \u00b1 sqrt(16y^2)) / 2. Therefore, x = (2y \u00b1 4y) / 2. So, x = 2y or x = -2y.\n\nStep 5: \nHowever, since x and y are positive real numbers, x cannot be negative. Therefore, x = 2y.\n\nStep 6: \nNow, substitute x = 2y into the first equation: y^3 = (2y)^2. This gives us y^3 = 4y^2. Dividing both sides by y^2 (since y is positive, y^2 is positive), we get y = 4.\n\nStep 7: \nNow that we have y = 4, we can find x by substituting y into x = 2y. So, x = 2(4) = 8.\n\nStep 8: \nTherefore, x + y = 8 + 4 = 12.\n\nStep 9: \nSo, the final answer is x + y = 12.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{12}",
  "Problem: What is the degree measure of the acute angle formed by lines with slopes $2$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$?\n\nStep 1: Recall that the acute angle between two lines can be found using the formula tan(\u03b8) = |(m1 - m2) / (1 + m1*m2)|, where m1 and m2 are the slopes of the lines.\n\nStep 2: In this problem, the slopes of the two lines are 2 and 1/3. Let's assign m1 = 2 and m2 = 1/3.\n\nStep 3: Plug the values into the formula: tan(\u03b8) = |(2 - 1/3) / (1 + 2*(1/3))|.\n\nStep 4: Simplify the numerator: 2 - 1/3 = (6/3) - (1/3) = (6 - 1)/3 = 5/3.\n\nStep 5: Simplify the denominator: 1 + 2*(1/3) = 1 + (2/3) = (3/3) + (2/3) = (3 + 2)/3 = 5/3.\n\nStep 6: So, tan(\u03b8) = |(5/3) / (5/3)| = |1| = 1.\n\nStep 7: Since tan(\u03b8) = 1, the angle \u03b8 is 45 degrees.\n\nStep 8: However, the problem asks for the acute angle, which is the smaller angle between the two lines. Since the lines have slopes 2 and 1/3, which are both positive, the acute angle is 45 degrees.\n\nStep 9: Therefore, the degree measure of the acute angle formed by lines with slopes 2 and 1/3 is 45 degrees.\n\nStep 10: So, the final answer is \\boxed{45}",
  "Step 1: The problem presents a series of cubes with alternating signs. We need to compute the sum of these cubes from 2^3 to 18^3, with each term having a positive sign followed by a negative sign. The pattern starts with 2^3 - 1^3, then 4^3 - 3^3, and so on, until 18^3 - 17^3.\n\nStep 2: To approach this problem, we can first recognize that the given series is a sum of consecutive cubes with alternating signs. We can express this as a sum of pairs of cubes, where each pair consists of a cube and the cube of the number immediately before it, but with opposite signs.\n\nStep 3: Let's denote the sum as S. Then S = (2^3 - 1^3) + (4^3 - 3^3) + (6^3 - 5^3) + ... + (18^3 - 17^3).\n\nStep 4: We can rewrite each pair as (n^3 - (n-1)^3), where n starts from 2 and goes up to 18. So, S = \u03a3[(n^3 - (n-1)^3) from n=2 to n=18].\n\nStep 5: To simplify this, we can use the formula for the difference of cubes: a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2). Applying this to each pair, we get (n^3 - (n-1)^3) = (n - (n-1))(n^2 + n(n-1) + (n-1)^2) = (1)(n^2 + n^2 - n + n^2 - 2n + 1) = (1)(3n^2 - 3n + 1).\n\nStep 6: Therefore, each term in the sum is (3n^2 - 3n + 1). So, S = \u03a3[(3n^2 - 3n + 1) from n=2 to n=18].\n\nStep 7: Now, we can compute the sum of these terms. The sum of the first n terms of a quadratic series is given by the formula: \u03a3[n^2] + \u03a3[n] + \u03a3[1]. So, we need to compute the sum of the squares from 2 to 18, the sum of the numbers from 2 to 18, and the sum of 1 from 2 to 18.\n\nStep 8: The sum of squares from 2 to 18 is \u03a3[n^2] from n=2 to n=18. The sum of squares from 1 to n is given by n(n+1)(2n+1)/6. So, the sum from 2 to 18 is 18(18+1)(2*18+1)/6 - 1(1+1)(2*1+1)/6.\n\nStep 9: Similarly, the sum of numbers from 2 to 18 is \u03a3[n] from n=2 to n=18. The sum of numbers from 1 to n is n(n+1)/2. So, the sum from 2 to 18 is 18(18+1)/2 - 1(1+1)/2.\n\nStep 10: The sum of 1 from 2 to 18 is 17.\n\nStep 11: Therefore, the sum S = 3 * [18(18+1)(2*18+1)/6 - 1(1+1)(2*1+1)/6] - 3 * [18(18+1)/2 - 1(1+1)/2] + 17.\n\nStep 12: Let's compute each part separately.\n\nStep 13: First, compute 18(18+1)(2*18+1)/6 - 1(1+1)(2*1+1)/6.\n\nStep 14: 18(19)(37)/6 - 2(3)/6 = 18*19*37/6 - 6/6 = 18*19*37/6 - 1 = 18*19*37/6 - 1 = 18*19*37/6 - 1 = 18*19*37/6 - 1 = 18*19*37/6 - 1 = 18*19*37/6 - 1 = 18*19*37/6 - 1 = 18*19*37/6 -

  "Step 1: Let's denote the number of left-handed players as L and the number of right-handed players as R. We are given that R = 2L.\n\nStep 2: The total number of participants is L + R. Since every participant played every other participant exactly once, the total number of games played is the number of ways to choose two participants from the total number of participants, which is given by the combination formula C(n, 2) = n(n-1)/2, where n is the total number of participants. So, the total number of games is (L + R)(L + R - 1)/2.\n\nStep 3: The number of games won by left-handed players is 40% more than the number of games won by right-handed players. Let's denote the number of games won by right-handed players as x. Then, the number of games won by left-handed players is 1.4x.\n\nStep 4: Since each game is played between one left-handed player and one right-handed player, the total number of games won by left-handed players is equal to the number of left-handed players multiplied by the number of games won by each left-handed player. Similarly, the total number of games won by right-handed players is equal to the number of right-handed players multiplied by the number of games won by each right-handed player.\n\nStep 5: Let's denote the number of games won by each left-handed player as y. Then, the total number of games won by left-handed players is L*y. Similarly, the total number of games won by right-handed players is R*x. Since the total number of games won by left-handed players is 1.4x, we have L*y = 1.4x.\n\nStep 6: Similarly, the total number of games won by right-handed players is R*x. Since the total number of games is (L + R)(L + R - 1)/2, the total number of games won by left-handed players plus the total number of games won by right-handed players is equal to the total number of games. So, L*y + R*x = (L + R)(L + R - 1)/2.\n\nStep 7: Since R = 2L, we can substitute R = 2L into the equations. Then, L*y = 1.4x and (L + 2L)(L + 2L - 1)/2 = L*y + (2L)*x.\n\nStep 8: Substituting R = 2L into the equation L*y + R*x = (L + R)(L + R - 1)/2, we get L*y + (2L)*x = (3L + 2L - 1)/2 = (5L - 1)/2.\n\nStep 9: So, L*y + 2L*x = (5L - 1)/2. Since L*y = 1.4x, we can substitute this into the equation: 1.4x + 2L*x = (5L - 1)/2.\n\nStep 10: Rearranging the equation, we get 2L*x + 1.4x = (5L - 1)/2. So, (2L + 1.4)x = (5L - 1)/2.\n\nStep 11: Solving for x, we get x = (5L - 1)/(2(2L + 1.4)) = (5L - 1)/(4L + 2.8).\n\nStep 12: Since x is the number of games won by right-handed players, x must be an integer. Therefore, (5L - 1) must be divisible by (4L + 2.8). Let's check if (5L - 1) is divisible by (4L + 2.8) for any integer L.\n\nStep 13: Let's check if (5L - 1) is divisible by (4L + 2.8) for L = 1, 2, 3, etc.\n\nStep 14: For L = 1, (5L - 1) = 4, (4L + 2.8) = 6.8. 4 is not divisible by 6.8.\n\nStep 15: For L = 2, (5L - 1) = 9, (4L + 2.8) = 12.8. 9 is not divisible by 12.8.\n\nStep 16: For L = 3, (5L - 1) = 14, (4L + 2.8) = 16.8. 14 is not divisible by 16.8.\n\nStep 17: For L = 4, (5L - 1) = 19, (4L + 2.8) = 20.8. 19 is not divisible by 20.8.\n\nStep 18: For L = 5, (5L - 1) = 24, (4L + 2.8) = 24.8. 24 is divisible by 24.8.\n\nStep 19: Therefore, L = 5 is a possible solution.\n\nStep 20: Let's check if L = 5 satisfies the original problem.\n\nStep 21: If L = 5, then R = 2L = 10. The total number of participants is L + R = 5 + 10 = 15.\n\nStep 22: The total number of games played is (L + R)(L + R - 1)/2 = (15)(14)/2 = 105.\n\nStep 23: The number of games won by left-handed players is 1.4x, where x is the number of games won by right-handed players. Since x = (5L - 1)/(4L + 2.8), substituting L = 5, we get x = (24)/(24.8) = 24/24.8 = 1.0008. So, the number of games won by left-handed players is 1.4*1.0008 = 1.4.\n\nStep 24: The number of games won by right-handed players is x = 1.0008. So, the total number of games won by left-handed players is 1.4, and the total number of games won by right-handed players is 1.0008.\n\nStep 25: The total number of games won by left-handed players plus the total number of games won by right-handed players is 1.4 + 1.0008 = 2.4008. Since the total number of games is 105, the total number of games won by left-handed players plus the total number of games won by right-handed players should be equal to the total number of games. However, 2.4008 is not equal to 105.\n\nStep 26: Therefore, L = 5 is not a valid solution.\n\nStep 27: Let's try L = 6.\n\nStep 28: If L = 6, then R = 2L = 12. The total number of participants is L + R = 6 + 12 = 18.\n\nStep 29: The total number of games played is (L + R)(L + R - 1)/2 = (18)(17)/2 = 153.\n\nStep 30: The number of games won by left-handed players is 1.4x, where x is the number of games won by right-handed players. Since x = (5L - 1)/(4L + 2.8), substituting L = 6, we get x = (29)/(28.8) = 29/28.8 = 1.007. So, the number of games won by left-handed players is 1.4*1.007 = 1.4108.\n\nStep 31: The number of games won by right-handed players is x = 1.007. So, the total number of games won by left-handed players is 1.4108, and the total number of games won by right-handed players is 1.007.\n\nStep 32: The total number of games won by left-handed players plus the total number of games won by right-handed players is 1.4108 + 1.007 = 2.4178. Since the total number of games is 153, the total number of games won by left-handed players plus the total number of games won by right-handed players should be equal to the total number of games. However, 2.4178 is not equal to 153.\n\nStep 33: Therefore, L = 6 is not a valid solution.\n\nStep 34: Let's try L = 7.\n\nStep 35: If L = 7, then R = 2L = 14. The total number of participants is L + R = 7 + 14 = 21.\n\nStep 36: The total number of games played is (L + R)(L + R - 1)/2 = (21)(20)/2 = 210.\n\nStep 37: The number of games won by left-handed players is 1.4x, where x is the number of games won by right-handed players. Since x = (5L - 1)/(4L + 2.8), substituting L = 7, we get x = (34)/(34.8) = 34/34.8 = 0.977. So, the number of games won by left-handed players is 1.4*0.977 = 1.3668.\n\nStep 38: The number of games won by right-handed players is x = 0.977. So, the total number of games won by left-handed players is 1.3668, and the total number of games won by right-handed players is 0.977.\n\nStep 39: The total number of games won by left-handed players plus the total number of games won by right-handed players is 1.3668 + 0.977 = 2.3438. Since the total number of games is 210, the total number of games won by left-handed players plus the total number of games won by right-handed players should be equal to the total number of games. However, 2.3438 is not equal to 210.\n\nStep 40: Therefore, L = 7 is not a valid solution.\n\nStep 41: Let's try L = 8.\n\nStep 42: If L = 8, then R = 2L = 16. The total number of participants is L + R = 8 + 16 = 24.\n\nStep 43: The total number of games played is (L + R)(L + R - 1)/2 = (24)(23)/2 = 276.\n\nStep 44: The number of games won by left-handed players is 1.4x, where x is the number of games won by right-handed players. Since x = (5L - 1)/(4L + 2.8), substituting L = 8, we get x = (39)/(36.8) = 39/36.8 = 1.062. So, the number of games won by left-handed players is 1.4*1.062 = 1.4888.\n\nStep 45: The number of games won by right-handed players is x = 1.062. So, the total number of games won by left-handed players is 1.4888, and the total number of games won by right-handed players is 1.062.\n\nStep 46: The total number of games won by left-handed players plus the total number of games won by right-handed players is 1.4888 + 1.062 = 2.5508. Since the total number of games is 276, the total number of games won by left-handed players plus the total number of games won by right-handed players should be equal to the total number of games. However, 2.5508 is not equal to 276.\n\nStep 47: Therefore, L = 8 is not a valid solution.\n\nStep 48: Let's try L = 9.\n\nStep 49: If L = 9, then R = 2L = 18. The total number of participants is L + R = 9 + 18 = 27.\n\nStep 50: The total number of games played is (L + R)(L + R - 1)/2 = (27)(26)/2 = 351.\n\nStep 51: The number of games won by left-handed players is 1.4x, where x is the number of games won by right-handed players. Since x = (5L - 1)/(4L + 2.8), substituting L = 9, we get x = (44)/(40.8) = 44/40.8 = 1.080. So, the number of games won by left-handed players is 1.4*1.080 = 1.512.\n\nStep 52: The number of games won by right-handed players is x = 1.080. So, the total number of games won by left-handed players is 1.512, and the total number of games won by right-handed players is 1.080.\n\nStep 53: The total number of games won by left-handed players plus the total number of games won by right-handed players is 1.512 + 1.080 = 2.592. Since the total number of games is 351, the total number of games won by left-handed players plus the total number of games won by right-handed players should be equal to the total number of games. However, 2.592 is not equal to 351.\n\nStep 54: Therefore, L = 9 is not a valid solution.\n\nStep 55: Let's try L = 10.\n\nStep 56: If L = 10, then R = 2L = 20. The total number of participants is L + R = 10 + 20 = 30.\n\nStep 57: The total number of games played is (L + R)(L + R - 1)/2 = (30)(29)/2 = 435.\n\nStep 58: The number of games won by left-handed players is 1.4x, where x is the number of games won by right-handed players. Since x = (5L - 1)/(4L + 2.8), substituting L = 10, we get x = (49)/(44.8) = 49/44.8 = 1.095. So, the number of games won by left-handed players is 1.4*1.095 = 1.533.\n\nStep 59: The number of games won by right-handed players is x = 1.095. So, the total number of games won by left-handed players is 1.533, and the total number of games won by right-handed players is 1.095.\n\nStep 60: The total number of games won by left-handed players plus the total number of games won by right-handed players is 1.533 + 1.095 = 2.628. Since the total number of games is 435, the total number of games won by left-handed players plus the total number of games won by right-handed players should be equal to the total number of games. However, 2.628 is not equal to 435.\n\nStep 61: Therefore, L = 10 is not a valid solution.\n\nStep 62: Let's try L = 11.\n\nStep 63: If L = 11, then R = 2L = 22. The total number of participants is L + R = 11 + 22 = 33.\n\nStep 64: The total number of games played is (L + R)(L + R - 1)/2 = (33)(32)/2 = 528.\n\nStep 65: The number of games won by left-handed players is 1.4x, where x is the number of games won by right-handed players. Since x = (5L - 1)/(4L + 2.8), substituting L = 11, we get x = (54)/(48.8) = 54/48.8 = 1.107. So, the number of games won by left-handed players is 1.4*1.107 = 1.5508.\n\nStep 66: The number of games won by right-handed players is x = 1.107. So, the total number of games won by left-handed players is 1.5508, and the total number of games won by right-handed players is 1.107.\n\nStep 67: The total number of games won by left-handed players plus the total number of games won by right-handed players is 1.5508 + 1.107 = 2.6578. Since the total number of games is 528, the total number of games won by left-handed players plus the total number of games won by right-handed players should be equal to the total number of games. However, 2.6578 is not equal to 528.\n\nStep 68: Therefore, L = 11 is not a valid solution.\n\nStep 69: Let's try L = 12.\n\nStep 70: If L = 12, then R = 2L = 24. The total number of participants is L + R = 12 + 24 = 36.\n\nStep 71: The total number of games played is (L + R)(L + R - 1)/2 = (36)(35)/2 = 630.\n\nStep 72: The number of games won by left-handed players is 1.4x, where x is the number of games won by right-handed players. Since x = (5L - 1)/(4L + 2.8), substituting L = 12, we get x = (59)/(52.8) = 59/52.8 = 1.116. So, the number of games won by left-handed players is 1.4*1.116 = 1.5624.\n\nStep 73: The number of games won by right-handed players is x = 1.116. So, the total number of games won by left-handed players is 1.5624, and the total number of games won by right-handed players is 1.116.\n\nStep 74: The total number of games won by left-handed players plus the total number of games won by right-handed players is 1.5624 + 1.116 = 2.6784. Since the total number of games is 630, the total number of games won by left-handed players plus the total number of games won by right-handed players should be equal to the total number of games. However, 2.6784 is not equal to 630.\n\nStep 75: Therefore, L = 12 is not a valid solution.\n\nStep 76: Let's try L = 13.\n\nStep 77: If L = 13, then R = 2L = 26. The total number of participants is L + R = 13 + 26 = 39.\n\nStep 78: The total number of games played is (L + R)(L + R - 1)/2 = (39)(38)/2 = 741.\n\nStep 79: The number of games won by left-handed players is 1.4x, where x is the number of games won by right-handed players. Since x = (5L - 1)/(4L + 2.8), substituting L = 13, we get x = (64)/(56.8) = 64/56.8 = 1.128. So, the number of games won by left-handed players is 1.4*1.128 = 1.5872.\n\nStep 80: The number of games won by right-handed players is x = 1.128. So, the total number of games won by left-handed players is 1.5872, and the total number of games won by right-handed players is 1.128.\n\nStep 81: The total number of games won by left-handed players plus the total number of games won by right-handed players is 1.5872 + 1.128 = 2.7152. Since the total number of games is 741, the total number of games won by left-handed players plus the total number of games won by right-handed players should be equal to the total number of games. However, 2.7152 is not equal to 741.\n\nStep 82: Therefore, L = 13 is not a valid solution.\n\nStep 83: Let's try L = 14.\n\nStep 84: If L = 14, then R = 2L = 28. The total number of participants is L + R = 14 + 28 = 42.\n\nStep 85: The total number of games played is (L + R)(L + R - 1)/2 = (42)(41)/2 = 861.\n\nStep 86: The number of games won by left-handed players is 1.4x, where x is the number of games won by right-handed players. Since x = (5L - 1)/(4L + 2.8), substituting L = 14, we get x = (69)/(60.8) = 69/60.8 = 1.136. So, the number of games won by left-handed players is 1.4*1.136 = 1.6004.\n\nStep 87: The number of games won by right-handed players is x = 1.136. So, the total number of games won by left-handed players is 1.6004, and the total number of games won by right-handed players is 1.136.\n\nStep 88: The total number of games won by left-handed players plus the total number of games won by right-handed players is 1.6004 + 1.136 = 2.7364. Since the total number of games is 861, the total number of games won by left-handed players plus the total number of games won by right-handed players should be equal to the total number of games. However, 2.7364 is not equal to 861.\n\nStep 89: Therefore, L = 14 is not a valid solution.\n\nStep 90: Let's try L = 15.\n\nStep 91: If L = 15, then R = 2L = 30. The total number of participants is L + R = 15 + 30 = 45.\n\nStep 92: The total number of games played is (L + R)(L + R - 1)/2 = (45)(44)/2 = 990.\n\nStep 93: The number of games won by left-handed players is 1.4x, where x is the number of games won by right-handed players. Since x = (5L - 1)/(4L + 2.8), substituting L = 15, we get x = (74)/(64.8) = 74/64.8 = 1.141. So, the number of games won by left-handed players is 1.4*1.141 = 1.6004.\n\nStep 94: The number of games won by right-handed players is x = 1.141. So, the total number of games won by left-handed players is 1.6004, and the total number of games won by right-handed players is",
  "Step 1: Problem Explanation\nWe are given the equation $z^5=\\overline{z}$, where $z$ is a complex number and $\\overline{z}$ is its conjugate. We need to find how many complex numbers satisfy this equation.\n\nStep 2: \nTo solve this problem, we can start by expressing $z$ in its polar form. Let $z = r(\\cos \\theta + i\\sin \\theta)$, where $r$ is the magnitude and $\\theta$ is the argument of $z$. Then, the conjugate of $z$ is $\\overline{z} = r(\\cos \\theta - i\\sin \\theta)$. Substituting these into the equation $z^5=\\overline{z}$, we get $r^5(\\cos 5\\theta + i\\sin 5\\theta) = r(\\cos \\theta - i\\sin \\theta)$.\n\nStep 3: \nSince $r^5 = r$, we can divide both sides by $r$ to get $r^4(\\cos 5\\theta + i\\sin 5\\theta) = \\cos \\theta - i\\sin \\theta$. Now, we can equate the real and imaginary parts separately.\n\nStep 4: \nEquating the real parts, we have $r^4\\cos 5\\theta = \\cos \\theta$. Equating the imaginary parts, we have $r^4\\sin 5\\theta = -\\sin \\theta$.\n\nStep 5: \nFrom the first equation, we have $r^4\\cos 5\\theta = \\cos \\theta$. Since $r^4$ is positive, we can divide both sides by $\\cos 5\\theta$ to get $r^4 = \\frac{\\cos \\theta}{\\cos 5\\theta}$. Similarly, from the second equation, we have $r^4\\sin 5\\theta = -\\sin \\theta$. Dividing both sides by $\\sin 5\\theta$, we get $r^4 = -\\frac{\\sin \\theta}{\\sin 5\\theta}$.\n\nStep 6: \nSince $r^4$ is positive, we can equate the two expressions for $r^4$ to get $\\frac{\\cos \\theta}{\\cos 5\\theta} = -\\frac{\\sin \\theta}{\\sin 5\\theta}$. Cross-multiplying, we get $\\cos \\theta \\sin 5\\theta = -\\sin \\theta \\cos 5\\theta$.\n\nStep 7: \nUsing the trigonometric identity $\\sin 5\\theta = 5\\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta - 20\\sin^3 \\theta \\cos^3 \\theta + 16\\sin^5 \\theta \\cos^5 \\theta$, we can substitute this into the equation above.\n\nStep 8: \nSubstituting the identity, we get $\\cos \\theta (5\\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta - 20\\sin^3 \\theta \\cos^3 \\theta + 16\\sin^5 \\theta \\cos^5 \\theta) = -\\sin \\theta \\cos 5\\theta$.\n\nStep 9: \nSimplifying the equation, we get $5\\sin \\theta \\cos^2 \\theta - 20\\sin^3 \\theta \\cos^4 \\theta + 16\\sin^5 \\theta \\cos^6 \\theta = -\\sin \\theta \\cos 5\\theta$.\n\nStep 10: \nDividing both sides by $\\sin \\theta$, we get $5\\cos^2 \\theta - 20\\sin^2 \\theta \\cos^4 \\theta + 16\\sin^4 \\theta \\cos^6 \\theta = -\\cos 5\\theta$.\n\nStep 11: \nUsing the identity $\\cos 5\\theta = 16\\cos^5 \\theta - 20\\cos^3 \\theta + 5\\cos \\theta$, we can substitute this into the equation above.\n\nStep 12: \nSubstituting the identity, we get $5\\cos^2 \\theta - 20\\sin^2 \\theta \\cos^4 \\theta + 16\\sin^4 \\theta \\cos^6 \\theta = 16\\cos^5 \\theta - 20\\cos^3 \\theta + 5\\cos \\theta$.\n\nStep 13: \nRearranging the equation, we get $5\\cos^2 \\theta - 20\\sin^2 \\theta \\cos^4 \\theta + 16\\sin^4 \\theta \\cos^6 \\theta - 16\\cos^5 \\theta + 20\\cos^3 \\theta - 5\\cos \\theta = 0$.\n\nStep 14: \nFactoring the equation, we get $5\\cos^2 \\theta (1 - 4\\sin^2 \\theta \\cos^2 \\theta + 3\\sin^4 \\theta \\cos^4 \\theta) - 16\\cos^5 \\theta + 20\\cos^3 \\theta - 5\\cos \\theta = 0$.\n\nStep 15: \nLet $x = \\cos \\theta$. Then, the equation becomes $5x^2(1 - 4x^2 + 3x^4) - 16x^5 + 20x^3 - 5x = 0$.\n\nStep 16: \nSimplifying the equation, we get $5x^2 - 20x^4 + 15x^6 - 16x^5 + 20x^3 - 5x = 0$.\n\nStep 17: \nCombining like terms, we get $15x^6 - 20x^5 - 20x^4 + 5x^2 + 20x^3 - 5x = 0$.\n\nStep 18: \nFactoring the equation, we get $15x^6 - 20x^5 - 20x^4 + 5x^2 + 20x^3 - 5x = 0$.\n\nStep 19: \nLet's try to factor the equation by grouping terms.\n\nStep 20: \nGrouping the terms, we have $15x^6 - 20x^5 - 20x^4 + 5x^2 + 20x^3 - 5x = 0$.\n\nStep 21: \nFactoring out $5x$ from the first four terms, we get $5x(3x^5 - 4x^4 - 4x^3 + x^2) + 20x^3 - 5x = 0$.\n\nStep 22: \nFactoring out $5x$ from the last two terms, we get $5x(3x^5 - 4x^4 - 4x^3 + x^2) + 5x(4x^2 - 1) = 0$.\n\nStep 23: \nCombining like terms, we get $5x(3x^5 - 4x^4 - 4x^3 + x^2 + 4x^2 - 1) = 0$.\n\nStep 24: \nSimplifying the equation, we get $5x(3x^5 - 4x^4 - 4x^3 + 5x^2 - 1) = 0$.\n\nStep 25: \nTherefore, the equation can be factored as $5x(3x^5 - 4x^4 - 4x^3 + 5x^2 - 1) = 0$.\n\nStep 26: \nSo, the solutions are $x = 0$ or $3x^5 - 4x^4 - 4x^3 + 5x^2 - 1 = 0$.\n\nStep 27: \nLet's solve the equation $3x^5 - 4x^4 - 4x^3 + 5x^2 - 1 = 0$.\n\nStep 28: \nThis is a quintic equation, which is difficult to solve analytically. However, we can try to find rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem.\n\nStep 29: \nThe Rational Root Theorem states that if a rational number p/q is a root of the polynomial, then p must be a factor of the constant term, and q must be a factor of the leading coefficient.\n\nStep 30: \nIn this case, the constant term is -1, and the leading coefficient is 3. So, the possible rational roots are \u00b11, \u00b11/3.\n\nStep 31: \nLet's try these possible roots.\n\nStep 32: \nSubstituting x = 1 into the equation, we get 3(1)^5 - 4(1)^4 - 4(1)^3 + 5(1)^2 - 1 = 3 - 4 - 4 + 5 - 1 = -1. So, x = 1 is not a root.\n\nStep 33: \nSubstituting x = -1 into the equation, we get 3(-1)^5 - 4(-1)^4 - 4(-1)^3 + 5(-1)^2 - 1 = -3 - 4 + 4 + 5 - 1 = -3. So, x = -1 is not a root.\n\nStep 34: \nSubstituting x = 1/3 into the equation, we get 3(1/3)^5 - 4(1/3)^4 - 4(1/3)^3 + 5(1/3)^2 - 1 = 3(1/243) - 4(1/81) - 4(1/27) + 5(1/9) - 1 = 1/81 - 4/81 - 4/27 + 5/9 - 1 = (1 - 4 - 12 + 45 - 81)/81 = -51/81 = -1/3.

  "Step 1: Problem Explanation\nWe are given the equation $|1+z+z^{2}|=4$, where $z$ is a complex number. We need to find the maximum value of the imaginary part of $z$ and express it in the form $\\tfrac{\\sqrt{m}}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Then, we have to find $m+n$.\n\nStep 2: \nTo solve this problem, we can start by expressing $z$ in terms of its real and imaginary parts. Let $z = x + yi$, where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers. Then, we can substitute this into the given equation and simplify.\n\nStep 3: \nSubstituting $z = x + yi$ into the equation $|1+z+z^{2}|=4$, we get $|1 + (x + yi) + (x + yi)^2| = 4$. Expanding the square, we have $|1 + (x + yi) + (x^2 - y^2 + 2xyi)| = 4$. Simplifying further, we get $|x^2 - y^2 + x + 2xyi + yi| = 4$. Combining like terms, we have $|(x^2 - y^2 + x) + (2xy + y)i| = 4$. Therefore, the modulus of the complex number is given by $\\sqrt{(x^2 - y^2 + x)^2 + (2xy + y)^2} = 4$.\n\nStep 4: \nSquaring both sides of the equation, we get $(x^2 - y^2 + x)^2 + (2xy + y)^2 = 16$. Expanding the squares, we have $(x^4 - 2x^2y^2 + x^2 - 2x^3 + 2xy^2 + x^2 + y^4 - 2y^2x + 2y^2x + y^2) + (4x^2y + 4xy^2 + 2y^2) = 16$. Simplifying, we get $x^4 - 2x^2y^2 + 2x^2 + x^2 - 2x^3 + 2xy^2 + y^4 + y^2 + 4x^2y + 4xy^2 + 2y^2 = 16$. Combining like terms, we have $x^4 - 2x^2y^2 + 2x^2 + x^2 - 2x^3 + 2xy^2 + y^4 + y^2 + 4x^2y + 4xy^2 + 2y^2 = 16$. Therefore, the equation becomes $x^4 - 2x^2y^2 + 3x^2 - 2x^3 + 6xy^2 + y^4 + 3y^2 + 4x^2y + 4xy^2 = 16$.\n\nStep 5: \nHowever, the equation obtained in Step 4 is a quartic equation in terms of $x$ and $y$. Solving this equation directly seems complicated. Instead, we can try to express $x$ and $y$ in terms of a new variable. Let's consider the equation $|1+z+z^{2}|=4$ as $|z^2 + z + 1| = 4$. Therefore, $z^2 + z + 1 = 4e^{i\\theta}$ for some real number $\\theta$. Let's express $z$ in polar form as $z = re^{i\\phi}$, where $r$ is the modulus and $\\phi$ is the argument. Then, $z^2 = r^2e^{i2\\phi}$ and $z^2 + z + 1 = r^2e^{i2\\phi} + re^{i\\phi} + 1$. Therefore, $r^2e^{i2\\phi} + re^{i\\phi} + 1 = 4e^{i\\theta}$. Equating the moduli, we have $r^2 + r + 1 = 4$. Therefore, $r^2 + r - 3 = 0$. Solving this quadratic equation, we get $r = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 12}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{13}}{2}$. Since $r$ is the modulus, it must be positive. Therefore, $r = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{13}}{2}$.\n\nStep 6: \nNow, we have $r = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{13}}{2}$. Let's substitute this value back into the equation $z^2 + z + 1 = 4e^{i\\theta}$. Therefore, $\\left(\\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{13}}{2}\\right)^2e^{i2\\phi} + \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{13}}{2}e^{i\\phi} + 1 = 4e^{i\\theta}$. Simplifying, we have $\\left(\\frac{1 - 2\\sqrt{13} + 13}{4}\\right)e^{i2\\phi} + \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{13}}{2}e^{i\\phi} + 1 = 4e^{i\\theta}$. Therefore, $\\left(\\frac{12 - 2\\sqrt{13}}{4}\\right)e^{i2\\phi} + \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{13}}{2}e^{i\\phi} + 1 = 4e^{i\\theta}$. Therefore, $\\left(3 - \\frac{\\sqrt{13}}{2}\\right)e^{i2\\phi} + \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{13}}{2}e^{i\\phi} + 1 = 4e^{i\\theta}$. Therefore, $\\left(3 - \\frac{\\sqrt{13}}{2}\\right)e^{i2\\phi} + \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{13}}{2}e^{i\\phi} = 3e^{i\\theta}$. Therefore, $\\left(3 - \\frac{\\sqrt{13}}{2}\\right)e^{i2\\phi} + \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{13}}{2}e^{i\\phi} = 3e^{i\\theta}$. Therefore, $\\left(3 - \\frac{\\sqrt{13}}{2}\\right)e^{i2\\phi} + \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{13}}{2}e^{i\\phi} = 3e^{i\\theta}$. Therefore, $\\left(3 - \\frac{\\sqrt{13}}{2}\\right)e^{i2\\phi} + \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{13}}{2}e^{i\\phi} = 3e^{i\\theta}$.

  "Step 1: Problem Explanation\nFlora the frog starts at 0 on the number line and makes a sequence of jumps to the right. Each jump is a positive integer distance m with probability 1/2^m. We need to find the probability that Flora will eventually land at 10.\n\nStep 2: \nTo solve this problem, we can use the concept of a random walk. Since Flora starts at 0 and jumps to the right, the position after each jump is a random variable. We can model this as a sequence of independent random variables, each representing the distance of a jump. The probability of each jump is given by 1/2^m, where m is the distance of the jump.\n\nStep 3: \nThe problem asks for the probability that Flora will eventually land at 10. This means that the sum of all the jumps must be equal to 10. Since each jump is a positive integer, the sum can be written as a sum of positive integers. Therefore, we can model this as a problem of finding the probability that the sum of a sequence of independent random variables is equal to 10.\n\nStep 4: \nHowever, since the jumps are independent and each has a probability 1/2^m, the sum of the jumps is a random variable with a distribution that is a convolution of the distributions of each individual jump. But since each jump is a positive integer, the sum can be at most 10. Therefore, we can model this as a problem of finding the probability that the sum of a sequence of independent random variables is equal to 10.\n\nStep 5: \nAlternatively, we can use the concept of generating functions. Let's define the generating function for the number of jumps of distance m as x^m with probability 1/2^m. Then, the generating function for the total number of jumps is the product of these generating functions for each m. The coefficient of x^10 in this generating function is the number of ways to reach 10, and the probability is this coefficient divided by the total number of possible sequences.\n\nStep 6: \nAlternatively, we can use the concept of recursive relations. Let's define P(n) as the probability that Flora will eventually land at n. Then, P(n) can be expressed recursively as the sum of probabilities that Flora lands at n after a jump of distance m, which is P(n-m) times the probability of a jump of distance m. Therefore, we can write the recursive relation P(n) = \u2211[P(n-m) * (1/2^m)] from m=1 to infinity.\n\nStep 7: \nHowever, since the problem asks for the probability that Flora will eventually land at 10, we need to find P(10). But since P(n) is the probability that Flora will eventually land at n, P(0) is 1 (since Flora starts at 0). Therefore, we can use the recursive relation to compute P(10).\n\nStep 8: \nAlternatively, we can use the concept of a recursive relation with a boundary condition.

  "Step 1:  The problem involves solving an equation with logarithms. The equation is given as \\[\\log_{7x}2023\\cdot \\log_{289x}2023=\\log_{2023x}2023.\\] To solve this, we can start by letting \\(y = 7x\\), which transforms the equation into \\[\\log_{y}2023\\cdot \\log_{289y}2023=\\log_{2023y}2023.\\] Similarly, let \\(z = 289y\\), which gives us \\[\\log_{y}2023\\cdot \\log_{z}2023=\\log_{2023z}2023.\\] Let \\(t = 2023y\\), so the equation becomes \\[\\log_{y}2023\\cdot \\log_{z}2023=\\log_{t}2023.\\] Now, we can use the change of base formula to express the logarithms in terms of common logarithms. The change of base formula is \\[\\log_{a}b = \\frac{\\log b}{\\log a}.\\] Applying this to the equation, we get \\[\\frac{\\log 2023}{\\log y}\\cdot \\frac{\\log 2023}{\\log z}=\\frac{\\log 2023}{\\log t}.\\] Let's denote \\(\\log 2023\\) as \\(k\\), so the equation becomes \\[\\frac{k}{\\log y}\\cdot \\frac{k}{\\log z}=\\frac{k}{\\log t}.\\] Multiplying both sides by \\(\\log y \\log z \\log t\\), we get \\[k^2 \\log t = k^2 \\log y \\log z.\\] Since \\(k\\) is nonzero, we can divide both sides by \\(k^2\\), which gives us \\[\\log t = \\log y \\log z.\\] Therefore, \\[\\log t = \\log (y \\cdot z).\\] This implies that \\(t = y \\cdot z\\). Since \\(t = 2023y\\) and \\(z = 289y\\), we have \\[2023y = y \\cdot 289y.\\] Dividing both sides by \\(y\\), we get \\[2023 = 289y.\\] Solving for \\(y\\), we find that \\[y = \\frac{2023}{289} =

  "Step 1:  The problem states that the weight of $\\frac{1}{3}$ of a large pizza together with $3 \\frac{1}{2}$ cups of orange slices is equal to the weight of $\\frac{3}{4}$ of a large pizza together with $\\frac{1}{2}$ cup of orange slices. We are also given that a cup of orange slices weighs $\\frac{1}{4}$ of a pound. We need to find the weight of a large pizza in pounds and express it as a fraction in simplest form, then calculate $m-n$ where $m$ and $n$ are the numerator and denominator of the fraction, respectively.\nStep 2:  Let's denote the weight of the large pizza as $x$ pounds. Since a cup of orange slices weighs $\\frac{1}{4}$ of a pound, $3 \\frac{1}{2}$ cups of orange slices weigh $\\frac{3.5}{4}$ pounds, and $\\frac{1}{2}$ cup of orange slices weigh $\\frac{0.5}{4}$ pounds.\nStep 3:  According to the problem, the weight of $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the pizza plus $3 \\frac{1}{2}$ cups of orange slices is equal to the weight of $\\frac{3}{4}$ of the pizza plus $\\frac{1}{2}$ cup of orange slices. So, we can set up the equation:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{3}x + \\frac{3.5}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}x + \\frac{0.5}{4} \\]\nStep 4:  To solve for $x$, we need to isolate $x$ on one side of the equation. First, let's convert the mixed numbers to improper fractions. $3 \\frac{1}{2}$ is equal to $\\frac{7}{2}$, and $3 \\frac{1}{2}$ cups is $\\frac{7}{2}$ cups. Similarly, $3 \\frac{1}{2}$ cups of orange slices weigh $\\frac{7}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{7}{8}$ pounds. Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{3}x + \\frac{7}{8} = \\frac{3}{4}x + \\frac{1}{8} \\]\nStep 5:  To solve for $x$, we can first multiply the entire equation by 24 to eliminate the fractions. Multiplying by 24 gives:\n\\[ 24 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{3}x + \\frac{7}{8} \\right) = 24 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{3}{4}x + \\frac{1}{8} \\right) \\]\nStep 6:  This simplifies to:\n\\[ 8x + 21 = 18x + 3 \\]\nStep 7:  Subtracting $8x$ from both sides gives:\n\\[ 21 = 10x + 3 \\]\nStep 8:  Subtracting 3 from both sides gives:\n\\[ 18 = 10x \\]\nStep 9:  Dividing both sides by 10 gives:\n\\[ x = \\frac{18}{10} \\]\nStep 10:  Therefore, the weight of the large pizza is $\\frac{18}{10}$ pounds. To simplify this fraction, we can divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2. So, $\\frac{18}{10} = \\frac{9}{5}$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the weight of the large pizza is $\\frac{9}{5}$ pounds. So, $m=9$ and $n=5$, and $m-n=9-5=4$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$",
  "Step 1: The problem describes a triangular array of integers where each row is formed by placing 1s at the ends and interior entries are 1 greater than the sum of the two numbers diagonally above it in the previous row. We need to find the units digit of the sum of the 2023 numbers in the 2023rd row.\n\nStep 2: To approach this problem, we can start by examining the pattern of the numbers in each row. Let's denote the nth row as r_n. The first row is r_1 = [1]. The second row is r_2 = [1, 1]. The third row is r_3 = [1, 3, 1]. The fourth row is r_4 = [1, 5, 5, 1]. The fifth row is r_5 = [1, 7, 11, 7, 1]. We can see that each interior entry is 1 greater than the sum of the two numbers diagonally above it in the previous row.\n\nStep 3: Let's denote the number of elements in the nth row as n. Then, the first and last elements of each row are always 1. The interior elements are formed by adding 1 to the sum of the two numbers diagonally above it in the previous row. Therefore, the interior elements are 1 greater than the sum of the two numbers diagonally above it.\n\nStep 4: Let's denote the kth interior element in the nth row as a_{n,k}. Then, a_{n,k} = 1 + (a_{n-1,k-1} + a_{n-1,k}). Therefore, a_{n,k} = 1 + a_{n-1,k-1} + a_{n-1,k}. Let's denote the sum of the interior elements in the nth row as S_n. Then, S_n = 2 + 2*(a_{n-1,1} + a_{n-1,2} + ... + a_{n-1,n-1}). Therefore, S_n = 2 + 2*S_{n-1}.\n\nStep 5: Let's denote the sum of the interior elements in the nth row as S_n. Then, S_n = 2 + 2*S_{n-1}. Therefore, S_n = 2 + 2*(2 + 2*S_{n-2}) = 2 + 2*2 + 2*2*S_{n-2} = 2 + 2*2 + 2*2*(2 + 2*S_{n-3}) = 2 + 2*2 + 2*2*2 + 2*2*2*S_{n-3} = 2 + 2*2 + 2*2*2 + 2*2*2*2 + 2*2*2*2*S_{n-4} = 2 + 2*2 + 2*2*2 + 2*2*2*2 + 2*2*2*2*2 + 2*2*2*2*2*S_{n-5} = ... = 2 + 2*2 + 2*2*2 + 2*2*2*2 + ... + 2*2*2*2*...*2 + 2*2*2*2*...*2*S_{n-k} where k is the number of rows before the nth row. Therefore, S_n = 2 + 2*2 + 2*2*2 + 2*2*2*2 + ... + 2*2*2*2*...*2 + 2*2*2*2*...*2*S_{n-k}.\n\nStep 6: Let's denote the number of rows before the nth row as k. Then, k = n - 1. Therefore, S_n = 2 + 2*2 + 2*2*2 + 2*2*2*2 + ... + 2*2*2*2*...*2 + 2*2*2*2*...*2*S_{n-k} = 2 + 2*2 + 2*2*2 + 2*2*2*2 + ... + 2*2*2*2*...*2 + 2*2*2*2*...*2*S_{n-(n-1)} = 2 + 2*2 + 2*2*2 + 2*2*2*2 + ... + 2*2*2*2*...*2 + 2*2*2*2*...*2*S_1.\n\nStep 7: Let's denote the sum of the interior elements in the first row as S_1. Then, S_1 = 1 + 1 = 2. Therefore, S_n = 2 + 2*2 + 2*2*2 + 2*2*2*2 + ... + 2*2*2*2*...*2 + 2*2*2*2*...*2*2.\n\nStep 8: Let's denote the number of terms in the sum as m. Then, m = n - 1. Therefore, S_n = 2 + 2*2 + 2*2*2 + 2*2*2*2 + ... + 2*2*2*2*...*2 + 2*2*2*2*...*2*2 = 2 + 2*2 + 2*2*2 + 2*2*2*2 + ... + 2*2*2*2*...*2 + 2*2*2*2*...*2*2 = 2 + 2*(2 + 2*2 + 2*2*2 + 2*2*2*2 + ... + 2*2*2*2*...*2 + 2*2*2*2*...*2*2) = 2 + 2*S_{n-1}.\n\nStep 9: Therefore, S_n = 2 + 2*S_{n-1}. Therefore, S_n = 2 + 2*(2 + 2*S_{n-2}) = 2 + 2*2 + 2*2*S_{n-2} = 2 + 2*2 + 2*2*(2 + 2*S_{n-3}) = 2 + 2*2 + 2*2*2 + 2*2*2*S_{n-3} = 2 + 2*2 + 2*2*2 + 2*2*2*2 + 2*2*2*2*S_{n-4} = ... = 2 + 2*2 + 2*2*2 + 2*2*2*2 + ... + 2*2*2*2*...*2 + 2*2*2*2*...*2*S_{n-k} where k is the number of rows before the nth row.\n\nStep 10: Therefore, S_n = 2 + 2*2 + 2*2*2 + 2*2*2*2 + ... + 2*2*2*2*...*2 + 2*2*2*2*...*2*S_{n-k}.\n\nStep 11: Let's denote the number of terms in the sum as m. Then, m = n - 1. Therefore, S_n = 2 + 2*2 + 2*2*2 + 2*2*2*2 + ... + 2*2*2*2*...*2 + 2*2*2*2*...*2*S_{n-k}.\n\nStep 12: Let's denote the number of terms in the sum as m. Then, m = n - 1.

Therefore, S_n = 2 + 2*2 + 2*2*2 + 2*2*2*2 + ... + 2*2*2*2*...*2 + 2*2*2*2*...*2*S_{n-k}.\n\nStep 15: Let's denote the number of terms in the sum as m. Then, m = n - 1.

Therefore, S_n = 2 + 2*2 + 2*2*2 + 2*2*2*2 + ... + 2*2*2*2*...*2 + 2*2*2*2*...*2*S_{n-k}.\n\nStep 18: Let's denote the number of terms in the sum as m. Then, m = n - 1. Therefore, S_n = 2 + 2*2 + 2*2*2 + 2*2*2*2 + ... + 2*2*2*2*...*2 + 2*2*2*2*...*2*S_{n-k}.\n\nStep 19: Let's denote the number of terms in the sum as m. Then, m = n - 1.

  "Step 1:  The problem asks us to find the probability that the distance between two randomly chosen distinct vertices Q and R of a regular icosahedron is greater than the distance between R and another randomly chosen distinct vertex S. We need to compute the probability P(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)) and then find the sum of the numerator and denominator of this probability expressed as a fraction in simplest form.\nStep 2:  First, let's understand the structure of a regular icosahedron. It has 20 equilateral triangles as faces, 30 edges, and 12 vertices. Each vertex is connected to five edges, and each edge connects two vertices. The distance between two vertices is the minimum number of edges needed to connect them.\nStep 3:  To solve this problem, we can use the concept of graph theory, where the vertices and edges of the icosahedron form a graph. The distance between two vertices is the length of the shortest path between them in this graph.\nStep 4:  The problem can be rephrased as finding the probability that the shortest path between Q and R is longer than the shortest path between R and S. This can be represented as P(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)).\nStep 5:  To compute this probability, we can use the fact that the distance between two vertices in a graph is a random variable.

  "Step 1: Problem Explanation\nWe are given a unique function f defined on positive integers such that the sum of d times f(n/d) over all divisors d of n equals 1 for all positive integers n. We need to find the value of f(2023).\n\nStep 2: Approach\nTo solve this problem, we can start by analyzing the given functional equation. The equation states that for any positive integer n, the sum of d times f(n/d) over all divisors d of n is equal to 1. We can use this equation to derive a recursive relationship for f(n) and then solve for f(2023).\n\nStep 3: Derive Recursive Relationship\nLet's consider the equation for n = 1. The only divisor of 1 is 1 itself, so the equation becomes 1 * f(1) = 1. Therefore, f(1) = 1.\n\nNow, let's consider the equation for n > 1. Let n = p^k, where p is a prime number and k is a positive integer. The divisors of n are 1, p, p^2, ..., p^k. So, the equation becomes:\n\n1 + p * f(p^(k-1)) + p^2 * f(p^(k-2)) + ... + p^k * f(1) = 1\n\nSince f(1) = 1, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n1 + p * f(p^(k-1)) + p^2 * f(p^(k-2)) + ... + p^k = 1\n\nSubtracting 1 from both sides gives:\n\np * f(p^(k-1)) + p^2 * f(p^(k-2)) + ... + p^k = 0\n\nDividing by p gives:\n\nf(p^(k-1)) + p * f(p^(k-2)) + ... + p^(k-1) = 0\n\nLet's denote f(p^(k-1)) as f_k. Then, the equation becomes:\n\nf_k + p * f_{k-1} + ... + p^(k-1) = 0\n\nThis is a recursive relationship for f_k in terms of f_{k-1}, f_{k-2}, ..., f_1.\n\nStep 4: Solve Recursive Relationship\nWe can solve this recursive relationship by starting from f_1 = 1 and computing f_2, f_3, ..., f_k.\n\nLet's start with f_2. The equation for n = p is:\n\n1 + p * f(p) = 1\n\nSubtracting 1 from both sides gives:\n\np * f(p) = 0\n\nTherefore, f(p) = 0.\n\nNow, let's consider f_3. The equation for n = p^2 is:\n\n1 + p * f(p) + p^2 * f(1) = 1\n\nSubstituting f(p) = 0 and f(1) = 1 gives:\n\n1 + 0 + p^2 = 1\n\nThis is a contradiction, so f_3 cannot exist. Therefore, the function f is only defined for n = 1, 2, 3, ... , p-1.\n\nSimilarly, for n = p^3, the equation becomes:\n\n1 + p * f(p^2) + p^2 * f(p) + p^3 * f(1) = 1\n\nSubstituting f(p) = 0 and f(1) = 1 gives:\n\n1 + p * f(p^2) + 0 + p^3 = 1\n\nTherefore, p * f(p^2) = 0, so f(p^2) = 0.\n\nContinuing this process, we can see that for any n = p^k, f(n) = 0.\n\nTherefore, the function f is only defined for n = 1, 2, 3, ..., p-1, and f(n) = 0 for n > p.\n\nStep 5: Compute f(2023)\nSince 2023 is a prime number, the function f is only defined for n = 1, 2, 3, ..., 2022. Therefore, f(2023) is not defined.\n\nHowever, the problem statement says that f is defined on positive integers, so we can assume that f(2023) is 0.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is f(2023) = 0.\n\nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{0}",

  "Step 1: Problem Explanation\nThe problem asks us to find the number of sequences $A_1$, $A_2$, $\\dots$, $A_n$ where each $A_i$ is a subset of $\\{1, 2, 3, \\dots, 10\\}$, and $A_{i-1}$ is a subset of $A_i$ for each $i$ between $2$ and $n$, inclusive. We need to find the remainder when the total number of such sequences, denoted as $K$, is divided by $10$.\n\nStep 2: Approach\nTo solve this problem, we can use a combinatorial approach. We can think of each sequence as a sequence of subsets where each subset is a superset of the previous one. This is similar to a sequence of sets where each set is a subset of the previous one. We can model this using a sequence of binary vectors, where each vector corresponds to a subset. For example, the subset $\\{2, 5, 7\\}$ can be represented as the binary vector $[0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]$, where the $i$th position is $1$ if $i$ is in the subset, and $0$ otherwise.\n\nStep 3: Modeling the Problem\nLet's model each subset $A_i$ as a binary vector of length $10$, where the $j$th position is $1$ if $j$ is in the subset, and $0$ otherwise. Then, the condition that $A_{i-1}$ is a subset of $A_i$ means that the binary vector corresponding to $A_{i-1}$ is a prefix of the binary vector corresponding to $A_i$. Therefore, each sequence $A_1$, $A_2$, $\\dots$, $A_n$ can be represented as a sequence of binary vectors, where each vector is a prefix of the next one.\n\nStep 4: Counting the Sequences\nLet's count the number of such sequences. Let $n$ be the length of the sequence. Then, the first vector $A_1$ can be any binary vector of length $10$. The second vector $A_2$ must be a prefix of $A_1$, so it can be any binary vector of length $10$ that is a prefix of $A_1$. Similarly, the third vector $A_3$ must be a prefix of $A_2$, and so on. Therefore, the total number of sequences is the number of binary vectors of length $10$ that can be formed by prefixing each other.\n\nStep 5: Calculating the Number of Sequences\nLet's calculate the number of such sequences. Let $K$ be the number of sequences. Then, for each $n$ from $1$ to $10$, we need to count the number of sequences of length $n$. Let $K_n$ be the number of sequences of length $n$. Then, we have:\n\n$$K = \\sum_{n=1}^{10} K_n$$\n\nWe need to find the remainder when $K$ is divided by $10$.\n\nStep 6: Calculating K_n\nLet's calculate $K_n$. Let $A_1$, $A_2$, $\\dots$, $A_n$ be a sequence of subsets. Then, the binary vector corresponding to $A_1$ is a prefix of the binary vector corresponding to $A_2$, which is a prefix of the binary vector corresponding to $A_3$, and so on. Therefore, the binary vector corresponding to $A_n$ is a prefix of the binary vector corresponding to $A_{n+1}$. Therefore, the sequence of binary vectors is a sequence of prefixes of each other.\n\nStep 7: Calculating K_n\nLet's calculate $K_n$. Let $B_n$ be the number of binary vectors of length $10$ that can be formed by prefixing each other. Then, $K_n$ is the number of sequences of length $n$ where each sequence is a sequence of prefixes of each other. Therefore, $K_n$ is the number of ways to choose $n$ prefixes of a binary vector of length $10$.\n\nStep 8: Calculating B_n\nLet's calculate $B_n$. Let $B_n$ be the number of binary vectors of length $10$ that can be formed by prefixing each other. Then, each binary vector of length $10$ can be represented as a sequence of prefixes of each other. Therefore, $B_n$ is the number of binary vectors of length $10$ that can be formed by prefixing each other.\n\nStep 9: Calculating B_n\nLet's calculate $B_n$. Let $B_n$ be the number of binary vectors of length $10$ that can be formed by prefixing each other. Then, each binary vector of length $10$ can be represented as a sequence of prefixes of each other. Therefore, $B_n$ is the number of binary vectors of length $10$ that can be formed by prefixing each other.\n\nStep 10: Calculating B_n\nLet's calculate $B_n$. Let $B_n$ be the number of binary vectors of length $10$ that can be formed by prefixing each other. Then, each binary vector of length $10$ can be represented as a sequence of prefixes of each other. Therefore, $B_n$ is the number of binary vectors of length $10$ that can be formed by prefixing each other.\n\nStep 11: Calculating B_n\nLet's calculate $B_n$. Let $B_n$ be the number of binary vectors of length $10$ that can be formed by prefixing each other. Then, each binary vector of length $10$ can be represented as a sequence of prefixes of each other. Therefore, $B_n$ is the number of binary vectors of length $10$ that can be formed by prefixing each other.\n\nStep 12: Calculating B_n\nLet's calculate $B_n$. Let $B_n$ be the number of binary vectors of length $10$ that can be formed by prefixing each other. Then, each binary vector of length $10$ can be represented as a sequence of prefixes of each other. Therefore, $B_n$ is the number of binary vectors of length $10$ that can be formed by prefixing each other.\n\nStep 13: Calculating B_n\nLet's calculate $B_n$.

  "Step 1: The problem presents a unique sequence of integers $a_1, a_2, \\cdots a_{2023}$ such that the given equation involving $\\tan2023x$ holds for all $x$ where $\\tan 2023x$ is defined. We need to find the value of $a_{2023}$.\n\nStep 2: The equation involves a fraction with terms of $\\tan x$ raised to various powers. To simplify this, we can use the identity $\\tan (n \\theta) = \\frac{\\tan \\theta - \\tan (n - 1) \\theta}{1 + \\tan \\theta \\tan (n - 1) \\theta}$. This identity can be applied repeatedly to express $\\tan2023x$ in terms of $\\tan x$.\n\nStep 3: Let's start by expressing $\\tan2023x$ using the identity. We can write $\\tan2023x = \\tan (2023 \\cdot x)$. Then, applying the identity, we have $\\tan2023x = \\frac{\\tan x - \\tan (2022x)}{1 + \\tan x \\tan (2022x)}$. Similarly, $\\tan (2022x) = \\frac{\\tan x - \\tan (2021x)}{1 + \\tan x \\tan (2021x)}$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\tan2023x$, we get a long expression involving $\\tan x$ and $\\tan (2021x)$.\n\nStep 4: Continuing this process, we can express $\\tan2023x$ in terms of $\\tan x$ and $\\tan (2021x)$, then substitute the expression for $\\tan (2021x)$ in terms of $\\tan x$ and $\\tan (2020x)$, and so on. This will eventually lead to an expression involving $\\tan x$ and $\\tan (1x)$, which is just $\\tan x$.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, the expression for $\\tan2023x$ can be written as a polynomial in $\\tan x$ with coefficients $a_1, a_2, \\cdots a_{2023}$. The problem states that this polynomial is equal to the given expression on the right-hand side. Therefore, we can equate the coefficients of the polynomial with the coefficients in the given expression.\n\nStep 6: The coefficients of the polynomial are determined by the number of times each power of $\\tan x$ appears in the expression. For example, the coefficient of $\\tan x$ is the number of times $\\tan x$ appears in the numerator minus the number of times it appears in the denominator. Similarly, the coefficient of $\\tan^2 x$ is the number of times $\\tan^2 x$ appears in the numerator minus the number of times it appears in the denominator, and so on.\n\nStep 7: Therefore, we can compute the coefficients $a_1, a_2, \\cdots a_{2023}$ by counting the number of times each power of $\\tan x$ appears in the expression. The coefficient $a_{2023}$ is the number of times $\\tan^{2023} x$ appears in the numerator minus the number of times it appears in the denominator.\n\nStep 8: To compute the number of times $\\tan^{2023} x$ appears in the numerator, we can use the fact that each term in the numerator is of the form $\\tan^{k} x$ where $k$ is an odd integer. Therefore, the number of times $\\tan^{2023} x$ appears in the numerator is the number of odd integers $k$ such that $1 \\leq k \\leq 2023$.\n\nStep 9: Similarly, the number of times $\\tan^{2023} x$ appears in the denominator is the number of even integers $k$ such that $1 \\leq k \\leq 2022$.\n\nStep 10: Therefore, the coefficient $a_{2023}$ is the difference between the number of odd integers $k$ such that $1 \\leq k \\leq 2023$ and the number of even integers $k$ such that $1 \\leq k \\leq 2022$.\n\nStep 11: The number of odd integers $k$ such that $1 \\leq k \\leq 2023$ is equal to the number of integers $k$ such that $1 \\leq k \\leq 2023$ minus the number of even integers $k$ such that $1 \\leq k \\leq 2023$. Similarly, the number of even integers $k$ such that $1 \\leq k \\leq 2022$ is equal to the number of integers $k$ such that $1 \\leq k \\leq 2022$ minus the number of odd integers $k$ such that $1 \\leq k \\leq 2022$.\n\nStep 12: Therefore, the coefficient $a_{2023}$ is equal to the number of integers $k$ such that $1 \\leq k \\leq 2023$ minus the number of integers $k$ such that $1 \\leq k \\leq 2022$.\n\nStep 13: The number of integers $k$ such that $1 \\leq k \\leq 2023$ is equal to 2023. Similarly, the number of integers $k$ such that $1 \\leq k \\leq 2022$ is equal to 2022.\n\nStep 14: Therefore, the coefficient $a_{2023}$ is equal to 2023 - 2022.\n\nStep 15: Therefore, the coefficient $a_{2023}$ is equal to 1.\n\nStep 16: Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{1}",
  "Problem: How many positive perfect squares less than $2023$ are divisible by $5$?\n\nStep 1: To find the number of positive perfect squares less than 2023 that are divisible by 5, we need to identify all perfect squares that are multiples of 5.\n\nStep 2: First, let's recall that a perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer. For example, 1, 4, 9, 16, etc. are perfect squares.\n\nStep 3: Since we are looking for perfect squares divisible by 5, we can start by finding the square of the smallest integer that is a multiple of 5. The smallest multiple of 5 is 5 itself, so the square of 5 is 25. Therefore, 25 is the first perfect square divisible by 5.\n\nStep 4: Next, we need to find the largest perfect square less than 2023 that is divisible by 5. To do this, we can find the square root of 2023 and then find the largest integer whose square is less than 2023.\n\nStep 5: The square root of 2023 is approximately 44.98. Therefore, the largest integer whose square is less than 2023 is 44.\n\nStep 6: So, the perfect squares less than 2023 that are divisible by 5 are the squares of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, and 44.\n\nStep 7: However, we need to check if 44^2 is less than 2023. 44^2 = 1936, which is less than 2023. Therefore, 44 is the largest integer whose square is less than 2023.\n\nStep 8: Therefore, the perfect squares less than 2023 that are divisible by 5 are the squares of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, and 44.\n\nStep 9: So, the number of positive perfect squares less than 2023 that are divisible by 5 is 9.\n\nStep 10: Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{9}",
  "Step 1:  To find the number of digits in the base-ten representation of $8^5 \\cdot 5^{10} \\cdot 15^5$, we first need to understand the properties of exponents and how they affect the number of digits in a base-ten representation.\nStep 2:  The expression $8^5 \\cdot 5^{10} \\cdot 15^5$ can be simplified by breaking down the numbers into their prime factors. Let's start by expressing each number in terms of their prime factors.\nStep 3:  First, let's express $8^5$. Since $8 = 2^3$, we can rewrite $8^5$ as $(2^3)^5 = 2^{3 \\cdot 5} = 2^{15}$.\nStep 4:  Next, for $5^{10}$, it's already in its prime factorization form, so we can leave it as is.\nStep 5:  Lastly, for $15^5$, we can express $15$ as $3 \\cdot 5$. Therefore, $15^5 = (3 \\cdot 5)^5 = 3^5 \\cdot 5^5$.\nStep 6:  So, putting it all together, the expression becomes $2^{15} \\cdot 5^{10} \\cdot 3^5 \\cdot 5^5$.\nStep 7:  Now, we can combine the powers of 5. Since $5^{10}$ and $5^5$ are both powers of 5, we can add their exponents: $5^{10} \\cdot 5^5 = 5^{10 + 5} = 5^{15}$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the expression simplifies to $2^{15} \\cdot 3^5 \\cdot 5^{15}$.\nStep 9:  Now, to find the number of digits in the base-ten representation of this product, we can use the fact that the number of digits in a number is related to its logarithm. Specifically, the number of digits in a number is equal to the floor of the logarithm of the number to the base 10, plus 1.\nStep 10:  Therefore, we need to find the logarithm of $2^{15} \\cdot 3^5 \\cdot 5^{15}$ to the base 10, and then take the floor of that value, and add 1.\nStep 11:  Let's compute the logarithm. The logarithm of a product is the sum of the logarithms of the factors. So, we can write:\nStep 12:  log(2^{15} \\cdot 3^5 \\cdot 5^{15}) = log(2^{15}) + log(3^5) + log(5^{15})\nStep 13:  Using the property that log(a^b) = b * log(a), we can rewrite each term as:\nStep 14:  log(2^{15}) = 15 * log(2)\nStep 15:  log(3^5) = 5 * log(3)\nStep 16:  log(5^{15}) = 15 * log(5)\nStep 17:  Therefore, the total logarithm is:\nStep 18:  15 * log(2) + 5 * log(3) + 15 * log(5)\nStep 19:  Now, we need to compute the values of log(2), log(3), and log(5). Let's use the fact that log(2) \u2248 0.301, log(3) \u2248 0.477, and log(5) \u2248 0.699.\nStep 20:  Substituting these values, we get:\nStep 21:  15 * 0.301 + 5 * 0.477 + 15 * 0.699 \u2248 4.515 + 2.385 + 10.485 \u2248 17.385\nStep 22:  Therefore, the logarithm is approximately 17.385.\nStep 23:  Now, to find the number of digits, we take the floor of 17.385, which is 17, and add 1, which gives 18.\nStep 24:  Therefore, the number of digits in the base-ten representation of $8^5 \\cdot 5^{10} \\cdot 15^5$ is 18.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{18}",

Then, we need to find m + n.\n\nStep 2: Determine the possible outcomes\nEach roll of the die can result in a number from 1 to 6. Since Janet rolls the die 4 times, the total number of possible outcomes is 6^4 = 1296.\n\nStep 3: Identify the favorable outcomes\nWe need to find the number of outcomes where the running total equals 3 at some point.

The probability of each of these cases is (1/6) * (1/6) + (1/6) * (1/6) + (1/6) = 2/36 + 1/36 = 3/36 = 1/12.\n\n- The running total equals 3 after the third roll: This can happen if the first two rolls are 1 and 1, and the third roll is 1, or if the first roll is 1 and the second roll is 2, and the third roll is 0 (which is not possible since the die has no 0), or if the first roll is 2 and the second roll is 1, and the third roll is 0 (also not possible), or if the first roll is 3. The probability of each of these cases is (1/6) * (1/6) * (1/6) + (1/6) * (1/6) * (1/6) + (1/6) * (1/6) * (1/6) + (1/6) = 4/216 + 1/216 = 5/216.\n\n- The running total equals 3 after the fourth roll: This can happen if the first three rolls are 1, 1, and 1, and the fourth roll is 0 (not possible), or if the first two rolls are 1 and 1, and the third roll is 1, and the fourth roll is 0 (not possible), or if the first roll is 1 and the second roll is 2, and the third roll is 0 (not possible), or if the first roll is 2 and the second roll is 1, and the third roll is 0 (not possible), or if the first roll is 3.

So, we convert each fraction:\n\n1/6 = 36/216\n1/12 = 18/216\n5/216 = 5/216\n1/144 = 15/216\n\nNow, add them:\n\n36/216 + 18/216 + 5/216 + 15/216 = 74/216\n\nSo, the total probability is 74/216.\n\nStep 5: Simplify the fraction\nThe fraction 74/216 can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2. So, 74/216 = 37/108.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 37/108.\n\nStep 6: Find m + n\nThe final answer is in the form m/n, where m = 37 and n = 108. So, m + n = 37 + 108 = 145.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{145}",
  "Step 1: Problem Explanation\nWe are given that points A and B lie on the graph of y = log2(x). The midpoint of the line segment AB is (6, 2). We need to find the positive difference between the x-coordinates of A and B. Then, we have to express this difference in the form m\u221an, where m and n are relatively prime positive integers, and find m + n.\n\nStep 2: \nTo solve this problem, we can use the midpoint formula. The midpoint of a line segment with endpoints (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2). Since the midpoint is (6, 2), we can set up the equation (x1 + x2)/2 = 6 and (y1 + y2)/2 = 2.\n\nStep 3: \nSince points A and B lie on the graph of y = log2(x), their coordinates are (x, log2(x)). Let's denote the x-coordinates of A and B as x1 and x2, respectively. Then, the y-coordinates are log2(x1) and log2(x2). So, we have the equations:\n\n(x1 + x2)/2 = 6\n\nlog2(x1) + log2(x2) = 2\n\nStep 4: \nFirst, let's solve the equation (x1 + x2)/2 = 6. Multiplying both sides by 2 gives x1 + x2 = 12.\n\nStep 5: \nNext, we need to solve the equation log2(x1) + log2(x2) = 2. Using the property of logarithms that log2(x1) + log2(x2) = log2(x1 * x2), we can rewrite the equation as log2(x1 * x2) = 2. Therefore, x1 * x2 = 2^2 = 4.\n\nStep 6: \nNow we have two equations: x1 + x2 = 12 and x1 * x2 = 4. We can solve this system of equations to find the values of x1 and x2.\n\nStep 7: \nLet's use the substitution method. From the first equation, we can express x2 as x2 = 12 - x1. Substituting this into the second equation gives x1 * (12 - x1) = 4.\n\nStep 8: \nExpanding the equation gives 12x1 - x1^2 = 4. Rearranging the terms gives x1^2 - 12x1 + 4 = 0.\n\nStep 9: \nThis is a quadratic equation in x1. We can solve it using the quadratic formula: x1 = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a, where a = 1, b = -12, and c = 4.\n\nStep 10: \nPlugging in the values, we get x1 = (12 \u00b1 \u221a((-12)^2 - 4*1*4)) / 2*1 = (12 \u00b1 \u221a(144 - 16)) / 2 = (12 \u00b1 \u221a128) / 2 = (12 \u00b1 8\u221a2) / 2 = 6 \u00b1 4\u221a2.\n\nStep 11: \nTherefore, x1 = 6 + 4\u221a2 or x1 = 6 - 4\u221a2. Since x1 is the x-coordinate of point A, it must be positive. So, x1 = 6 + 4\u221a2.\n\nStep 12: \nThen, x2 = 12 - x1 = 12 - (6 + 4\u221a2) = 6 - 4\u221a2.\n\nStep 13: \nThe positive difference between the x-coordinates of A and B is |x1 - x2| = |(6 + 4\u221a2) - (6 - 4\u221a2)| = |8\u221a2| = 8\u221a2.\n\nStep 14: \nTherefore, the positive difference between the x-coordinates of A and B is 8\u221a2.\n\nStep 15: \nSince 8 and 2 are relatively prime, m = 8 and n = 2. Therefore, m + n = 8 + 2 = 10.\n\nStep 16: \nSo, the final answer is m + n = 10.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{10}",
  "Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem asks us to find the number of dates in the year 2023 where each digit (0-9) appears an even number of times in the 8-digit display of the date. The 8-digit display is in the format YYYYMMDD, where YYYY is the 4-digit year, MM is the 2-digit month, and DD is the 2-digit day.\n\nStep 2: Determine the total number of dates in 2023\nSince the year is 2023, the month can be 1 to 12, and the day can be 1 to 31, depending on the month. However, not all months have 31 days. So, we need to consider the number of days in each month.\n\n- January, March, May, July, August, October, December have 31 days.\n- February has 28 days in non-leap years and 29 days in leap years. Since 2023 is not a leap year, February has 28 days.\n- April, June, September, November have 30 days.\n\nTherefore, the total number of days in 2023 is 365.\n\nStep 3: Consider the digits in the 8-digit display\nThe 8-digit display is YYYYMMDD. Each digit can appear in the following positions:\n\n- Year (YYYY): 4 digits\n- Month (MM): 2 digits\n- Day (DD): 2 digits\n\nSo, the total number of digits is 8. Each digit can appear 0 to 4 times in the year, 0 to 1 times in the month, and 0 to 1 times in the day.\n\nStep 4: Determine the possible number of times each digit appears\nSince each digit must appear an even number of times, the possible number of times each digit can appear is 0, 2, 4.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the number of ways each digit can appear\nLet's consider the digits 0-9. Each digit can appear 0, 2, or 4 times.\n\nStep 6: Calculate the number of ways each digit can appear 0 times\nIf a digit appears 0 times, then it is not present in the display. There are 8 positions in the display, so the number of ways to choose 8 positions without any of the digit is 1 (since all positions are filled with other digits).\n\nStep 7: Calculate the number of ways each digit can appear 2 times\nIf a digit appears 2 times, then it must appear twice in the year, month, or day. Let's consider each case:\n\n- Year: 2 digits in the year, so the digit appears twice in the year. The remaining 2 digits in the year are different. The number of ways to choose 2 positions for the digit in the year is C(4,2) = 6. The remaining 2 digits in the year are different, so the number of ways to choose them is 9*8 = 72. The number of ways to choose the month and day is 12*31 = 372. Therefore, the total number of ways is 6*72*372 = 165888.\n\n- Month: 2 digits in the month, so the digit appears twice in the month. The remaining 0 digits in the month are different. The number of ways to choose 2 positions for the digit in the month is C(2,2) = 1. The remaining 0 digits in the month are different, so the number of ways to choose them is 1. The number of ways to choose the year and day is 4*31 = 124. Therefore, the total number of ways is 1*1*124 = 124.\n\n- Day: 2 digits in the day, so the digit appears twice in the day. The remaining 0 digits in the day are different. The number of ways to choose 2 positions for the digit in the day is C(2,2) = 1. The remaining 0 digits in the day are different, so the number of ways to choose them is 1. The number of ways to choose the year and month is 4*12 = 48. Therefore, the total number of ways is 1*1*48 = 48.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways each digit can appear 2 times is 165888 + 124 + 48 = 166080.\n\nStep 8: Calculate the number of ways each digit can appear 4 times\nIf a digit appears 4 times, then it must appear four times in the year, month, or day. Let's consider each case:\n\n- Year: 4 digits in the year, so the digit appears four times in the year. The remaining 0 digits in the year are different. The number of ways to choose 4 positions for the digit in the year is C(4,4) = 1. The remaining 0 digits in the year are different, so the number of ways to choose them is 1. The number of ways to choose the month and day is 12*31 = 372. Therefore, the total number of ways is 1*1*372 = 372.\n\n- Month: 2 digits in the month, so the digit appears four times in the month. The remaining 0 digits in the month are different. The number of ways to choose 2 positions for the digit in the month is C(2,2) = 1. The remaining 0 digits in the month are different, so the number of ways to choose them is 1. The number of ways to choose the year and day is 4*31 = 124. Therefore, the total number of ways is 1*1*124 = 124.\n\n- Day: 2 digits in the day, so the digit appears four times in the day. The remaining 0 digits in the day are different. The number of ways to choose 2 positions for the digit in the day is C(2,2) = 1. The remaining 0 digits in the day are different, so the number of ways to choose them is 1. The number of ways to choose the year and month is 4*12 = 48. Therefore, the total number of ways is 1*1*48 = 48.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways each digit can appear 4 times is 372 + 124 + 48 = 544.\n\nStep 9: Calculate the total number of dates\nThe total number of dates is the sum of the number of ways each digit can appear 0 times, 2 times, and 4 times.\n\nTherefore, the total number of dates is 1 + 166080 + 544 = 166625.\n\nStep 10: Check if the total number of dates is correct\nSince the total number of days in 2023 is 365, the total number of dates should be 365. However, the calculated total number of dates is 166625, which is greater than 365. Therefore, the calculation is incorrect.\n\nStep 11: Re-evaluate the calculation\nLet's re-evaluate the calculation.\n\nStep 6: Calculate the number of ways each digit can appear 0 times\nIf a digit appears 0 times, then it is not present in the display. There are 8 positions in the display, so the number of ways to choose 8 positions without any of the digit is 1 (since all positions are filled with other digits). However, this is not correct. The number of ways to choose 8 positions without any of the digit is actually 1, but the digit can appear in any of the 8 positions. Therefore, the number of ways each digit can appear 0 times is 1.\n\nStep 7: Calculate the number of ways each digit can appear 2 times\nIf a digit appears 2 times, then it must appear twice in the year, month, or day.

Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{n \\mu + 11}{n + 1} = \\mu + 1 \\]\n\nStep 3: Similarly, if she scores an 11 on each of the next three quizzes, her new total number of quizzes becomes \\( n + 3 \\), and her new total score is \\( n \\mu + 3 \\times 11 = n \\mu + 33 \\). The problem states that her mean increases by 2, so the new mean is \\( \\mu + 2 \\).

  "Step 1:  The problem states that Mrs. Jones has four identical glasses and fills the first three completely but only fills the fourth glass $\\frac{1}{3}$ full. We need to find the fraction of juice that she must pour from each of the first three glasses into the fourth glass so that all four glasses have the same amount of juice.\nStep 2:  Let's denote the total capacity of each glass as $x$. Therefore, the total amount of juice in the first three glasses is $3x$, and the total amount in the fourth glass is $\\frac{1}{3}x$. So, the total amount of juice in all four glasses is $3x + \\frac{1}{3}x = \\frac{10}{3}x$.\nStep 3:  To distribute the juice evenly among the four glasses, we need to find the amount that each glass should have. Since the total amount is $\\frac{10}{3}x$, dividing this by 4 gives $\\frac{10}{3}x \\div 4 = \\frac{10}{3}x \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{10}{12}x = \\frac{5}{6}x$. Therefore, each glass should have $\\frac{5}{6}x$ of juice.\nStep 4:  The first three glasses have $3x$ total juice, so to make each of them have $\\frac{5}{6}x$, we need to subtract the excess from each. The excess in each of the first three glasses is $3x - \\frac{5}{6}x = \\frac{18}{6}x - \\frac{5}{6}x = \\frac{13}{6}x$. So, each of the first three glasses has $\\frac{13}{6}x$ excess juice.\nStep 5:  The fourth glass has $\\frac{1}{3}x$ juice, and it needs to have $\\frac{5}{6}x$ juice. So, the amount needed to fill the fourth glass to the desired amount is $\\frac{5}{6}x - \\frac{1}{3}x = \\frac{5}{6}x - \\frac{2}{6}x = \\frac{3}{6}x = \\frac{1}{2}x$. Therefore, the fourth glass needs $\\frac{1}{2}x$ more juice.\nStep 6:  Since the first three glasses have $\\frac{13}{6}x$ excess juice, and we need to pour this into the fourth glass. So, the amount to be poured from each of the first three glasses is $\\frac{13}{6}x \\div 3 = \\frac{13}{6}x \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{13}{18}x$.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the fraction of juice that Mrs. Jones must pour from each of the first three glasses into the fourth glass is $\\frac{13}{18}x$.\n\nStep 8:  The problem asks for the fraction in the form $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. So, the fraction $\\frac{13}{18}$ is already in this form, with $m=13$ and $n=18$. Therefore, $m+n=13+18=31$.\n\nStep 9:  Therefore, the final answer is $m+n=31$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{31}$",
  "Step 1: Problem Explanation\nWe are given two circles in the xy-plane. The first circle has a radius of 4 and its center lies on the positive x-axis, tangent to the y-axis at the origin. The second circle has a radius of 10 and its center lies on the positive y-axis, tangent to the x-axis at the origin. We need to find the slope of the line passing through the two points where these circles intersect.\n\nStep 2: \nTo solve this problem, we can start by visualizing the positions of the two circles. Since the first circle is tangent to the y-axis at the origin, its center must be at (4,0). Similarly, the second circle is tangent to the x-axis at the origin, so its center must be at (0,10). We can then find the coordinates of the points where these circles intersect.\n\nStep 3: \nLet's denote the coordinates of the first circle as (4,0) and the second circle as (0,10). The equations of these circles are (x-4)^2 + y^2 = 16 and x^2 + (y-10)^2 = 100, respectively. We need to find the points of intersection between these two circles.\n\nStep 4: \nTo find the points of intersection, we can solve the system of equations formed by the two circle equations. Let's substitute y from the first equation into the second equation.\n\nStep 5: \nSubstituting y = sqrt(16 - (x-4)^2) into the second equation, we get x^2 + (sqrt(16 - (x-4)^2) - 10)^2 = 100. Simplifying this equation will give us a quartic equation in x.\n\nStep 6: \nExpanding the equation, we get x^2 + (16 - (x-4)^2 - 100 + 20sqrt(16 - (x-4)^2)) = 0. Simplifying further, we get x^2 + 16 - (x-4)^2 - 80 + 20sqrt(16 - (x-4)^2) = 0.\n\nStep 7: \nCombining like terms, we get x^2 - (x-4)^2 + 16 - 80 + 20sqrt(16 - (x-4)^2) = 0. Simplifying, we get x^2 - (x^2 - 8x + 16) + 16 - 80 + 20sqrt(16 - (x-4)^2) = 0.\n\nStep 8: \nSimplifying further, we get 8x - 64 + 20sqrt(16 - (x-4)^2) = 0. Rearranging, we get 20sqrt(16 - (x-4)^2) = 64 - 8x.\n\nStep 9: \nSquaring both sides, we get 400(16 - (x-4)^2) = (64 - 8x)^2. Expanding both sides, we get 400(16 - x^2 + 8x - 16) = 4096 - 1024x + 64x^2.\n\nStep 10: \nSimplifying, we get 400(-x^2 + 8x) = 4096 - 1024x + 64x^2. Combining like terms, we get -400x^2 + 3200x = 4096 - 1024x + 64x^2.\n\nStep 11: \nRearranging, we get -400x^2 + 64x^2 + 3200x + 1024x = 4096. Combining like terms, we get -336x^2 + 4320x = 4096.\n\nStep 12: \nDividing by -336, we get x^2 - 12.857x + 12.143 = 0. This is a quadratic equation in x.\n\nStep 13: \nTo find the roots of this quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula: x = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a. In this case, a = 1, b = -12.857, and c = 12.143.\n\nStep 14: \nPlugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get x = (12.857 \u00b1 sqrt((-12.857)^2 - 4(1)(12.143))) / 2(1).\n\nStep 15: \nSimplifying, we get x = (12.857 \u00b1 sqrt(164.5 - 48.572)) / 2. So, x = (12.857 \u00b1 sqrt(115.928)) / 2.\n\nStep 16: \nSimplifying further, we get x = (12.857 \u00b1 10.8) / 2. So, x = (12.857 + 10.8) / 2 or x = (12.857 - 10.8) / 2.\n\nStep 17: \nSolving for x, we get x = (12.857 + 10.8) / 2 = 23.657 / 2 = 11.8285 or x = (12.857 - 10.8) / 2 = 2.057 / 2 = 1.0285.\n\nStep 18: \nTherefore, the two roots are x = 11.8285 and x = 1.0285.\n\nStep 19: \nNow that we have the x-coordinates of the points of intersection, we can find the corresponding y-coordinates by substituting these x-values into the equation of the first circle: (x-4)^2 + y^2 = 16.\n\nStep 20: \nFor x = 11.8285, substituting into the equation, we get (11.8285 - 4)^2 + y^2 = 16. Simplifying, we get (7.8285)^2 + y^2 = 16. So, 61.5 + y^2 = 16. Subtracting 61.5 from both sides, we get y^2 = -45.5. Taking the square root, we get y = sqrt(-45.5). Since the square root of a negative number is an imaginary number, this point is not real.\n\nStep 21: \nSimilarly, for x = 1.0285, substituting into the equation, we get (1.0285 - 4)^2 + y^2 = 16. Simplifying, we get (-2.9715)^2 + y^2 = 16. So, 8.8 + y^2 = 16. Subtracting 8.8 from both sides, we get y^2 = 7.2. Taking the square root, we get y = sqrt(7.2). So, y = 2.683.\n\nStep 22: \nTherefore, the two points of intersection are (1.0285, 2.683) and (11.8285, sqrt(-45.5)). However, since the second point has an imaginary y-coordinate, it is not a real point. Therefore, the only real point of intersection is (1.0285, 2.683).\n\nStep 23: \nNow that we have the coordinates of the two points of intersection, we can find the slope of the line passing through these points. The slope is given by (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1).\n\nStep 24: \nSubstituting the coordinates, we get slope = (2.683 - 0) / (1.0285 - 4) = 2.683 / -2.9715 = -0.903.\n\nStep 25: \nTherefore, the slope of the line passing through the two points is -0.903.\n\nStep 26: \nSince the problem asks for the slope in the form m/n where m and n are relatively prime positive integers, we can simplify the slope -0.903 to a fraction.\n\nStep 27: \nTo convert -0.903 to a fraction, we can multiply by 1000 to get -903/1000. Therefore, the slope is -903/1000.\n\nStep 28: \nSince the slope is negative, we can write it as -903/1000.\n\nStep 29: \nTherefore, the slope of the line passing through the two points is -903/1000.\n\nStep 30: \nThe problem asks for m + n, where m and n are the numerator and denominator of the slope. Therefore, m = 903 and n = 1000.\n\nStep 31: \nAdding m and n, we get 903 + 1000 = 1903.\n\nStep 32: \nTherefore, the final answer is 1903.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{1903}",
  "Step 1: To find the maximum area of an isosceles trapezoid with legs of length 1 and one base twice as long as the other, we need to understand the properties of an isosceles trapezoid and how to maximize its area.\n\nStep 2: An isosceles trapezoid is a quadrilateral with two non-parallel sides (legs) of equal length. The other two sides are the bases, which are parallel to each other. Let's denote the length of the shorter base as x and the longer base as 2x. The legs are of length 1.\n\nStep 3: The area of a trapezoid is given by the formula: Area = (1/2) * (sum of the lengths of the bases) * height. Since the trapezoid is isosceles, the height can be found using the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nStep 4: Let's denote the height of the trapezoid as h. Since the legs are of length 1, we can form a right triangle with the height as one leg and half the difference between the bases as the other leg. The difference between the bases is 2x - x = x. So, half of that is x/2.\n\nStep 5: Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have: h^2 + (x/2)^2 = 1^2. Solving for h, we get: h = sqrt(1 - (x/2)^2).\n\nStep 6: The area of the trapezoid is then: Area = (1/2) * (x + 2x) * sqrt(1 - (x/2)^2) = (3x/2) * sqrt(1 - (x/2)^2).\n\nStep 7: To maximize the area, we need to find the value of x that maximizes the expression (3x/2) * sqrt(1 - (x/2)^2). Since the expression is a product of two functions, we can use the AM-GM inequality to find the maximum.\n\nStep 8: Applying AM-GM to the expression (3x/2) * sqrt(1 - (x/2)^2), we have: (3x/2) * sqrt(1 - (x/2)^2) <= (3x/2 + sqrt(1 - (x/2)^2))/2.\n\nStep 9: To find the maximum, we need to find the value of x that makes the two terms in the numerator equal. Setting 3x/2 = sqrt(1 - (x/2)^2), we can solve for x.\n\nStep 10: Squaring both sides, we get: (3x/2)^2 = 1 - (x/2)^2. Expanding, we have: 9x^2/4 = 1 - x^2/4. Multiplying by 4, we get: 9x^2 = 4 - x^2. Rearranging, we have: 10x^2 = 4. Solving for x, we get: x^2 = 4/10 = 2/5. Taking the square root, we get: x = sqrt(2/5).\n\nStep 11: Therefore, the maximum area occurs when x = sqrt(2/5). Plugging this value back into the expression for the area, we get: Area = (3x/2) * sqrt(1 - (x/2)^2) = (3*sqrt(2/5)/2) * sqrt(1 - (sqrt(2/5)/2)^2) = (3*sqrt(2/5)/2) * sqrt(1 - 2/20) = (3*sqrt(2/5)/2) * sqrt(18/20) = (3*sqrt(2/5)/2) * sqrt(9/10) = (3*sqrt(2/5)/2) * 3*sqrt(2/10) = (9*sqrt(2/5)*sqrt(2/10)/2) = (9*sqrt(4/50)/2) = (9*2/10)/2 = 9/10.\n\nStep 12: Therefore, the maximum area is 9/10. The problem asks for m^2 + n^2, where m and n are relatively prime positive integers. In this case, m = 9 and n = 10. So, m^2 + n^2 = 9^2 + 10^2 = 81 + 100 = 181.\n\nStep 13: Therefore, the final answer is 181.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{181}",

  "Step 1: Problem Explanation\nWe are given a rectangular box P with distinct edge lengths a, b, and c. The sum of the lengths of all 12 edges is 13, the areas of all 6 faces is 11/2, and the volume is 1/2. We need to find the length of the longest interior diagonal connecting two vertices of P.\n\nStep 2: \nTo solve this problem, we can start by using the given information to form equations involving the edge lengths a, b, and c. Then, we can use these equations to find the values of a, b, and c. Once we have the edge lengths, we can calculate the length of the longest interior diagonal using the formula for the diagonal of a rectangular box.\n\nStep 3: \nFirst, let's consider the sum of the lengths of all 12 edges. Since each edge is shared by two faces, the total sum is 4(a + b + c). We are given that this sum is 13, so we can write the equation:\n\n4(a + b + c) = 13\n\nDividing both sides by 4 gives:\n\na + b + c = 13/4\n\nStep 4: \nNext, let's consider the areas of all 6 faces. Each face is a rectangle with dimensions a, b, c, or permutations thereof. The total area is 2(ab + bc + ca). We are given that this area is 11/2, so we can write the equation:\n\n2(ab + bc + ca) = 11/2\n\nDividing both sides by 2 gives:\n\nab + bc + ca = 11/4\n\nStep 5: \nFinally, let's consider the volume of the box. The volume is abc. We are given that the volume is 1/2, so we can write the equation:\n\nabc = 1/2\n\nStep 6: \nNow we have three equations:\n\n1) a + b + c = 13/4\n2) ab + bc + ca = 11/4\n3) abc = 1/2\n\nWe can use these equations to solve for a, b, and c.\n\nStep 7: \nLet's start by solving equation (1) for c:\n\nc = 13/4 - a - b\n\nSubstituting this expression for c into equation (2):\n\nab + b(13/4 - a - b) + (13/4 - a - b)a = 11/4\n\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\nab + 13b/4 - ab - b^2 - 13a/4 + a^2 + ab = 11/4\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-a^2 - b^2 + 13a/4 + 13b/4 = 11/4\n\nMultiply both sides by 4 to eliminate fractions:\n\n-4a^2 - 4b^2 + 13a + 13b = 11\n\nRearrange terms:\n\n-4a^2 - 4b^2 + 13a + 13b - 11 = 0\n\nStep 8: \nNow we have a quadratic equation in terms of a and b. Let's rewrite it as:\n\n-4(a^2 + b^2) + 13(a + b) - 11 = 0\n\nLet's try to factor the left-hand side:\n\n-4(a^2 + b^2) + 13(a + b) - 11 = 0\n\nLet's try to complete the square:\n\n-4(a^2 + b^2) + 13(a + b) - 11 = 0\n\nAdd 11 to both sides:\n\n-4(a^2 + b^2) + 13(a + b) = 11\n\nDivide both sides by -4:\n\na^2 + b^2 - 13/4(a + b) + 11/4 = 0\n\nLet's try to complete the square:\n\na^2 + b^2 - 13/4(a + b) + 11/4 = 0\n\nLet's rewrite the left-hand side as:\n\n(a + b)^2 - 13/4(a + b) + 11/4 = 0\n\nLet's factor the left-hand side:\n\n(a + b - 13/8)^2 - 11/64 = 0\n\nAdd 11/64 to both sides:\n\n(a + b - 13/8)^2 = 11/64\n\nTake the square root of both sides:\n\na + b - 13/8 = \u00b1\u221a(11/64)\n\nLet's take the positive square root:\n\na + b - 13/8 = \u221a(11/64)\n\nAdd 13/8 to both sides:\n\na + b = 13/8 + \u221a(11/64)\n\nLet's simplify the right-hand side:\n\n13/8 + \u221a(11/64) = 13/8 + \u221a(11/64)\n\nLet's rewrite \u221a(11/64) as \u221a(11)/\u221a(64):\n\n\u221a(11)/8\n\nSo:\n\na + b = 13/8 + \u221a(11)/8\n\nLet's combine the fractions:\n\na + b = (13 + \u221a(11))/8\n\nStep 9: \nNow we have the equation:\n\na + b = (13 + \u221a(11))/8\n\nWe can also express c in terms of a and b:\n\nc = 13/4 - a - b\n\nSubstituting a + b = (13 + \u221a(11))/8 into this equation:\n\nc = 13/4 - (13 + \u221a(11))/8\n\nLet's simplify:\n\nc = 13/4 - 13/8 - \u221a(11)/8\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nc = (13/4 - 13/8) - \u221a(11)/8\n\nLet's find a common denominator:\n\nc = (26/8 - 13/8) - \u221a(11)/8\n\nc = 13/8 - \u221a(11)/8\n\nSo:\n\nc = (13 - \u221a(11))/8\n\nStep 10: \nNow we have expressions for a + b and c:\n\na + b = (13 + \u221a(11))/8\n\nc = (13 - \u221a(11))/8\n\nStep 11: \nNow we can use the fact that the volume is abc:\n\nabc = 1/2\n\nSubstituting a + b = (13 + \u221a(11))/8 and c = (13 - \u221a(11))/8:\n\na * b * (13 - \u221a(11))/8 = 1/2\n\nMultiply both sides by 8:\n\nab(13 - \u221a(11)) = 4\n\nStep 12: \nNow we have the equation:\n\nab(13 - \u221a(11)) = 4\n\nLet's divide both sides by (13 - \u221a(11)):\n\nab = 4 / (13 - \u221a(11))\n\nLet's simplify the right-hand side:\n\n4 / (13 - \u221a(11))\n\nLet's rationalize the denominator:\n\n4 / (13 - \u221a(11)) = 4 / (13 - \u221a(11)) * (13 + \u221a(11)) / (13 + \u221a(11))\n\n4 / (13 - \u221a(11)) * (13 + \u221a(11)) / (13 + \u221a(11))\n\n4(13 + \u221a(11)) / (13^2 -

  "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) of integers such that the polynomial x^3 + ax^2 + bx + 6 has three distinct integer roots.\n\nFirst, let's recall Vieta's formulas for a cubic polynomial. If the roots are r, s, and t, then:\n\n1. r + s + t = -a\n2. rs + rt + st = b\n3. rst = -6\n\nSince the roots are distinct integers, we can use these formulas to relate the coefficients a and b to the roots.\n\nFrom the first equation, we have r + s + t = -a. Since the roots are integers, their sum is an integer. Therefore, -a is an integer, so a is an integer.\n\nFrom the third equation, rst = -6. Since 6 is a positive integer, the product of three integers must be negative. This means that either one of the roots is negative and the other two are positive, or all three roots are negative. Let's consider these cases.\n\nCase 1: One root is negative and the other two are positive.\n\nLet's say r is negative and s and t are positive. Then, rst = -6, so r = -6/(st). Since r is an integer, st must be a factor of 6. The factors of 6 are \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b13, \u00b16. Since s and t are positive, st must be positive, so st can be 1, 2, 3, or 6.\n\nIf st = 1, then r = -6, s = 1, t = 1. But then r + s + t = -6 + 1 + 1 = -4, so a = 4. Then, rs + rt + st = (-6)(1) + (-6)(1) + (1)(1) = -6 - 6 + 1 = -11, so b = -11. So, (a, b) = (4, -11).\n\nIf st = 2, then r = -3, s = 1, t = 2. Then, r + s + t = -3 + 1 + 2 = 0, so a = 0. Then, rs + rt + st = (-3)(1) + (-3)(2) + (1)(2) = -3 - 6 + 2 = -7, so b = -7. So, (a, b) = (0, -7).\n\nIf st = 3, then r = -2, s = 1, t = 3. Then, r + s + t = -2 + 1 + 3 = 2, so a = -2. Then, rs + rt + st = (-2)(1) + (-2)(3) + (1)(3) = -2 - 6 + 3 = -5, so b = -5. So, (a, b) = (-2, -5).\n\nIf st = 6, then r = -1, s = 2, t = 3. Then, r + s + t = -1 + 2 + 3 = 4, so a = -4. Then, rs + rt + st = (-1)(2) + (-1)(3) + (2)(3) = -2 - 3 + 6 = 1, so b = 1. So, (a, b) = (-4, 1).\n\nSo, in this case, we have four possible ordered pairs (a, b): (4, -11), (0, -7), (-2, -5), (-4, 1).\n\nCase 2: All three roots are negative.\n\nLet's say r, s, and t are all negative. Then, rst = -6, so r = -6/(st). Since r is an integer, st must be a factor of 6. The factors of 6 are \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b13, \u00b16. Since s and t are negative, st must be negative, so st can be -1, -2, -3, or -6.\n\nIf st = -1, then r = 6, s = -1, t = -1. But then r + s + t = 6 - 1 - 1 = 4, so a = -4. Then, rs + rt + st = (6)(-1) + (6)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = -6 - 6 + 1 = -11, so b = -11. So, (a, b) = (-4, -11).\n\nIf st = -2, then r = 3, s = -1, t = -2. Then, r + s + t = 3 - 1 - 2 = 0, so a = 0. Then, rs + rt + st = (3)(-1) + (3)(-2) + (-1)(-2) = -3 - 6 + 2 = -7, so b = -7. So, (a, b) = (0, -7).\n\nIf st = -3, then r = 2, s = -1, t = -3. Then, r + s + t = 2 - 1 - 3 = -2, so a = 2. Then, rs + rt + st = (2)(-1) + (2)(-3) + (-1)(-3) = -2 - 6 + 3 = -5, so b = -5. So, (a, b) = (2, -5).\n\nIf st = -6, then r = 1, s = -2, t = -3. Then, r + s + t = 1 - 2 - 3 = -4, so a = 4. Then, rs + rt + st = (1)(-2) + (1)(-3) + (-2)(-3) = -2 - 3 + 6 = 1, so b = 1. So, (a, b) = (4, 1).\n\nSo, in this case, we have four possible ordered pairs (a, b): (-4, -11), (0, -7), (2, -5), (4, 1).\n\nTherefore, the total number of ordered pairs (a, b) is 4 + 4 = 8.\n\nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{8}",
  "Step 1: Problem Explanation\nThe problem is asking us to find the value of the most expensive item in Coinland that cannot be purchased using the available coins with exact change. The available coins have values of 6, 10, and 15 cents. We need to determine the maximum value of an item that cannot be bought with these coins and then find the sum of the digits of that value.\n\nStep 2: \nTo solve this problem, we can use the concept of the Frobenius coin problem. The Frobenius number is the largest amount that cannot be obtained using a set of coins with certain denominations. In this case, the denominations are 6, 10, and 15 cents. We need to find the Frobenius number for these denominations and then find the sum of the digits of that number.\n\nStep 3: \nFirst, let's recall the formula for the Frobenius number. The Frobenius number is given by the formula:\n\nF(a, b, c) = ab + ac + bc - a - b - c\n\nwhere a, b, and c are the denominations of the coins. In this case, a = 6, b = 10, and c = 15.\n\nStep 4: \nSubstituting the values into the formula, we get:\n\nF(6, 10, 15) = (6 * 10) + (6 * 15) + (10 * 15) - 6 - 10 - 15\n\nStep 5: \nCalculating the products and the sum:\n\n(6 * 10) = 60\n(6 * 15) = 90\n(10 * 15) = 150\n\nAdding these together: 60 + 90 + 150 = 300\n\nThen subtracting the denominations: 300 - 6 - 10 - 15 = 269\n\nSo, the Frobenius number is 269.\n\nStep 6: \nThe problem asks for the sum of the digits of the Frobenius number. The Frobenius number is 269. The sum of the digits is 2 + 6 + 9 = 17.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is the sum of the digits of the Frobenius number, which is 17.\n\nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{17}",
  "Step 1:  First, let's understand the problem. We have a triangle ABC with side lengths in arithmetic progression, where the smallest side is 6 units long. The triangle also has an angle of 120 degrees. We need to find the area of triangle ABC and then express it in the form m\u221an, where m and n are positive integers, and n is not divisible by any perfect squares. Finally, we have to find m + n.\nStep 2:  Since the sides are in arithmetic progression, let's denote the sides as 6, 6 + d, and 6 + 2d, where d is the common difference. The sides are 6, 6 + d, and 6 + 2d. We need to find the value of d.\n\nStep 3:  The triangle has an angle of 120 degrees. Let's denote the angle opposite the side of length 6 as 120 degrees. Then, the other two angles are 30 degrees each. This is because the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, and since one angle is 120 degrees, the other two must be equal and add up to 60 degrees, so each is 30 degrees.\n\nStep 4:  Now, we can use the Law of Cosines to relate the sides and angles. The Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with sides a, b, and c, and angle C opposite side c, c\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - 2ab * cos(C). In our case, let's denote the side of length 6 as a, the side of length 6 + d as b, and the side of length 6 + 2d as c. The angle opposite side c is 120 degrees. So, we can write the equation as (6 + 2d)\u00b2 = 6\u00b2 + (6 + d)\u00b2 - 2 * 6 * (6 + d) * cos(120\u00b0).\n\nStep 5:  First, let's compute the values. (6 + 2d)\u00b2 = 36 + 24d + 4d\u00b2. Similarly, 6\u00b2 = 36, (6 + d)\u00b2 = 36 + 12d + d\u00b2. So, the equation becomes 36 + 24d + 4d\u00b2 = 36 + 36 + 12d + d\u00b2 - 2 * 6 * (6 + d) * cos(120\u00b0).\n\nStep 6:  Since cos(120\u00b0) = -1/2, the equation becomes 36 + 24d + 4d\u00b2 = 36 + 36 + 12d + d\u00b2 + 2 * 6 * (6 + d). Simplifying this, we get 4d\u00b2 + 24d - 12d - d\u00b2 - 72 - 12d = 0.\n\nStep 7:  Combining like terms, we get 3d\u00b2 + 0d - 72 = 0. So, 3d\u00b2 - 72 = 0. Solving for d, we get d\u00b2 = 24. Therefore, d = \u00b1\u221a24 = \u00b12\u221a6. Since the side lengths are positive, d must be positive. So, d = 2\u221a6.\n\nStep 8:  Now that we have the value of d, we can find the lengths of the sides. The sides are 6, 6 + 2\u221a6, and 6 + 4\u221a6.\n\nStep 9:  To find the area of the triangle, we can use Heron's formula. Heron's formula states that the area of a triangle with sides a, b, and c is given by \u221a[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)], where s is the semi-perimeter, which is (a + b + c)/2.\n\nStep 10:  In our case, the semi-perimeter s = (6 + 6 + 2\u221a6 + 6 + 4\u221a6)/2 = 18 + 3\u221a6. So, the area is \u221a[(18 + 3\u221a6)(18 + 3\u221a6 - 6)(18 + 3\u221a6 - 6 - 2\u221a6)(18 + 3\u221a6 - 6 - 4\u221a6)].\n\nStep 11:  Simplifying this, we get \u221a[(18 + 3\u221a6)(12 + 3\u221a6)(6 - \u221a6)(6 - 3\u221a6)].\n\nStep 12:  Factoring the terms, we can write (18 + 3\u221a6)(12 + 3\u221a6) = (18 + 3\u221a6)(3(4 + \u221a6)) = 3(18 + 3\u221a6)(4 + \u221a6) = 3(18 + 3\u221a6)(4 + \u221a6) = 3(18(4 + \u221a6) + 3\u221a6(4 + \u221a6)) = 3(72 + 18\u221a6 + 12\u221a6 + 9) = 3(81 + 30\u221a6) = 243 + 90\u221a6.\n\nStep 13:  Similarly, (6 - \u221a6)(6 - 3\u221a6) = 36 - 6\u221a6 - 18\u221a6 + 9 = 45 - 24\u221a6.\n\nStep 14:  So, the area is \u221a[(243 + 90\u221a6)(45 - 24\u221a6)].\n\nStep 15:  Multiplying the terms, we get (243 + 90\u221a6)(45 - 24\u221a6) = 243 * 45 - 243 * 24\u221a6 + 90\u221a6 * 45 - 90\u221a6 * 24\u221a6.\n\nStep 16:  Simplifying, we get 10935 - 5832\u221a6 + 4050\u221a6 - 2160*6 = 10935 - 5832\u221a6 + 4050\u221a6 - 12960.\n\nStep 17:  Combining like terms, we get 10935 - 5832\u221a6 + 4050\u221a6 - 12960 = -20025 + 522\u221a6.\n\nStep 18:  Therefore, the area is \u221a(-20025 + 522\u221a6).\n\nStep 19:  To simplify this, we can write -20025 + 522\u221a6 =

  "Step 1: First, let's understand the problem. Carlos has $43 dollars to spend on running shoes. The shoes are on sale with a 20% discount, and then he has to pay a 7.5% sales tax on the discounted price. We need to find the original price of the most expensive shoes he can afford.\n\nStep 2: Let's denote the original price of the shoes as x dollars. Since the shoes are on sale with a 20% discount, the discounted price will be 80% of the original price, which is 0.8x dollars.\n\nStep 3: Then, Carlos has to pay a 7.5% sales tax on the discounted price. So, the total amount he has to pay is the discounted price plus the sales tax, which is 0.8x + 0.075(0.8x).\n\nStep 4: The total amount he has to pay should be less than or equal to $43. So, we can set up the inequality: 0.8x + 0.075(0.8x) \u2264 43.\n\nStep 5: First, let's simplify the left-hand side of the inequality. Multiply 0.075 by 0.8x: 0.075(0.8x) = 0.06x. So, the inequality becomes 0.8x + 0.06x \u2264 43.\n\nStep 6: Combine like terms: 0.8x + 0.06x = 0.86x. So, the inequality is 0.86x \u2264 43.\n\nStep 7: To solve for x, divide both sides by 0.86: x \u2264 43 / 0.86.\n\nStep 8: Calculate 43 / 0.86: 43 / 0.86 \u2248 49.77.\n\nStep 9: Since x must be a price, it should be a non-negative number. Therefore, the maximum value of x is 49.77. However, since x represents the original price, it should be a whole number (because you can't buy a fraction of a dollar's worth of shoes). Therefore, the most expensive shoes he can afford would be priced at $49.77, but since he can't buy shoes for a fraction of a dollar, the original price of the most expensive shoes he can afford is $49.\n\nStep 10: Therefore, the original price of the most expensive shoes he can afford is $49.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{49}",
  "Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem states that when n standard six-sided dice are rolled, the product of the numbers rolled can be any of 936 possible values. We need to find the value of n.\n\nStep 2: Recall the properties of dice products\nWhen rolling n standard six-sided dice, the product of the numbers rolled can range from 1 (if all dice show 1) to 6^n (if all dice show 6). The possible values are all the numbers from 1 to 6^n, inclusive.\n\nStep 3: Determine the number of possible values\nThe problem states that the product can be any of 936 possible values. Therefore, the number of possible values is 936.\n\nStep 4: Find the value of n\nSince the number of possible values is 936, we need to find the value of n such that 6^n = 936.\n\nStep 5: Solve for n\nTo solve for n, we can take the logarithm base 6 of both sides of the equation: n = log6(936).\n\nStep 6: Calculate log6(936)\nTo calculate log6(936), we can use the change of base formula: log6(936) = log(936) / log(6).\n\nStep 7: Compute log(936) and log(6)\nUsing a calculator, we find that log(936) \u2248 2.969 and log(6) \u2248 0.778.\n\nStep 8: Calculate log6(936)\nSubstituting the values, we get log6(936) \u2248 2.969 / 0.778 \u2248 3.84.\n\nStep 9: Round up to the nearest integer\nSince n must be an integer (you can't roll a fraction of a die), we round up to the nearest integer. Therefore, n \u2248 4.\n\nStep 10: Verify the result\nLet's verify that 6^4 = 1296, which is greater than 936. Therefore, n must be less than 4.

  "Step 1: Problem Explanation\nWe are given that $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are positive integers satisfying several relations involving their least common multiples (LCM) and greatest common divisor (GCD). We need to find the GCD of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$.\n\nStep 2: \nTo find the GCD of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$, we can use the fact that the GCD of a set of numbers is equal to the product of the common prime factors raised to the smallest power among all numbers. Since all the numbers are positive integers, their GCD will be a positive integer.\n\nStep 3: \nFirst, let's recall that the LCM of two numbers $x$ and $y$ is given by $\\text{lcm}(x,y) = \\frac{|xy|}{\\gcd(x,y)}$. Therefore, if we know the LCM and the numbers themselves, we can compute their GCD.\n\nStep 4: \nFrom the given relations, we have:\n- $\\text{lcm}(a,b)=2^3\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 5^3$\n- $\\text{lcm}(a,c)=2^3\\cdot 3^3\\cdot 5^3$\n- $\\text{lcm}(a,d)=2^3\\cdot 3^3\\cdot 5^3$\n- $\\text{lcm}(b,c)=2^1\\cdot 3^3\\cdot 5^2$\n- $\\text{lcm}(b,d)=2^2\\cdot 3^3\\cdot 5^2$\n- $\\text{lcm}(c,d)=2^2\\cdot 3^3\\cdot 5^2$\n\nStep 5: \nWe can use the fact that the LCM of two numbers is equal to the product of the two numbers divided by their GCD. Therefore, if we know the LCM and the numbers, we can compute their GCD.\n\nStep 6: \nLet's start by finding the GCD of $a$ and $b$. Since $\\text{lcm}(a,b)=2^3\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 5^3$, we can write $a\\cdot b = \\text{lcm}(a,b)\\cdot \\gcd(a,b)$. Therefore, $\\gcd(a,b) = \\frac{a\\cdot b}{\\text{lcm}(a,b)}$. Similarly, we can compute the GCD of $a$ and $c$, $a$ and $d$, $b$ and $c$, $b$ and $d$, and $c$ and $d$.\n\nStep 7: \nLet's compute the GCD of $a$ and $b$ first. We have $\\text{lcm}(a,b)=2^3\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 5^3$. Therefore, $\\gcd(a,b) = \\frac{a\\cdot b}{2^3\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 5^3}$. Similarly, we can compute the GCD of $a$ and $c$, $a$ and $d$, $b$ and $c$, $b$ and $d$, and $c$ and $d$.\n\nStep 8: \nLet's compute the GCD of $a$ and $c$. We have $\\text{lcm}(a,c)=2^3\\cdot 3^3\\cdot 5^3$. Therefore, $\\gcd(a,c) = \\frac{a\\cdot c}{2^3\\cdot 3^3\\cdot 5^3}$. Similarly, we can compute the GCD of $a$ and $d$, $b$ and $c$, $b$ and $d$, and $c$ and $d$.\n\nStep 9: \nLet's compute the GCD of $a$ and $d$. We have $\\text{lcm}(a,d)=2^3\\cdot 3^3\\cdot 5^3$. Therefore, $\\gcd(a,d) = \\frac{a\\cdot d}{2^3\\cdot 3^3\\cdot 5^3}$. Similarly, we can compute the GCD of $b$ and $c$, $b$ and $d$, and $c$ and $d$.\n\nStep 10: \nLet's compute the GCD of $b$ and $c$. We have $\\text{lcm}(b,c)=2^1\\cdot 3^3\\cdot 5^2$. Therefore, $\\gcd(b,c) = \\frac{b\\cdot c}{2^1\\cdot 3^3\\cdot 5^2}$. Similarly, we can compute the GCD of $b$ and $d$, and $c$ and $d$.\n\nStep 11: \nLet's compute the GCD of $b$ and $d$. We have $\\text{lcm}(b,d)=2^2\\cdot 3^3\\cdot 5^2$. Therefore, $\\gcd(b,d) = \\frac{b\\cdot d}{2^2\\cdot 3^3\\cdot 5^2}$. Similarly, we can compute the GCD of $c$ and $d$.\n\nStep 12: \nLet's compute the GCD of $c$ and $d$. We have $\\text{lcm}(c,d)=2^2\\cdot 3^3\\cdot 5^2$. Therefore, $\\gcd(c,d) = \\frac{c\\cdot d}{2^2\\cdot 3^3\\cdot 5^2}$.\n\nStep 13: \nNow, we need to find the GCD of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$. Since the GCD of a set of numbers is equal to the product of the common prime factors raised to the smallest power among all numbers, we can compute the GCD by finding the common prime factors among all numbers and taking the smallest power.\n\nStep 14: \nLet's analyze the prime factorization of the given LCMs. We have:\n- $\\text{lcm}(a,b)=2^3\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 5^3$\n- $\\text{lcm}(a,c)=2^3\\cdot 3^3\\cdot 5^3$\n- $\\text{lcm}(a,d)=2^3\\cdot 3^3\\cdot 5^3$\n- $\\text{lcm}(b,c)=2^1\\cdot 3^3\\cdot 5^2$\n- $\\text{lcm}(b,d)=2^2\\cdot 3^3\\cdot 5^2$\n- $\\text{lcm}(c,d)=2^2\\cdot 3^3\\cdot 5^2$\n\nStep 15: \nFrom the given LCMs, we can see that the common prime factors among all numbers are 2, 3, and 5. The smallest power of 2 among all numbers is 2^1, the smallest power of 3 is 3^2, and the smallest power of 5 is 5^2.\n\nStep 16: \nTherefore, the GCD of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ is equal to 2^1 * 3^2 * 5^2 = 2 * 9 * 25 = 450.\n\nStep 17: \nTherefore, the GCD of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ is 450.\n\nStep 18: \nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{450}",
  "Step 1: Problem Explanation\nWe are given two right triangles inscribed in circles A and B. The first triangle is a 3-4-5 right triangle inscribed in circle A, and the second triangle is a 5-12-13 right triangle inscribed in circle B. We need to find the ratio of the area of circle A to the area of circle B. The final answer should be in the form m/n, where m and n are relatively prime positive integers. Then, we need to find m + n.\n\nStep 2: \nTo find the ratio of the areas of the two circles, we need to find the radii of the circles. Since the triangles are inscribed in the circles, the hypotenuse of each triangle is the diameter of the respective circle. Therefore, we can find the radii by dividing the hypotenuse by 2.\n\nStep 3: \nFor the 3-4-5 right triangle inscribed in circle A, the hypotenuse is 5. So, the radius of circle A is 5/2.\n\nStep 4: \nSimilarly, for the 5-12-13 right triangle inscribed in circle B, the hypotenuse is 13. So, the radius of circle B is 13/2.\n\nStep 5: \nThe area of a circle is given by the formula A = \u03c0r^2, where r is the radius. Therefore, the area of circle A is \u03c0(5/2)^2 = 25\u03c0/4, and the area of circle B is \u03c0(13/2)^2 = 169\u03c0/4.\n\nStep 6: \nTo find the ratio of the areas, we divide the area of circle A by the area of circle B: (25\u03c0/4) / (169\u03c0/4) = 25/169.\n\nStep 7: \nSince 25 and 169 are relatively prime, the ratio is already in the form m/n, where m = 25 and n = 169. Therefore, m + n = 25 + 169 = 194.\n\nStep 8: \nTherefore, the final answer is 194.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{194}",
  "Step 1: First, let's understand the problem. Jackson has a paintbrush that creates a narrow strip with a width of 6.5 millimeters. He has enough paint to make a strip 25 meters long. We need to find out how many square centimeters of paper he could cover with paint.\n\nStep 2: To solve this problem, we need to convert the length from meters to centimeters and the width from millimeters to centimeters. Then, we can calculate the area of the strip in square centimeters.\n\nStep 3: First, let's convert the length from meters to centimeters. Since 1 meter = 100 centimeters, 25 meters = 25 * 100 = 2500 centimeters.\n\nStep 4: Next, let's convert the width from millimeters to centimeters. Since 1 centimeter = 10 millimeters, 6.5 millimeters = 6.5 / 10 = 0.65 centimeters.\n\nStep 5: Now that we have the length and width in centimeters, we can calculate the area of the strip. The area of a rectangle (such as the strip) is given by length * width. So, area = 2500 * 0.65.\n\nStep 6: Multiply 2500 by 0.65 to get the area in square centimeters.\n\nStep 7: 2500 * 0.65 = 1625.\n\nStep 8: Therefore, Jackson could cover 1625 square centimeters of paper with paint.\n\nStep 9: So, the final answer is 1625.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{1625}",
  "Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem is about a game where a $2 \\times 1$ rectangle is placed on a $3 \\times 3$ grid of squares, but the exact position of the rectangle is unknown. The goal is to find at least one square that is covered by the rectangle using the minimum number of turns. In each turn, a square is guessed, and the response is whether that square is covered by the rectangle.\n\nStep 2: Determine the total number of squares in the grid\nThe grid is $3 \\times 3$, so there are $3 \\times 3 = 9$ squares in total.\n\nStep 3: Consider the possible positions of the rectangle\nThe rectangle is $2 \\times 1$, so it can be placed in two possible orientations: horizontally or vertically. If placed horizontally, it covers two adjacent squares in a row. If placed vertically, it covers two adjacent squares in a column. Since the rectangle is $2 \\times 1$, it can be placed in any of the following positions:\n\n- Horizontal: There are 3 possible horizontal positions (top, middle, bottom), each covering two adjacent squares.\n- Vertical: There are 3 possible vertical positions (left, middle, right), each covering two adjacent squares.\n\nTherefore, there are 3 horizontal and 3 vertical positions, making a total of 6 possible positions for the rectangle.\n\nStep 4: Consider the worst-case scenario\nTo find the minimum number of turns, we need to consider the worst-case scenario where the rectangle is placed in a position that makes it difficult to guess a covered square. Let's analyze the possible positions:\n\n- If the rectangle is placed horizontally at the top, middle, or bottom, it covers two squares in a row. In this case, guessing any square in that row would reveal that it is covered. However, if the rectangle is placed vertically, it covers two squares in a column. In this case, guessing any square in that column would reveal that it is covered.\n\nStep 5: Determine the minimum number of turns\nTo guarantee that at least one square is covered, we need to consider the worst-case scenario where the rectangle is placed in a position that makes it difficult to guess a covered square. Let's analyze the possible positions:\n\n- If the rectangle is placed horizontally, there are 3 possible horizontal positions. In each position, there are two squares covered. If we guess a square in the same row as the rectangle, we would know that it is covered. However, if we guess a square in a different row, we would not know if it is covered or not. Therefore, to guarantee that at least one square is covered, we need to guess at least one square in each row. Since there are 3 rows, we need to guess at least 3 squares.\n\n- If the rectangle is placed vertically, there are 3 possible vertical positions. In each position, there are two squares covered. If we guess a square in the same column as the rectangle, we would know that it is covered. However, if we guess a square in a different column, we would not know if it is covered or not. Therefore, to guarantee that at least one square is covered, we need to guess at least one square in each column. Since there are 3 columns, we need to guess at least 3 squares.\n\nTherefore, in the worst-case scenario, we need to guess at least 3 squares to guarantee that at least one square is covered.\n\nStep 6: Consider the total number of squares\nSince there are 9 squares in total, and we need to guess at least 3 squares, the minimum number of turns is 3.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of turns needed to ensure that at least one of your guessed squares is covered by the rectangle is 3.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{3}",
  "Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem asks us to determine how many of the 11 disjoint open intervals remaining after removing the roots of the given polynomial P(x) have P(x) positive.\n\nStep 2: Recall the properties of polynomial roots and intervals\nWhen the roots of a polynomial are removed from the number line, the remaining intervals are open and disjoint. The polynomial P(x) is positive on intervals where it does not change sign. Since P(x) is a product of linear factors, its sign is determined by the signs of the factors.\n\nStep 3: Determine the sign of P(x) on each interval\nTo determine the sign of P(x) on each interval, we need to consider the signs of the factors (x - k)^k, where k is a root of P(x). The sign of each factor is determined by the sign of x - k. For example, (x - 1)^1 is positive when x > 1 and negative when x < 1.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the intervals\nSince the roots are 1, 2, 3, ..., 10, the intervals are (\u2212\u221e, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), ..., (9, 10), (10, \u221e).

  "Step 1: The problem asks us to find the number of integers n for which the given expression represents a real number. The expression involves logarithms and square roots, so we need to carefully analyze each part to determine the conditions under which the expression is real.\n\nStep 2: First, let's start by simplifying the expression inside the square root. The expression is \\[\\sqrt{\\frac{\\log (n^2) - (\\log n)^2}{\\log n - 3}}.\\]We can simplify the numerator and denominator separately.\n\nStep 3: The numerator is \\[\\log (n^2) - (\\log n)^2.\\]Using the property of logarithms that \\[\\log a^b = b \\log a,\\]we can rewrite \\[\\log (n^2) = 2 \\log n.\\]So, the numerator becomes \\[2 \\log n - (\\log n)^2.\\]\n\nStep 4: The denominator is \\[\\log n - 3.\\]\n\nStep 5: Therefore, the expression inside the square root is \\[\\frac{2 \\log n - (\\log n)^2}{\\log n - 3}.\\]\n\nStep 6: To determine when this expression is real, we need to consider the numerator and denominator separately.\n\nStep 7: The numerator is a quadratic expression in terms of \\log n. Let's denote \\log n as x. Then, the numerator becomes \\[2x - x^2.\\]This is a quadratic expression, which can be factored as \\[x(2 - x).\\]So, the numerator is x(2 - x).\n\nStep 8: The denominator is \\log n - 3. Let's denote this as y. Then, the denominator is y.\n\nStep 9: Therefore, the expression inside the square root is \\[\\frac{x(2 - x)}{y}.\\]\n\nStep 10: For this expression to be real, the numerator and denominator must both be real, and the denominator must be non-zero.\n\nStep 11: The numerator is x(2 - x), which is a quadratic expression in x. Since x is \\log n, which is a real number, the numerator is real.\n\nStep 12: The denominator is y = \\log n - 3. For the denominator to be real, \\log n - 3 must be real. Since \\log n is real, subtracting 3 from it will also be real. Therefore, the denominator is real.\n\nStep 13: However, the denominator must be non-zero. Therefore, \\log n - 3 \u2260 0. Solving this inequality, we get \\log n \u2260 3. Therefore, n \u2260 10^3 = 1000.\n\nStep 14: Therefore, the denominator is non-zero for all n except n = 1000.\n\nStep 15: Therefore, the expression inside the square root is real for all n except n = 1000.\n\nStep 16: However, we need to check if the expression inside the square root is non-negative. Since the square root is real, the expression inside the square root must be non-negative.\n\nStep 17: Let's denote the expression inside the square root as z. Then, z = \\frac{x(2 - x)}{y}. Since x and y are real, z is real. Therefore, z \u2265 0.\n\nStep 18: Therefore, we need to find the values of n for which \\frac{x(2 - x)}{y} \u2265 0.\n\nStep 19: Let's denote x = \\log n and y = \\log n - 3. Then, the expression becomes \\frac{\\log n(2 - \\log n)}{\\log n - 3} \u2265 0.\n\nStep 20: Let's analyze the numerator and denominator separately.\n\nStep 21: The numerator is \\log n(2 - \\log n). Let's denote this as f(x) = x(2 - x). Then, f(x) is a quadratic expression in x. The graph of f(x) is a parabola that opens downwards. Therefore, f(x) \u2265 0 when x \u2264 0 or x \u2265 2.\n\nStep 22: Similarly, the denominator is \\log n - 3. Let's denote this as g(x) = x - 3. Then, g(x) is a linear expression in x. The graph of g(x) is a line with slope 1 and y-intercept -3. Therefore, g(x) \u2265 0 when x \u2265 3.\n\nStep 23: Therefore, the expression \\frac{\\log n(2 - \\log n)}{\\log n - 3} \u2265 0 when \\log n \u2264 0 or \\log n \u2265 2, and \\log n \u2265 3.\n\nStep 24: Let's analyze the intervals where \\log n \u2264 0, \\log n \u2265 2, and \\log n \u2265 3.\n\nStep 25: Since \\log n is a real number, \\log n \u2264 0 when n \u2264 1. Therefore, the interval is n \u2264 1.\n\nStep 26: Similarly, \\log n \u2265 2 when n \u2265 10^2 = 100. Therefore, the interval is n \u2265 100.\n\nStep 27: Similarly, \\log n \u2265 3 when n \u2265 10^3 = 1000. Therefore, the interval is n \u2265 1000.\n\nStep 28: Therefore, the expression is non-negative when n \u2264 1 or n \u2265 100, or n \u2265 1000.\n\nStep 29: However, we need to exclude n = 1000 because the denominator is zero at n = 1000.\n\nStep 30: Therefore, the expression is non-negative for all n except n = 1000.\n\nStep 31: Therefore, the number of integers n for which the expression is real is the number of integers n \u2264 1 or n \u2265 100, or n \u2265 1000, excluding n = 1000.\n\nStep 32: Let's count the number of integers in each interval.\n\nStep 33: For n \u2264 1, the integers are 0, 1. Therefore, there are 2 integers.\n\nStep 34: For n \u2265 100, the integers are 100, 101, ..., 999. Therefore, there are 900 integers.\n\nStep 35: For n \u2265 1000, the integers are 1000, 1001, ..., \u221e. However, we need to exclude n = 1000. Therefore, the number of integers is 1001, 1002, ..., \u221e. Therefore, there are \u221e - 1000 = \u221e integers.\n\nStep 36: Therefore, the total number of integers is 2 + 900 + \u221e = \u221e.\n\nStep 37: However, the problem asks for the number of integers n for which the expression is real. Since the expression is real for all n except n = 1000, the number of integers is the total number of integers minus 1 (for n = 1000).\n\nStep 38: Therefore, the number of integers is \u221e - 1 = \u221e.\n\nStep 39: However, the problem asks for a numerical answer.

  "Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe need to find the number of nonempty subsets B of the set {0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 12} such that the number of elements in B is equal to the least element of B.\n\nStep 2: Identify the possible least elements\nSince the least element of B must be equal to the number of elements in B, the least element can be 1, 2, 3, ..., 12. However, for each least element k, the number of elements in B must be k. Therefore, we need to find the number of subsets with k elements for each k from 1 to 12.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the number of subsets for each k\nFor each k from 1 to 12, the number of subsets with k elements is given by the combination formula C(12, k), where C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n\nStep 4: Sum the number of subsets for each k\nTo find the total number of subsets B that satisfy the condition, we need to sum the number of subsets for each k from 1 to 12.\n\nStep 5: Compute the sum\nLet's compute the sum:\n\nC(12, 1) + C(12, 2) + C(12, 3) + ... + C(12, 12)\n\nUsing the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!) where n! denotes the factorial of n.\n\nStep 6: Calculate each term\nLet's calculate each term:\n\nC(12, 1) = 12! / (1! * (12-1)!) = 12\n\nC(12, 2) = 12! / (2! * (12-2)!) = 12*11/2 = 66\n\nC(12, 3) = 12! / (3! * (12-3)!) = 12*11*10/6 = 220\n\nC(12, 4) = 12! / (4! * (12-4)!) = 12*11*10*9/24 = 495\n\nC(12, 5) = 12! / (5! * (12-5)!) = 12*11*10*9*8/120 = 792\n\nC(12, 6) = 12! / (6! * (12-6)!) = 12*11*10*9*8*7/720 = 924\n\nC(12, 7) = 12! / (7! * (12-7)!) = 12*11*10*9*8*7*6/5040 = 792\n\nC(12, 8) = 12! / (8! * (12-8)!) = 12*11*10*9*8*7*6/40320 = 495\n\nC(12, 9) = 12! / (9! * (12-9)!) = 12*11*10*9*8*7*6/362880 = 220\n\nC(12, 10) = 12! / (10! * (12-10)!) = 12*11*10*9*8*7*6/3628800 = 66\n\nC(12, 11) = 12! / (11! * (12-11)!) = 12*11*10*9*8*7*6/39916800 = 12\n\nC(12, 12) = 12! / (12! * (12-12)!) = 1\n\nStep 7: Sum the terms\nNow, let's sum the terms:\n\n12 + 66 + 220 + 495 + 792 + 924 + 792 + 495 + 220 + 66 + 12 + 1\n\nStep 8: Perform the addition\n\n12 + 66 = 78\n\n78 + 220 = 298\n\n298 + 495 = 793\n\n793 + 792 = 1585\n\n1585 + 924 = 2509\n\n2509 + 792 = 3301\n\n3301 + 495 = 3796\n\n3796 + 220 = 4016\n\n4016 + 66 = 4082\n\n4082 + 12 = 4094\n\n4094 + 1 = 4095\n\nTherefore, the total number of subsets B that satisfy the condition is 4095.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{4095}",
  "Step 1: The problem asks for the area of the region in the coordinate plane defined by the inequality $| | x | - 1 | + | | y | - 1 | \\le 1$. To solve this, we need to understand the geometric shape described by this inequality.\n\nStep 2: The inequality involves absolute values, which typically correspond to the distance of a point from a certain point or line. In this case, the absolute values are $|x - 1|$ and $|y - 1|$. So, the inequality can be interpreted as the sum of the distances from the point (x, y) to the points (1, 0) and (0, 1) being less than or equal to 1.\n\nStep 3: Let's break down the inequality into four cases based on the signs of (x - 1) and (y - 1). This will help us visualize the region.\n\nCase 1: When x \u2265 1 and y \u2265 1, the inequality becomes |x - 1| + |y - 1| \u2264 1. Since both x and y are greater than 1, the absolute values become x - 1 and y - 1. So, the inequality is (x - 1) + (y - 1) \u2264 1, which simplifies to x + y \u2264 3. This is a line in the first quadrant with x + y = 3.\n\nCase 2: When x \u2265 1 and y \u2264 1, the inequality becomes |x - 1| + |1 - y| \u2264 1. Since x is greater than 1 and y is less than 1, the absolute values become x - 1 and 1 - y. So, the inequality is (x - 1) + (1 - y) \u2264 1, which simplifies to x - y \u2264 1. This is a line in the first quadrant with x - y = 1.\n\nCase 3: When x \u2264 1 and y \u2265 1, the inequality becomes |1 - x| + |y - 1| \u2264 1. Since x is less than 1 and y is greater than 1, the absolute values become 1 - x and y - 1. So, the inequality is (1 - x) + (y - 1) \u2264 1, which simplifies to y - x \u2264 1. This is a line in the first quadrant with y - x = 1.\n\nCase 4: When x \u2264 1 and y \u2264 1, the inequality becomes |1 - x| + |1 - y| \u2264 1. Since x is less than 1 and y is less than 1, the absolute values become 1 - x and 1 - y. So, the inequality is (1 - x) + (1 - y) \u2264 1, which simplifies to 2 - x - y \u2264 1, or x + y \u2265 1. This is a line in the third quadrant with x + y = 1.\n\nStep 4: Now, let's plot these lines on the coordinate plane. The lines are x + y = 3, x - y = 1, y - x = 1, and x + y = 1. The region defined by the inequality is the area where all these lines are satisfied.\n\nStep 5: The lines x + y = 3, x - y = 1, and y - x = 1 form a triangle in the first quadrant. The line x + y = 1 is a line in the third quadrant. The region is the area where all these lines are satisfied.\n\nStep 6: The intersection of the lines x + y = 3 and x - y = 1 is (2, 1). The intersection of the lines x + y = 3 and y - x = 1 is (1, 2). The intersection of the lines x - y = 1 and y - x = 1 is (0, 0). The intersection of the lines x + y = 1 and x - y = 1 is (1, 0). The intersection of the lines x + y = 1 and y - x = 1 is (0, 1).\n\nStep 7: The region is a square with vertices at (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), and (0, 1). The area of this square is 1 * 1 = 1.\n\nStep 8: Therefore, the area of the region defined by the inequality is 1.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{1}"
