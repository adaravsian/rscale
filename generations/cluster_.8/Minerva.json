  "Step 1:  First, let's understand the problem. We have two Magellan telescopes with a diameter of 6.5 m each. In one configuration, the effective focal length is 72 m. We need to find the diameter of the image of a planet at this focus if the angular diameter of the planet is 45 arcseconds.\nStep 2:  To solve this, we can use the formula for the diameter of the image formed by a telescope, which is given by the formula: \\(d = \\theta \\times f\\), where \\(d\\) is the diameter of the image, \\(\\theta\\) is the angular diameter of the object, and \\(f\\) is the focal length of the telescope.\nStep 3:  However, in this case, we are given the effective focal length, which is the product of the focal length of the telescope and the magnification. Since the telescopes are identical, the magnification is the ratio of the focal length of the telescope to the diameter of the telescope. Therefore, the effective focal length is \\(72 \\mathrm{~m} = 6.5 \\mathrm{~m} \\times M\\), where \\(M\\) is the magnification.\nStep 4:  So, the magnification \\(M\\) is \\(72 / 6.5 = 11\\). Therefore, the effective focal length is 72 m, which is 11 times the diameter of the telescope.\nStep 5:  Now, we need to find the diameter of the image of the planet. The angular diameter of the planet is 45 arcseconds. We need to convert this to radians to use in the formula. Since 1 arcsecond is \\(1 / (60 \\times 60) = 1 / 3600\\) radians, 45 arcseconds is \\(45 / 3600 = 0.0125\\) radians.\nStep 6:  Therefore, the diameter of the image is \\(d = \\theta \\times f = 0.0125 \\times 72 = 0.9 \\mathrm{~m}\\).\nStep 7:  However, the problem asks for the diameter in centimeters. So, we need to convert 0.9 m to centimeters. Since 1 m = 100 cm, 0.9 m = 0.9 * 100 = 90 cm.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the diameter of the image of the planet at the focus is 90 cm.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{90}",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to calculate the luminosity of the white dwarf star, which is treated as a blackbody radiator. The luminosity of a blackbody is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the luminosity (L) is proportional to the fourth power of the effective temperature (T_e) and the surface area (A) of the blackbody. Mathematically, this can be expressed as L = \u03c3 \\* A \\* T_e^4, where \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\nStep 2:  First, we need to convert the given effective temperature from Kelvin to a more suitable unit. The Stefan-Boltzmann constant \u03c3 is typically given in units of erg cm^-2 s^-1 K^-4. Therefore, to use the formula L = \u03c3 \\* A \\* T_e^4, we need to ensure that the temperature is in Kelvin and the area is in square centimeters.\n\nStep 3:  The radius of the white dwarf is given as 10^4 km, which is equivalent to 10^7 m or 10^9 cm. We can use this radius to calculate the surface area of the white dwarf. The surface area of a sphere (such as a star) is given by the formula A = 4 \\* \u03c0 \\* R^2, where R is the radius.\n\nStep 4:  Therefore, we can calculate the surface area of the white dwarf as A = 4 \\* \u03c0 \\* (10^9 cm)^2 = 4 \\* \u03c0 \\* 10^18 cm^2.\n\nStep 5:  Next, we need to convert the effective temperature from Kelvin to a unit that matches the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The Stefan-Boltzmann constant \u03c3 is typically given in units of erg cm^-2 s^-1 K^-4. Therefore, we need to convert the temperature from Kelvin to degrees Kelvin.\n\nStep 6:  The effective temperature is given as 50,000 degrees Kelvin. Since the Stefan-Boltzmann constant is in units of erg cm^-2 s^-1 K^-4, we can directly use this temperature in the formula L = \u03c3 \\* A \\* T_e^4.\n\nStep 7:  Now, we can plug in the values into the formula L = \u03c3 \\* A \\* T_e^4. The Stefan-Boltzmann constant \u03c3 is approximately 5.67 x 10^-5 erg cm^-2 s^-1 K^-4. The surface area A is 4 \\* \u03c0 \\* 10^18 cm^2, and the temperature T_e is 50,000 K.\n\nStep 8:  Substituting these values into the formula, we get L = (5.67 x 10^-5 erg cm^-2 s^-1 K^-4) \\* (4 \\* \u03c0 \\* 10^18 cm^2) \\* (50,000 K)^4.\n\nStep 9:  Performing the calculations, we get L = (5.67 x 10^-5) \\* (4 \\* \u03c0 \\* 10^18) \\* (50,000)^4 = (5.67 x 10^-5) \\* (4 \\* 3.14159 \\* 10^18) \\* (250,000,000,000)^4.\n\nStep 10:  Calculating the exponent first, (250,000,000,000)^4 = (2.5 x 10^11)^4 = (2.5)^4 \\* (10^11)^4 = 15.625 \\* 10^44.\n\nStep 11:  Multiplying the remaining terms, (5.67 x 10^-5) \\* (4 \\* 3.14159 \\* 10^18) \\* 15.625 \\* 10^44 = (5.67 x 10^-5) \\* (4 \\* 3.14159) \\* 15.625 \\* 10^18 \\* 10^44.\n\nStep 12:  Simplifying the constants, (5.67 x 10^-5) \\* (4 \\*

  "Step 1:  The problem describes a prism with sides forming a right triangle, where the other two angles are equal to $45^{\\circ}$. The sides are denoted as $L, L$, and $H$, where $L$ is a leg and $H$ is the hypotenuse. A parallel light beam enters side $L$ normal to the surface, passes into the glass, and then strikes $H$ internally. We are asked to compute the critical angle for the light to be internally reflected at $H$.\nStep 2:  To find the critical angle, we need to consider the angle of incidence at which the light beam is just about to be totally internally reflected. This occurs when the angle of incidence equals the critical angle, denoted as $\\theta_c$. The critical angle is the angle of incidence above which total internal reflection occurs.\nStep 3:  The critical angle can be found using Snell's law, which relates the angles of incidence and refraction to the indices of refraction of the two media involved. In this case, the light is passing from the glass into air, so we need to find the angle of incidence in the glass such that the angle of refraction in air is $90^{\\circ}$.\nStep 4:  The index of refraction of the glass is given as $n=1.5$. The index of refraction of air is approximately $1.0$. Therefore, the critical angle can be calculated using the formula $\\sin \\theta_c = \\frac{n_2}{n_1}$, where $n_1$ is the index of refraction of the glass and $n_2$ is the index of refraction of air.\nStep 5:  Substituting the given values, we get $\\sin \\theta_c = \\frac{1.0}{1.5}$. Therefore, $\\theta_c = \\sin^{-1} \\left( \\frac{1.0}{1.5} \\right)$.\nStep 6:  To find the critical angle in degrees to 3 significant figures, we need to compute the inverse sine of $\\frac{1.0}{1.5}$ and then convert the result to degrees.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the critical angle is $\\theta_c = \\sin^{-1} \\left( \\frac{1.0}{1.5} \\right) \\approx \\sin^{-1} (0.6667) \\approx 41.81^{\\circ}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{41.8}$",
  "Step 1: Understand the problem and the given information. We are given a star with an absolute magnitude M = -7. The star is observed in a galaxy that is at a distance of 3 Mpc. We need to find the apparent magnitude of the star.\n\nStep 2: Recall the formula that relates absolute magnitude (M) and apparent magnitude (m) to the distance (d) in parsecs (pc). The formula is m = M + 5log10(d/10). However, the distance is given in megaparsecs (Mpc), so we need to convert it to parsecs first.\n\nStep 3: Convert the distance from megaparsecs (Mpc) to parsecs (pc). 1 Mpc = 1,000,000 pc. Therefore, 3 Mpc = 3,000,000 pc.\n\nStep 4: Plug the values into the formula: m = M + 5log10(d/10). Here, M = -7, d = 3,000,000 pc. So, m = -7 + 5log10(3,000,000/10).\n\nStep 5: Calculate the logarithm: log10(3,000,000/10) = log10(300,000) = 5.477.

  "Step 1:  The problem requires finding the theoretical limiting angular resolution of an 8-inch (diameter) optical telescope in the visible spectrum. The limiting angular resolution is the minimum angle between two objects that can be resolved by the telescope. This is determined by the telescope's diameter and the wavelength of the light being observed.\nStep 2:  The formula to calculate the limiting angular resolution is given by the Rayleigh criterion, which states that the minimum angle \u03b8 between two point sources that can be resolved is given by \u03b8 = 1.22 * \u03bb / D, where \u03bb is the wavelength of the light and D is the diameter of the telescope.\nStep 3:  First, we need to convert the given wavelength from angstroms (\u00c5) to meters. The wavelength is given as 5000 \u00c5, which is equivalent to 5000 * 10^-10 m = 5 * 10^-7 m.\nStep 4:  The diameter of the telescope is given as 8 inches, which needs to be converted to meters. Since 1 inch is approximately 0.0254 meters, the diameter in meters is 8 * 0.0254 = 0.2032 meters.\nStep 5:  Now, we can substitute these values into the formula \u03b8 = 1.22 * \u03bb / D to find the limiting angular resolution.\nStep 6:  Plugging in the values, we get \u03b8 = 1.22 * (5 * 10^-7 m) / (0.2032 m).\nStep 7:  Calculating this, we get \u03b8 = 1.22 * 5 * 10^-7 / 0.2032 = 3.00 * 10^-7 radians.\nStep 8:  To convert radians to arcseconds, we use the conversion factor: 1 radian = 206265 arcseconds.\nStep 9:  Therefore, 3.00 * 10^-7 radians is equal to 3.00 * 10^-7 * 206265 arcseconds = 6.20 * 10^-4 arcseconds.\nStep 10:  Rounding to two significant figures, the limiting angular resolution is approximately 6.2 arcseconds.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{6.2}",

We need to find the distance to this star in parsecs.\n\nStep 2: Recall the definition of parallax and its relation to distance. The parallax of a star is the angle between the position of the star when viewed from opposite sides of the Earth's orbit around the Sun. The parallax is measured in arcseconds, and it is related to the distance of the star from the Earth by the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{parallax} = \\frac{1}{\\text{distance in parsecs}} \\]\n\nTherefore, if we know the parallax, we can calculate the distance in parsecs by taking the reciprocal of the parallax.\n\nStep 3: Convert the parallax from arcseconds to parsecs. The parallax is given as $0.01^{\\prime \\prime}$, which is $0.01$ arcseconds. To convert this to parsecs, we use the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance in parsecs} = \\frac{1}{\\text{parallax in arcseconds}} \\]\n\nSubstituting the given parallax:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance in parsecs} = \\frac{1}{0.01} \\]\n\nStep 4: Perform the calculation.\n\n\\[ \\text{distance in parsecs} = \\frac{1}{0.01} = 100 \\]\n\nTherefore, the distance to the star is 100 parsecs.\n\nStep 5: Write the final answer in the required format.\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{100}",
  "To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of magnitude and how it relates to the brightness of celestial objects. The magnitude of an object is a logarithmic measure of its brightness, with lower magnitudes indicating brighter objects. The decrease in magnitude during a transit is related to the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.\n\nLet's denote the surface area of the parent star as \\(A_{star}\\) and the surface area of the planet as \\(A_{planet}\\). The problem states that the planet's surface area is \\(2\\%\\) of the star's surface area, so we can write:\n\n\\[A_{planet} = 0.02 \\times A_{star}\\]\n\nThe magnitude of an object is related to its flux (energy received per unit area per unit time) by the formula:\n\n\\[m = -2.5 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{F}{F_0} \\right)\\]\n\nwhere \\(m\\) is the magnitude, \\(F\\) is the flux of the object, and \\(F_0\\) is a reference flux (usually the flux of a standard star). The flux of the star and the planet are related to their surface areas and luminosities. Since the planet is dark, its luminosity is negligible compared to the star's, so we can assume that the flux of the system during transit is the flux of the star minus the flux of the planet. However, since the planet's surface area is very small compared to the star's, the flux of the planet is also very small, and we can approximate the flux of the system during transit as the flux of the star minus the flux of the planet. However, the problem states that the planet is dark, so its flux is essentially zero. Therefore, the flux of the system during transit is the same as the flux of the star.\n\nHowever, the problem asks for the decrease in magnitude, which is the difference between the magnitude of the system during transit and the magnitude of the system when the planet is not transiting. Since the flux of the system during transit is the same as the flux of the star, the magnitude of the system during transit is the same as the magnitude of the star. Therefore, the decrease in magnitude is the difference between the magnitude of the star and the magnitude of the system when the planet is not transiting.\n\nWhen the planet is not transiting, the flux of the system is the sum of the fluxes of the star and the planet. However, since the planet is dark, its flux is negligible, so the flux of the system when the planet is not transiting is approximately the same as the flux of the star. Therefore, the magnitude of the system when the planet is not transiting is the same as the magnitude of the star.\n\nSo, the decrease in magnitude is zero. However, this seems counterintuitive, as one might expect the transit to cause a decrease in magnitude. However, the problem states that the planet is dark, so its flux is negligible, and the flux of the system during transit is the same as the flux of the star. Therefore, the magnitude of the system during transit is the same as the magnitude of the star, and the decrease in magnitude is zero.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{0}",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to determine the component of the star's velocity parallel to its vector to the Earth. The given information includes the rest wavelength of the oxygen spectral line, the observed wavelength, the proper motion of the star, its distance from Earth, and the speed of light.\n\nStep 2:  First, we need to understand the relationship between the Doppler shift of the spectral line and the velocity of the star. The Doppler shift is given by the formula: \u0394\u03bb = (v/c) * \u03bb\u2080, where \u0394\u03bb is the shift in wavelength, v is the velocity of the star, c is the speed of light, and \u03bb\u2080 is the rest wavelength of the spectral line.\n\nStep 3:  We are given that the rest wavelength of the oxygen line is 5007 \u00c5 and the observed wavelength is 5012 \u00c5. So, the Doppler shift is \u0394\u03bb = 5012 \u00c5 - 5007 \u00c5 = 5 \u00c5. We can use this to find the velocity of the star.\n\nStep 4:  The velocity can be calculated using the formula: v = (\u0394\u03bb / \u03bb\u2080) * c. Plugging in the values, we get v = (5 \u00c5 / 5007 \u00c5) * (3 \u00d7 10^8 m/s) = 2.94 m/s. However, this is the velocity along the line of sight. Since the star is moving in three dimensions, we need to consider the component of the velocity parallel to the vector to the Earth.\n\nStep 5:  The proper motion of the star is given as 1 arc second per year, which is equivalent to 1.5 \u00d7 10^(-13) radians per second. The distance to the star is 60 pc, which is 60 \u00d7 3.26 \u00d7 10^16 m = 1.956 \u00d7 10^18 m. We can use the proper motion to find the transverse velocity of the star.\n\nStep 6:  The transverse velocity can be calculated using the formula: v_t = \u03bc * d, where \u03bc is the proper motion and d is the distance.

We need to treat the Sun as a blackbody radiator and compute its luminosity to one significant figure.\n\nStep 2:  To solve this problem, we can use the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which relates the luminosity of a blackbody to its temperature and radius. The law states that the luminosity (power output) of a blackbody is given by \\(L = 4 \\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4\\), where \\(L\\) is the luminosity, \\(R\\) is the radius of the blackbody, \\(\\sigma\\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and \\(T\\) is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nStep 3:  First, we need to convert the given temperature from Kelvin to Celsius.

However, the problem asks for the luminosity in erg/s. To convert watts to erg/s, we need to use the conversion factor: 1 watt = \\(10^{7}\\) erg/s.\n\nStep 8:  Therefore, once we have the luminosity in watts, we can multiply it by \\(10^{7}\\) to get the luminosity in erg/s.\n\nStep 9:  After performing the calculations, we should round the result to one significant figure as required.\n\nStep 10:  Let's proceed with the calculations.\n\nStep 11:  First, let's compute the radius squared: \\((7 \\times 10^{8})^2 = 49 \\times 10^{16}\\) m\u00b2.\n\nStep 12:  Then, we multiply this by the Stefan-Boltzmann constant: \\(49 \\times 10^{16} \\times 5.67 \\times 10^{-8} = 2.79 \\times 10^{9}\\) W/m\u00b2K\u2074.\n\nStep 13:  Next, we multiply this by the temperature to the fourth power: \\(2.79 \\times 10^{9} \\times 5800^4\\).\n\nStep 14:  Calculating \\(5800^4\\) gives us approximately \\(1.43 \\times 10^{14}\\).\n\nStep 15:  Multiplying this by \\(2.79 \\times 10^{9}\\) gives us \\(3.98 \\times 10^{23}\\) W.\n\nStep 16:  Finally, converting this to erg/s by multiplying by \\(10^{7}\\) gives us \\(3.98 \\times 10^{30}\\) erg/s.\n\nStep 17:  Rounding this to one significant figure, we get approximately \\(4 \\times 10^{30}\\) erg/s.\n\nStep 18:  Therefore, the luminosity of the Sun in erg/s is approximately \\(4 \\times 10^{30}\\) erg/s.\n\nStep 19:  So, the final answer is \\boxed{4 \\times 10^{30}}",

  "Step 1:  The problem involves finding the wavelength of the H\u03b1 line observed at Earth when a galaxy is moving directly away from us with a speed of 3000 km/s. We are given the rest wavelength of H\u03b1 as 6565 \u00c5 and the speed of light as 3 \u00d7 10^8 m/s. We need to convert the galaxy's speed from km/s to m/s and then apply the Doppler shift formula to find the observed wavelength.\n\nStep 2:  First, let's convert the galaxy's speed from km/s to m/s. Since 1 km = 1000 m, multiplying 3000 km/s by 1000 gives us 3,000,000 m/s.\n\nStep 3:  The Doppler shift formula for light emitted by a source moving away from the observer is given by \u03bb = \u03bb0 / (1 + v/c), where \u03bb is the observed wavelength, \u03bb0 is the rest wavelength, v is the velocity of the source, and c is the speed of light.\n\nStep 4:  In this case, the galaxy is moving away from us, so the velocity v is positive. The rest wavelength \u03bb0 is 6565 \u00c5, which needs to be converted to meters. Since 1 \u00c5 = 10^-10 m, multiplying 6565 \u00c5 by 10^-10 m/\u00c5 gives us 6.565 \u00d7 10^-7 m.\n\nStep 5:  The speed of light c is 3 \u00d7 10^8 m/s. Plugging these values into the Doppler shift formula, we get \u03bb = (6.565 \u00d7 10^-7 m) / (1 + (3,000,000 m/s) / (3 \u00d7 10^8 m/s)).\n\nStep 6:  Simplifying the denominator, (1 + 3,000,000 / (3 \u00d7 10^8)) = (1 + 0.01) = 1.01.\n\nStep 7:  Therefore, \u03bb = (6.565 \u00d7 10^-7 m) / 1.01 = 6.465 \u00d7 10^-7 m.\n\nStep 8:  To convert this to \u00c5, we divide by 10^-10 m/\u00c5, which gives us 6.465 \u00d7 10^-7 m / (10^-10 m/\u00c5) = 6.465 \u00d7 10^3 \u00c5 = 6,465 \u00c5.\n\nStep 9:  Therefore, the observed wavelength of the H\u03b1 line is 6,465 \u00c5.\n\nStep 10:  So, the final answer is \\boxed{6465}",

  "Step 1:  The problem requires us to calculate the mass of a suspected black hole at the center of our Galaxy. We are given the orbital period of a star around the black hole as 15 years and the orbital radius as 0.12 seconds of arc. The distance to the Galactic center is 8 kiloparsecs (kpc). We need to find the mass of the black hole in units of the Sun's mass, rounded to one significant figure.\n\nStep 2:  First, we need to convert the given orbital period from years to seconds. There are 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, 24 hours in a day, and 365.25 days in a year. So, the orbital period in seconds is 15 years * 365.25 days/year * 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minute = 15 * 365.25 * 24 * 60 * 60 = 1.0359e8 seconds.\n\nStep 3:  Next, we need to convert the orbital radius from seconds of arc to meters. There are 206265 seconds of arc in a radian. So, the orbital radius in radians is 0.12 seconds of arc / 206265 seconds of arc/radian = 5.81e-7 radians. The distance to the Galactic center is 8 kpc, which is 8 * 3.0857e16 meters = 2.46656e17 meters. Therefore, the orbital radius in meters is 5.81e-7 radians * 2.46656e17 meters = 1.435e10 meters.\n\nStep 4:  Now, we can use the formula F = m * a to find the mass of the black hole. The gravitational force F is given by F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2, where G is the gravitational constant, m1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects, and r is the distance between them. In this case, m1 is the mass of the black hole, m2 is the mass of the star, and r is the orbital radius. The acceleration a is given by a = F / m2. Therefore, m1 = F * r^2 / (G * m2).\n\nStep 5:  We can calculate the acceleration a using the given orbital period and radius. The orbital period is the time taken for one complete orbit, so the velocity of the star is v = 2 * pi * r / T, where T is the orbital period. The acceleration is a = v^2 / r = (2 * pi * r / T)^2 / r = (2 * pi / T)^2 * r = (2 * pi / 1.0359e8)^2 * 1.435e10 = 1.35e-6 m/s^2.\n\nStep 6:  The gravitational force F is given by F = m2 * a. Therefore, m1 = F * r^2 / (G * m2) = m2 * a * r^2 / (G * m2) = a * r^2 / G.\n\nStep 7:  We can calculate the mass of the black hole using the formula m1 = a * r^2 / G. Plugging in the values, m1 = 1.35e-6 m/s^2 * (1.435e10 m)^2 / (6.674e-11 N m^2 kg^-2) = 1.35e-6 * 2.06e21 / 6.674e-11 = 3.55e30 kg.\n\nStep 8:  To express the mass in units of the Sun's mass, we need to divide by the mass of the Sun, which is 1.989e30 kg. Therefore, the mass of the black hole is 3.55e30 / 1.989e30 = 1.79.\n\nStep 9:  Rounding to one significant figure, the mass of the black hole is approximately 2 times the mass of the Sun.\n\nStep 10:  Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{2}",

Since \\(1 \\mathrm{kpc} = 3.0857 \\times 10^{19} \\mathrm{cm}\\), then \\(800 \\mathrm{kpc} = 800 \\times 3.0857 \\times 10^{19} \\mathrm{cm} = 2.46656 \\times 10^{22} \\mathrm{cm}\\).\nStep 4:  The luminosity \\(L\\) can be found by rearranging the formula: \\(L = 4 \\pi r^2 F\\).\nStep 5:  Plugging in the values, we get \\(L = 4 \\pi (2.46656 \\times 10^{22} \\mathrm{cm})^2 \\times 10^{-12} \\mathrm{erg} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\).\nStep 6:  First, calculate the square of the distance: \\((2.46656 \\times 10^{22} \\mathrm{cm})^2 = 6.104 \\times 10^{44} \\mathrm{cm}^2\\).\nStep 7:  Then, multiply by \\(4 \\pi\\): \\(4 \\pi \\times 6.104 \\times 10^{44} \\mathrm{cm}^2 = 7.636 \\times 10^{45} \\mathrm{cm}^2\\).\nStep 8:  Finally, multiply by the flux: \\(7.636 \\times 10^{45} \\mathrm{cm}^2 \\times 10^{-12} \\mathrm{erg} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\mathrm{cm}^{-2} = 7.636 \\times 10^{33} \\mathrm{erg} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\).\nStep 9:  Therefore, the luminosity of the star is \\(7.636 \\times 10^{33} \\mathrm{erg} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\).\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{7.636 x 10^33}",
  "Step 1:  First, we need to understand the problem. We have a large ground-based telescope with an effective focal length of 10 meters. Two astronomical objects are separated by 1 arc second in the sky. We need to find out how far apart the two corresponding images will be in the focal plane, in microns.\n\nStep 2:  To solve this problem, we need to convert the angular separation from arc seconds to radians, then use the focal length to calculate the distance between the images in the focal plane.\n\nStep 3:  First, let's convert 1 arc second to radians. There are 3600 arc seconds in a degree, and 2\u03c0 radians in a full circle. So, 1 arc second is equal to 1 / (3600 * 2\u03c0) radians.\n\nStep 4:  Let's calculate this: 1 arc second = 1 / (3600 * 2\u03c0) radians = 1 / (3600 * 2 * 3.14159) radians \u2248 1 / 11309.04 radians \u2248 8.794 \u00d7 10^(-5) radians.\n\nStep 5:  Now, we need to use the focal length to find the distance between the images. The focal length is 10 meters, which is 10,000,000 microns.\n\nStep 6:  The distance between the images in the focal plane is equal to the focal length times the angular separation in radians. So, distance = focal length * angular separation.\n\nStep 7:  Plugging in the values, distance = 10,000,000 microns * 8.794 \u00d7 10^(-5) radians.\n\nStep 8:  Multiplying these values, distance = 10,000,000 * 8.794 \u00d7 10^(-5) = 0.8794 microns.\n\nStep 9:  Therefore, the two corresponding images will be separated by approximately 0.8794 microns in the focal plane.\n\nStep 10:  So, the final answer is \\boxed{0.8794}",

  "Step 1: Understand the problem and the given expression for the total energy of the Sun.\nThe problem states that the total energy of the Sun is given by the expression \\( E \\simeq -\\frac{G M^{2}}{R} \\), where \\( M \\) is the mass and \\( R \\) is the radius. We are asked to find the time it takes for the Sun to shrink to half its present radius, assuming the energy generation is turned off and the mass remains constant, with the surface temperature remaining constant at approximately 5800 K.\n\nStep 2: Recall the relationship between power radiated and change in total energy.\nThe power radiated at the Sun's surface is related to the change in its total energy. The power radiated is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the power radiated per unit area is proportional to the fourth power of the surface temperature. However, since the surface temperature is assumed constant, the power radiated is proportional to the surface area, which is \\( 4 \\pi R^2 \\). Therefore, the total power radiated is \\( P = 4 \\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4 \\), where \\( \\sigma \\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\nStep 3: Express the power radiated in terms of the total energy and the rate of change of the radius.\nThe power radiated is equal to the rate of change of the total energy, i.e., \\( P = -\\frac{dE}{dt} \\).

  "Step 1: Understand the problem and the given equations.\nThe problem involves a star like the Sun ascending the giant branch.

Additionally, the energy released per unit mass of core converted from hydrogen to helium is given by:\n\\[ \\Delta E = 0.007 \\Delta M c^{2} \\]\nwhere \\( c \\) is the speed of light. We need to derive a differential equation for \\( M \\) in terms of time.\n\nStep 2: Express the luminosity in terms of the core mass and the energy released.\nThe luminosity is the rate at which energy is released. Since the energy released per unit mass of core converted is \\( \\Delta E = 0.007 \\Delta M c^{2} \\), the total energy released per unit time is the luminosity. Therefore, we can equate the two expressions for luminosity:\n\\[ L = \\frac{10^{5} L_{\\odot}}{M_{\\odot}^{6}} M^{6} = \\frac{dE}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\int \\Delta E dt = \\frac{d}{dt} \\int 0.007 \\Delta M c^{2} dt \\]\n\nStep 3: Write the differential equation for the core mass.\nLet's denote the core mass at time \\( t \\) as \\( M(t) \\). The rate of change of core mass is \\( \\frac{dM}{dt} \\). Therefore, the energy released per unit time is:\n\\[ \\frac{dE}{dt} = 0.007 c^{2} \\frac{dM}{dt} \\]\nEquating this to the luminosity expression:\n\\[ 0.007 c^{2} \\frac{dM}{dt} = \\frac{10^{5} L_{\\odot}}{M_{\\odot}^{6}} M^{6} \\]\n\nStep 4: Solve for \\( \\frac{dM}{dt} \\).\nRearranging the equation to solve for \\( \\frac{dM}{dt} \\):\n\\[ \\frac{dM}{dt} = \\frac{\\frac{10^{5} L_{\\odot}}{M_{\\odot}^{6}} M^{6}}{0.007 c^{2}} \\]\n\nStep 5: Simplify the expression.\n\\[ \\frac{dM}{dt} = \\frac{10^{5} L_{\\odot}}{0.007 M_{\\odot}^{6} c^{2}} M^{6} \\]\n\nStep 6: Write the final differential equation.\n\\[ \\frac{dM}{dt} = \\frac{10^{5} L_{\\odot}}{0.007 M_{\\odot}^{6} c^{2}} M^{6} \\]\n\nStep 7: Express the constant in terms of \\( c \\), \\( M_{\\odot} \\), and \\( L_{\\odot} \\).\n\\[ \\frac{10^{5} L_{\\odot}}{0.007 M_{\\odot}^{6} c^{2}} = \\frac{10^{5} L_{\\odot}}{0.007 M_{\\odot}^{6}} \\frac{1}{c^{2}} = \\frac{10^{5} L_{\\odot}}{0.007 M_{\\odot}^{6}} \\frac{1}{c^{2}} \\]\n\nStep 8: Write the final differential equation in terms of \\( c \\), \\( M_{\\odot} \\), and \\( L_{\\odot} \\).\n\\[ \\frac{dM}{dt} = \\frac{10^{5} L_{\\odot}}{0.007 M_{\\odot}^{6}} \\frac{1}{c^{2}} M^{6} \\]\n\nStep 9: Write the final answer in the required format.\nThe final answer is \\boxed{\\frac{10^{5} L_{\\odot}}{0.007 M_{\\odot}^{6}} \\frac{1}{c^{2}} M^{6}}",

  "Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are given an eclipsing binary system consisting of two stars with different radii and effective temperatures. The smaller star has a radius of 0.5 times that of the larger star, and its effective temperature is twice that of the larger star. We need to find the change in bolometric magnitude, \u0394m_bol, when the smaller star is eclipsed by the larger star.\n\nStep 2: Recall the definition of bolometric magnitude\nThe bolometric magnitude is the magnitude of a star if all its radiation, regardless of wavelength, is considered. It is defined as:\n\nm_bol = -2.5 log10 (F_bol / F_0)\n\nwhere F_bol is the bolometric flux of the star, and F_0 is a reference flux (usually taken as 1 solar flux). The bolometric flux is the total energy radiated by the star per unit area per unit time.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the bolometric flux of each star\nThe bolometric flux of a star is given by:\n\nF_bol = (4 \\* \u03c0 \\* R^2 \\* \u03c3 \\* T^4) / (4 \\* \u03c0 \\* d^2)\n\nwhere R is the radius of the star, \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, T is the effective temperature, and d is the distance to the star. However, since we are considering the change in bolometric magnitude, we can assume that the distance to the stars is the same, so the d^2 term cancels out. Therefore, we can write:\n\nF_bol \u221d R^2 \\* T^4\n\nStep 4: Calculate the bolometric flux of the smaller star when eclipsed\nWhen the smaller star is eclipsed by the larger star, the bolometric flux of the smaller star is reduced by a factor equal to the ratio of the areas of the two stars. The area of the smaller star is \u03c0 \\* (0.5 R_1)^2 = 0.25 \\* \u03c0 \\* R_1^2. The area of the larger star is \u03c0 \\* R_1^2. Therefore, the ratio of the areas is 0.25.

  "Step 1: Understand the problem and the given information. The problem is asking us to compute the rotation curve of the Galaxy, which is the velocity of stars in circular orbits at large distances from the center of the galaxy. The galaxy is assumed to have a spherically symmetric dark-matter halo with a density distribution given by \\(\\rho_{\\text {dark }}(r)=\\rho_{0}\\left(\\frac{r_{0}}{r}\\right)^{2}\\), where \\(\\rho_{0}\\) and \\(r_{0}\\) are constants, and \\(r\\) is the radial distance from the center of the galaxy. We are told to ignore the gravitational contribution of ordinary matter in the Galaxy for star orbits far out in the halo.\n\nStep 2: Recall the formula for the gravitational potential due to a spherically symmetric mass distribution. The gravitational potential at a distance \\(r\\) from the center of a spherically symmetric mass distribution is given by:\n\n\\[V(r) = -\\int_{0}^{r} \\frac{GM(r')}{r'} dr' \\]\n\nwhere \\(M(r')\\) is the mass enclosed within a radius \\(r'\\), and \\(G\\) is the gravitational constant.\n\nStep 3: Compute the mass enclosed within a radius \\(r\\) for the given dark-matter halo density distribution. The mass enclosed within a radius \\(r\\) is given by:\n\n\\[M(r) = \\int_{0}^{r} \\rho(r') 4\\pi r'^2 dr' \\]\n\nSubstituting the given density distribution \\(\\rho_{\\text {dark }}(r)=\\rho_{0}\\left(\\frac{r_{0}}{r}\\right)^2\\), we get:\n\n\\[M(r) = \\int_{0}^{r} \\rho_{0}\\left(\\frac{r_{0}}{r'}\\right)^2 4\\pi r'^2 dr' \\]\n\n\\[M(r) = 4\\pi \\rho_{0} r_{0}^2 \\int_{0}^{r} \\frac{r'^2}{r'^2} dr' \\]\n\n\\[M(r) = 4\\pi \\rho_{0} r_{0}^2 \\int_{0}^{r} dr' \\]\n\n\\[M(r) = 4\\pi \\rho_{0} r_{0}^2 r \\]\n\nStep 4: Compute the gravitational potential \\(V(r)\\) using the mass enclosed within a radius \\(r\\). Substituting \\(M(r) = 4\\pi \\rho_{0} r_{0}^2 r\\) into the formula for \\(V(r)\\), we get:\n\n\\[V(r) = -\\int_{0}^{r} \\frac{GM(r')}{r'} dr' \\]\n\n\\[V(r) = -\\int_{0}^{r} \\frac{G 4\\pi \\rho_{0} r_{0}^2 r'}{r'} dr' \\]\n\n\\[V(r) = -4\\pi G \\rho_{0} r_{0}^2 \\int_{0}^{r} dr' \\]\n\n\\[V(r) = -4\\pi G \\rho_{0} r_{0}^2 r \\]\n\nStep 5: Compute the force \\(F(r)\\) acting on a test particle at a distance \\(r\\) from the center of the galaxy. The force is given by:\n\n\\[F(r) = -\\frac{dV(r)}{dr} \\]\n\n\\[F(r) = -\\frac{d}{dr} (-4\\pi G \\rho_{0} r_{0}^2 r) \\]\n\n\\[F(r) = 4\\pi G \\rho_{0} r_{0}^2 \\]\n\nStep 6: Compute the velocity \\(v(r)\\) of a test particle in a circular orbit at a distance \\(r\\) from the center of the galaxy. The velocity is given by:\n\n\\[v(r) = \\sqrt{\\frac{F(r)}{m}} \\]\n\nwhere \\(m\\) is the mass of the test particle. Substituting \\(F(r) = 4\\pi G \\rho_{0} r_{0}^2\\), we get:\n\n\\[v(r) = \\sqrt{\\frac{4\\pi G \\rho_{0} r_{0}^2}{m}} \\]\n\nStep 7: Simplify the expression for \\(v(r)\\). Since the constants \\(\\rho_{0}\\), \\(r_{0}\\), \\(G\\), and \\(m\\) are all constants, we can write:\n\n\\[v(r) = \\sqrt{\\frac{4\\pi G \\rho_{0} r_{0}^2}{m}} \\]\n\n\\[v(r) = \\sqrt{\\frac{4\\pi G

  "Step 1: The problem requires us to calculate the angular resolution of the Very Large Array (VLA) telescope. The VLA has an effective diameter of 36 km, and a typical wavelength used for observation is 6 cm. We need to use this information to estimate the angular resolution in arcseconds.\n\nStep 2: The angular resolution of a telescope is determined by the formula: \u03b8 = 1.22 * \u03bb / D, where \u03b8 is the angular resolution, \u03bb is the wavelength, and D is the diameter of the telescope. Here, \u03bb is given in meters, and D is given in meters as well. Therefore, we need to convert the given wavelength from centimeters to meters and the diameter from kilometers to meters.\n\nStep 3: Convert the wavelength from centimeters to meters: 6 cm = 6 * 10^-2 m = 0.06 m.\n\nStep 4: Convert the diameter from kilometers to meters: 36 km = 36 * 10^3 m = 36,000 m.\n\nStep 5: Now, we can plug these values into the formula: \u03b8 = 1.22 * \u03bb / D = 1.22 * 0.06 m / 36,000 m.\n\nStep 6: Perform the calculation: \u03b8 = 1.22 * 0.06 / 36,000 = 1.22 * 0.06 / 36,000 = 0.0000216 radians.\n\nStep 7: Convert radians to arcseconds: 1 radian = 206265 arcseconds. Therefore, 0.0000216 radians = 0.0000216 * 206265 arcseconds \u2248 4.45 arcseconds.\n\nStep 8: Therefore, the estimated angular resolution of the VLA is approximately 4.45 arcseconds.\n\nStep 9: Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{4.45}",

The wavelength \u03bb is 600 nanometers, and the diameter D is 2.5 meters. First, convert the wavelength from nanometers to meters:\n\n\u03bb = 600 nm = 600 * 10^(-9) m = 6 * 10^(-7) m\n\nThen, compute the angular resolution:\n\n\u03b8 = 1.22 * (6 * 10^(-7) m) / (2.5 m)\n\nStep 4: Perform the calculation.\n\n\u03b8 = 1.22 * (6 * 10^(-7) m) / (2.5 m) = 1.22 * 2.4 * 10^(-7) = 2.928 * 10^(-7) radians\n\nStep 5: Convert the angular resolution from radians to arcseconds.

Let's denote the angle of incidence in water as \u03b8_w and the angle of refraction in air as \u03b8_a. Applying Snell's Law:\n\n1.3 sin(\u03b8_w) = 1.0 sin(\u03b8_a)\n\nStep 4: Solve for \u03b8_a\nTo find \u03b8_a, we can rearrange the equation:\n\nsin(\u03b8_a) = (1.3 / 1.0) sin(\u03b8_w)\n\nTherefore, \u03b8_a = arcsin((1.3 / 1.0) sin(\u03b8_w))\n\nStep 5: Express \u03b8_a in terms of \u03b8_w\nSo, the angle of the light once it emerges from the water into the air, \u03b8_a, is equal to the arcsine of (1.3 times the sine of \u03b8_w).\n\nTherefore, the expression for \u03b8_a in terms of \u03b8_w is:\n\n\u03b8_a = arcsin(1.3 sin(\u03b8_w))\n\nStep 6: Write the final answer\nThe angle of the light once it emerges from the water into the air, \u03b8_a, is given by:\n\n\u03b8_a = arcsin(1.3 sin(\u03b8_w))\n\nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{arcsin(1.3 sin(\u03b8_w))}",

The binding energy is the energy required to remove a mass \u0394M from the surface of the neutron star to infinity. This energy is given by the gravitational potential energy of the mass \u0394M at the surface of the neutron star.\n\nStep 3: The gravitational potential energy of a mass \u0394M at the surface of a neutron star with mass M and radius R is given by:\n\n\\[ \\Delta E = -\\frac{G M \\Delta M}{R} \\]\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant.\n\nStep 4: The fraction of the rest mass energy released is then given by the ratio of the energy released to the rest mass energy of the mass \u0394M. The rest mass energy of \u0394M is given by:\n\n\\[ E_{rest} = \\Delta M c^2 \\]\n\nwhere c is the speed of light.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, the fraction of the rest mass energy released is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\Delta E}{E_{rest}} = \\frac{-\\frac{G M \\Delta M}{R}}{\\Delta M c^2} = -\\frac{G M}{R c^2} \\]\n\nStep 6: We need to calculate this fraction for the given parameters: M = 1 M_{\\odot}, R = 10 km, and \u0394M = 1 kg (assuming a small mass \u0394M).\n\nStep 7: First, we need to convert the mass M from solar masses to kilograms. 1 M_{\\odot} = 1.989 x 10^{30} kg.\n\nStep 8: The radius R is given in kilometers, so we need to convert it to meters: 10 km = 10,000 m.\n\nStep 9: The gravitational constant G is 6.674 x 10^{-11} N m^2 kg^{-2}.\n\nStep 10: The speed of light c is 299,792,458 m/s.\n\nStep 11: Plugging in the values, we get:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\Delta E}{E_{rest}} = -\\frac{G M}{R c^2} = -\\frac{(6.674 x 10^{-11}) (1.989 x 10^{30})}{(10,000) (299,792,458)^2} \\]\n\nStep 12: Calculating the numerator:\n\n\\[ (6.674 x 10^{-11}) (1.989 x 10^{30}) = 1.327 x 10^{20} \\]\n\nStep 13: Calculating the denominator:\n\n\\[ (10,000) (299,792,458)^2 = 8.987 x 10^{17} \\]\n\nStep 14: Therefore, the fraction is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\Delta E}{E_{rest}} = -\\frac{1.327 x 10^{20}}{8.987 x 10^{17}} = -1.478 x 10^{-2} \\]\n\nStep 15: Therefore, the fraction of the rest mass energy released is approximately -1.478 x 10^{-2} or -1.478%.\n\nStep 16: Since the energy released is negative, it means that the energy is released as radiation, but the fraction is very small.\n\nStep 17: Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{-0.01478}",

The task is to find an expression for \\( \\omega(r) \\), the angular velocity, in terms of \\( r \\), \\( r_{0} \\), and \\( v_{0} \\).\n\nStep 2: Recall the relationship between linear velocity and angular velocity\nThe angular velocity \\( \\omega \\) is related to the linear velocity \\( v \\) by the equation:\n\\[ v = r \\omega \\]\nTherefore, to find \\( \\omega \\), we need to rearrange this equation to solve for \\( \\omega \\):\n\\[ \\omega = \\frac{v}{r} \\]\n\nStep 3: Substitute the given rotation curve into the equation for angular velocity\nSubstitute the given expression for \\( v(r) \\) into the equation for \\( \\omega \\):\n\\[ \\omega = \\frac{v(r)}{r} \\]\n\\[ \\omega = \\frac{\\frac{\\left(\\frac{r}{r_{0}}\\right)}{\\left(1+\\frac{r}{r_{0}}\\right)^{3/2}} v_{0}}{r} \\]\n\nStep 4: Simplify the expression for angular velocity\nTo simplify, we can first multiply the numerator and denominator by \\( r_{0} \\) to get rid of the fraction in the numerator:\n\\[ \\omega = \\frac{\\frac{r}{r_{0}}}{\\left(1+\\frac{r}{r_{0}}\\right)^{3/2}} \\frac{v_{0}}{r} \\]\n\\[ \\omega = \\frac{r}{r_{0}} \\frac{v_{0}}{r \\left(1+\\frac{r}{r_{0}}\\right)^{3/2}} \\]\n\\[ \\omega = \\frac{v_{0}}{r_{0} \\left(1+\\frac{r}{r_{0}}\\right)^{3/2}} \\]\n\nStep 5: Final expression for angular velocity\nTherefore, the expression for \\( \\omega(r) \\) is:\n\\[ \\omega(r) = \\frac{v_{0}}{r_{0} \\left(1+\\frac{r}{r_{0}}\\right)^{3/2}} \\]\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{\\frac{v_{0}}{r_{0} \\left(1+\\frac{r}{r_{0}}\\right)^{3/2}}}",
  "Step 1:  The problem describes a binary system consisting of two stars in circular orbit about a common center of mass. We are given the orbital period, \\(P_{\\text {orb }}=10\\) days, the orbital speed of Star 1, \\(v_{1}=20 \\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}\\), and the orbital radius of Star 2, \\(r_{2}=3 \\times 10^{12} \\mathrm{~cm}=3 \\times 10^{10} \\mathrm{~m}\\). We need to find the orbital radius, \\(r_{1}\\), of the optical star (Star 1) about the center of mass, in centimeters.\n\nStep 2:  To solve this problem, we can use the principles of orbital mechanics. Since the stars are in circular orbits, we can apply the formula for the orbital period of a binary system, which is given by Kepler's third law. However, in this case, we are given the orbital period and the orbital speed of one star, so we can use the relationship between the orbital speed, orbital radius, and the mass of the system.\n\nStep 3:  First, let's recall that for a binary system in circular orbit, the orbital speed of each star is given by \\(v = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}}\\), where \\(G\\) is the gravitational constant, \\(M\\) is the total mass of the system, and \\(r\\) is the orbital radius of the star. Since the stars are in circular orbits, the orbital speed is constant.\n\nStep 4:  We can use the given orbital speed of Star 1, \\(v_{1}=20 \\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}\\), to find the orbital radius, \\(r_{1}\\), of Star 1. We can rearrange the formula to solve for \\(r\\): \\(r = \\frac{GM}{v^2}\\).\n\nStep 5:  However, we need to find the total mass of the system, \\(M\\). Since the stars are in circular orbits, the total mass is the sum of the masses of the two stars. Let's denote the mass of Star 1 as \\(m_1\\) and the mass of Star 2 as \\(m_2\\). Then, the total mass is \\(M = m_1 + m_2\\).\n\nStep 6:  We can use the given orbital radius of Star 2, \\(r_2 = 3 \\times 10^{12} \\mathrm{~cm}\\), to find the mass of Star 2. Since the orbital speed of Star 2 is not given, we can use the fact that the orbital speed is constant in a circular orbit. Therefore, the orbital speed of Star 2 is also \\(v = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r_2}}\\).\n\nStep 7:  Since the total mass is the same for both stars, we can equate the orbital speeds: \\(v_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r_1}}\\) and \\(v_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r_2}}\\). Therefore, \\(\\frac{v_1}{v_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{r_2}{r_1}}\\).\n\nStep 8:  We can rearrange this equation to solve for \\(r_1\\): \\(r_1 = \\frac{r_2}{\\left(\\frac{v_1}{v_2}\\right)^2}\\).\n\nStep 9:  However, we need to find the mass of Star 2 first. Since the orbital speed of Star 2 is not given, we can use the fact that the orbital period is the same for both stars. Therefore, the orbital periods are related by the ratio of the orbital radii: \\(\\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \\frac{r_2}{r_1}\\).\n\nStep 10:  We can rearrange this equation to solve for \\(r_1\\): \\(r_1 = \\frac{r_2}{\\frac{P_1}{P_2}}\\).\n\nStep 11:  Therefore, we can find the orbital radius of Star 1 by dividing the orbital radius of Star 2 by the ratio of the orbital periods.\n\nStep 12:  First, let's convert the orbital period from days to seconds: \\(P_{\\text {orb }}=10 \\text{ days} = 10 \\times 24 \\times 60 \\times 60 \\text{ s} = 864000 \\text{ s}\\).\n\nStep 13:  Then, the ratio of the orbital periods is \\(\\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \\frac{864000}{P_2}\\).\n\nStep 14:  Therefore, the orbital radius of Star 1 is \\(r_1 = \\frac{r_2}{\\frac{P_1}{P_2}} = \\frac{r_2}{\\frac{864000}{P_2}} = \\frac{r_2 P_2}{864000}\\).\n\nStep 15:  Plugging in the given values, we have \\(r_1 = \\frac{(3 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ cm}) \\times P_2}{864000}\\).\n\nStep 16:  However, we need to find the orbital period of Star 2. Since the orbital periods are related by the ratio of the orbital radii, we can use the fact that the total mass is the same for both stars. Therefore, the orbital periods are related by the ratio of the orbital radii: \\(\\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \\frac{r_2}{r_1}\\).\n\nStep 17:  Therefore, \\(P_2 = \\frac{r_1}{r_2} P_1\\).\n\nStep 18:  Plugging this into the expression for \\(r_1\\), we have \\(r_1 = \\frac{r_2}{\\frac{P_1}{P_2}} = \\frac{r_2}{\\frac{P_1}{\\frac{r_1}{r_2} P_1}} = \\frac{r_2}{\\frac{1}{\\frac{r_1}{r_2}}} = \\frac{r_2}{\\frac{r_2}{r_1}} = \\frac{r_1^2}{r_2}\\).\n\nStep 19:  Therefore, \\(r_1^2 = r_2 \\times r_1\\).\n\nStep 20:  Therefore, \\(r_1^2 - r_1 \\times r_2 = 0\\).\n\nStep 21:  Therefore, \\(r_1 (r_1 - r_2) = 0\\).\n\nStep 22:  Therefore, either \\(r_1 = 0\\) or \\(r_1 = r_2\\).\n\nStep 23:  However, since the stars are in circular orbits, the orbital radius cannot be zero. Therefore, \\(r_1 = r_2\\).\n\nStep 24:  Therefore, the orbital radius of Star 1 is equal to the orbital radius of Star 2.\n\nStep 25:  Therefore, the orbital radius of Star 1 is \\(r_1 = 3 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ cm}\\).\n\nStep 26:  Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{3 \\times 10^{12}}",

  "Step 1: The problem states that we have a radio interferometer with 100 small dishes, each 1 m in diameter, distributed randomly within a 1 km diameter circle. The wavelength is 1 cm. We need to find the angular resolution of the interferometer array for a source directly overhead.\n\nStep 2: The angular resolution of a single dish is given by the wavelength divided by its diameter. In this case, the wavelength is 1 cm and the diameter of each dish is 1 m. So, the angular resolution of a single dish is 1 cm / 1 m = 0.01 radians.\n\nStep 3: The angular resolution of the interferometer array for a source directly overhead is given by the baseline length divided by the wavelength. The baseline length is the maximum distance between two dishes. Since the dishes are distributed randomly within a 1 km diameter circle, the maximum distance between two dishes is the diameter of the circle, which is 1 km = 1000 m.\n\nStep 4: Therefore, the angular resolution of the interferometer array for a source directly overhead is 1000 m / 1 cm = 1000 m / 0.01 m = 100000 radians.\n\nStep 5: However, the angular resolution is typically expressed in radians, and the value 100000 radians seems too large.

  "Step 1: Understand the problem and the given parameters. The problem asks for the collision mean free path of air molecules, given their collision cross section and number density. The collision cross section is \\(10^{-16} \\mathrm{~cm}^{2}\\), and the number density is \\(10^{19} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}\\). We need to calculate the mean free path to one significant figure.\n\nStep 2: Recall the formula for the mean free path. The mean free path (\\(\\lambda\\)) is given by the formula \\(\\lambda = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2} \\pi d^2 n}\\), where \\(d\\) is the diameter of the molecule (which is related to the cross section), and \\(n\\) is the number density of the molecules. However, the formula can also be expressed as \\(\\lambda = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2} \\pi \\sigma n}\\), where \\(\\sigma\\) is the collision cross section. Since the cross section is given, we can use this formula.\n\nStep 3: Plug in the given values into the formula. The collision cross section \\(\\sigma = 10^{-16} \\mathrm{~cm}^{2}\\), and the number density \\(n = 10^{19} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}\\). Substituting these into the formula gives \\(\\lambda = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2} \\pi (10^{-16}) (10^{19})}\\).\n\nStep 4: Perform the calculation. First, calculate the product inside the denominator: \\(10^{-16} \\times 10^{19} = 10^{3}\\). Then, multiply by \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(\\pi\\): \\(\\sqrt{2} \\pi \\times 10^{3}\\). Finally, take the reciprocal to find the mean free path.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the product \\(\\sqrt{2} \\pi \\times 10^{3}\\). \\(\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414\\), \\(\\pi \\approx 3.1416\\), so \\(\\sqrt{2} \\pi \\approx 1.414 \\times 3.1416 \\approx 4.442\\). Then, \\(4.442 \\times 10^{3} \\approx 4442\\). The reciprocal of 4442 is approximately 0.000225.\n\nStep 6: Round the result to one significant figure. The mean free path is approximately 0.000225 cm. Rounded to one significant figure, this is 0.0002 cm.\n\nStep 7: Write the final answer in the required format.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{0.0002}",
  "Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are given two stars with the same surface temperature. Star 1 has a radius that is 2.5 times larger than the radius of star 2. Additionally, star 1 is ten times farther away than star 2. We need to find the absolute value of the difference in apparent magnitude between the two stars, rounded to the nearest integer.\n\nStep 2: Recall the formula for apparent magnitude\nThe apparent magnitude of a star is related to its luminosity and distance from the observer. The formula is:\n\nm = -2.5 log10 (L / L0) + M\n\nwhere m is the apparent magnitude, L is the luminosity of the star, L0 is a reference luminosity (usually the luminosity of a star with a magnitude of 0), and M is the absolute magnitude of the star.\n\nHowever, since the surface temperature is the same for both stars, their luminosities are proportional to their radii squared. Therefore, we can express the luminosity of each star in terms of their radii.\n\nStep 3: Express luminosity in terms of radius\nSince the surface temperature is the same for both stars, their luminosities are proportional to their radii squared. Let's denote the radius of star 2 as r2. Then, the radius of star 1 is 2.5r2. Therefore, the luminosity of star 1 is (2.5r2)^2 = 6.25r2^2, and the luminosity of star 2 is r2^2.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the apparent magnitude of each star\nLet's denote the distance to star 1 as d1 and the distance to star 2 as d2. We are given that d1 = 10d2. The apparent magnitude of each star can be calculated using the formula:\n\nm = -2.5 log10 (L / L0) + M\n\nSince the luminosities are proportional to the radii squared, we can write:\n\nm1 = -2.5 log10 (6.25r2^2 / L0) + M1\nm2 = -2.5 log10 (r2^2 / L0) + M2\n\nStep 5: Calculate the difference in apparent magnitude\nWe need to find the absolute value of the difference in apparent magnitude between the two stars. Let's denote the difference as \u0394m = |m1 - m2|.\n\nStep 6: Simplify the expression for \u0394m\nSubtracting the two equations for m1 and m2, we get:\n\n\u0394m = -2.5 log10 (6.25r2^2 / L0) + M1 - (-2.5 log10 (r2^2 / L0) + M2)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n\u0394m = -2.5 log10 (6.25) + (M1 - M2)\n\nSince the luminosities are proportional to the radii squared, the absolute magnitudes M1 and M2 are related to the radii. Let's denote the absolute magnitude of star 2 as M2. Then, the absolute magnitude of star 1 is M1 = M2 + 2.5 log10 (6.25) = M2 + 2.5 log10 (6.25).\n\nTherefore, \u0394m = -2.5 log10 (6.25) + (M2 + 2.5 log10 (6.25) - M2) = -2.5 log10 (6.25) + 2.5 log10 (6.25) = 0.\n\nHowever, this is not correct.

  "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the luminosity of objects, their flux at the observer, and the number of objects observed per square degree on the sky. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's recall that the flux \\(F\\) at the observer is related to the luminosity \\(L\\) of an object by the distance \\(d\\) between the object and the observer:\n\n\\[F = \\frac{L}{4\\pi d^2}\\]\n\nSince we are dealing with a homogeneous distribution of objects, the number of objects per unit area (in this case, per square degree) is constant.

Let \\(N(>F)\\) be the number of objects with flux greater than \\(F\\).

  "Problem: A Boolean function $F(A, B)$ is said to be universal if any arbitrary boolean function can be constructed by using nested $F(A, B)$ functions. A universal function is useful, since using it we can build any function we wish out of a single part. For example, when implementing boolean logic on a computer chip a universal function (called a 'gate' in logic-speak) can simplify design enormously. We would like to find a universal boolean function. In this problem we will denote the two boolean inputs $A$ and $B$ and the one boolean output as $C$. \n\nFirst, to help us organize our thoughts, let's enumerate all of the functions we'd like to be able to construct. How many different possible one-output boolean functions of two variables are there? I.e., how many functions are there of the form $F(A, B)=C ?$\n\nLet's start by listing all possible functions of two variables. Since each variable can be either 0 or 1, there are 2^2 = 4 possible input combinations: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). For each of these, the output C can be either 0 or 1. So, for each input combination, there are 2 possible outputs. Therefore, the total number of possible functions is 2^4 = 16. So, we need to find a function F(A, B) such that any of these 16 functions can be constructed using nested F(A, B) functions.\n\nLet's denote the output of F(A, B) as C. Then, we can write C = F(A, B). Now, we need to show that any of the 16 possible functions can be constructed using nested F(A, B) functions.\n\nLet's denote the 16 possible functions as f1, f2, ..., f16. Each function fi is a mapping from {0,1}^2 to {0,1}. For example, f1(0,0) = 0, f1(0,1) = 1, f1(1,0) = 0, f1(1,1) = 1. Similarly for f2, ..., f16.\n\nWe need to show that for any function fi, there exists a sequence of F(A, B) functions such that the output of the last F(A, B) is equal to fi(A, B).\n\nLet's start by considering the possible values of F(A, B). Since F(A, B) is a boolean function, its output C can be either 0 or 1. Therefore, F(A, B) can be one of the following four functions:\n\n1. F(A, B) = 0\n2. F(A, B) = 1\n3. F(A, B) = A\n4. F(A, B) = B\n\nLet's consider each of these cases.\n\nCase 1: F(A, B) = 0\n\nIn this case, the output C is always 0, regardless of the inputs A and B. Therefore, any function fi that outputs 0 for all inputs can be constructed using F(A, B) = 0. For example, if fi(0,0) = 0, fi(0,1) = 0, fi(1,0) = 0, fi(1,1) = 0, then we can set C = 0, which satisfies fi(A, B) = C.\n\nSimilarly, if fi(0,0) = 0, fi(0,1) = 0, fi(1,0) = 0, fi(1,1) = 1, then we can set C = 0 for inputs (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), and C = 1 for input (1,1). Therefore, we can construct fi using F(A, B) = 0.\n\nCase 2: F(A, B) = 1\n\nSimilarly, if F(A, B) = 1, then the output C is always 1, regardless of the inputs A and B. Therefore, any function fi that outputs 1 for all inputs can be constructed using F(A, B) = 1.\n\nCase 3: F(A, B) = A\n\nIn this case, the output C is equal to A. Therefore, any function fi that depends only on A can be constructed using F(A, B) = A. For example, if fi(0,0) = 0, fi(0,1) = 0, fi(1,0) = 1, fi(1,1) = 1, then we can set C = A, which satisfies fi(A, B) = C.\n\nSimilarly, if fi(0,0) = 0, fi(0,1) = 1, fi(1,0) = 0, fi(1,1) = 1, then we can set C = A for inputs (0,0), (1,0), and C = B for inputs (0,1), (1,1). Therefore, we can construct fi using F(A, B) = A.\n\nCase 4: F(A, B) = B\n\nSimilarly, if F(A, B) = B, then the output C is equal to B. Therefore, any function fi that depends only on B can be constructed using F(A, B) = B.\n\nTherefore, in all four cases, we can construct any function fi using nested F(A, B) functions. Therefore, F(A, B) is universal.\n\nTherefore, the function F(A, B) = A XOR B is universal.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{1}",

The rate of inflow is the concentration of salt in the first tank multiplied by the rate of outflow from the first tank, which is r liters/minute. The rate of outflow from the second tank is also r liters/minute. Therefore, the differential equation for the second tank is:\n\ny' = (r/V)x - rc\n\nHowever, since the second tank is initially empty, the initial condition is y(1) = 0. But the problem states that at time t = 1, the water in the second tank has no salt in it. Therefore, the initial condition for the second tank is y(0) = 0, not y(1) = 0. So the differential equation for the second tank is:\n\ny' = (r/V)x - rc\n\nwith initial condition y(0) = 0.\n\nStep 5: Solve the differential equation for the second tank\nTo solve the differential equation y' = (r/V)x - rc with initial condition y(0) = 0, we can use the method of integrating factors or separation of variables.\n\nLet's use separation of variables. Rearrange the equation to get:\n\ndy/dt = (r/V)x - rc\n\nSeparate variables:\n\ndy = (r/V)x - rc dt\n\nIntegrate both sides:\n\n\u222bdy = \u222b[(r/V)x - rc]dt\n\ny = (r/V)\u222bx dt - rc t + C\n\nwhere C is the constant of integration.\n\nSince y(0) = 0, substitute t = 0 and y = 0:\n\n0 = (r/V)\u222bx(0) dt - rc(0) + C\n\nC = 0\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\ny = (r/V)\u222bx dt - rc t\n\nStep 6: Express x(t) using the differential equation for the first tank\nThe differential equation for the first tank is:\n\nx' + (r/V)x - rc = 0\n\nThis is a linear differential equation. The solution to this equation is:\n\nx(t) = (rc + Ae^(-rt/V))\n\nwhere A is a constant.\n\nTo find A, use the initial condition x(0) = x0, where x0 is the initial amount of salt in the first tank. Therefore:\n\nx(0) = (rc + A)\n\nA = x0 - rc\n\nTherefore, the solution for x(t) is:\n\nx(t) = (rc + (x0 - rc)e^(-rt/V))\n\nSubstitute this expression for x(t) into the solution for y(t):\n\ny = (r/V)\u222b[(rc + (x0 - rc)e^(-rt/V))] dt - rc t\n\nStep 7: Evaluate the integral\nTo evaluate the integral, let's break it into two parts:\n\n\u222b[(rc + (x0 - rc)e^(-rt/V))] dt\n\n= \u222brc dt + \u222b(x0 - rc)e^(-rt/V) dt\n\nThe first integral is:\n\n\u222brc dt = rc t\n\nThe second integral is:\n\n\u222b(x0 - rc)e^(-rt/V) dt\n\nLet u = -rt/V:\n\ndu/dt = -r/V\n\ndt = -V du / r\n\nSubstitute:\n\n\u222b(x0 - rc)e^(-rt/V) dt = -V (x0 - rc) \u222be^u du / r\n\n= -V (x0 - rc) e^u / r\n\nSubstitute back:\n\n= -V (x0 - rc) e^(-rt/V) / r\n\nTherefore, the solution for y(t) is:\n\ny = (r/V) [rc t - V (x0 - rc) e^(-rt/V) / r] - rc t\n\nSimplify:\n\ny = (r/V) [rc t - (x0 - rc) e^(-rt/V)] - rc t\n\ny = (r/V) [rc t - x0 e^(-rt/V) + rc e^(-rt/V)] - rc t\n\ny = rc t - (x0/V) e^(-rt/V) + rc e^(-rt/V) - rc t\n\ny = - (x0/V) e^(-rt/V) + rc e^(-rt/V)\n\nTherefore, the solution for y(t) is:\n\ny(t) = - (x0/V) e^(-rt/V) + rc e^(-rt/V)\n\nStep 8: Write down the final answer\nThe differential equation for the amount of salt in the second tank is:\n\ny' = (r/V)x - rc\n\nwith initial condition y(0) = 0.\n\nThe solution for y(t) is:\n\ny(t) = - (x0/V) e^(-rt/V) + rc e^(-rt/V)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\ny(t) = - (x0/V) e^(-rt/V) + rc e^(-rt/V)\n\nSo the final answer is \\boxed{- (x0/V) e^(-rt/V) + rc e^(-rt/V)}",
  "Step 1: Identify the differential equation and its form. The given differential equation is \\(x^{2} y^{\\prime} + 2x y = \\sin(2x)\\). This is a first-order linear differential equation in the form \\(x^{2} y^{\\prime} + 2x y = f(x)\\), where \\(f(x) = \\sin(2x)\\).\n\nStep 2: Determine the integrating factor. For a differential equation in the form \\(x^{2} y^{\\prime} + 2x y = f(x)\\), the integrating factor is given by \\(e^{\\int \\frac{2}{x} dx} = e^{2 \\ln x} = x^{2}\\). Therefore, multiplying both sides of the equation by \\(x^{2}\\) will make the left-hand side the derivative of a product.\n\nStep 3: Multiply both sides of the equation by the integrating factor. Multiplying both sides by \\(x^{2}\\) gives: \\(x^{2} (x^{2} y^{\\prime} + 2x y) = x^{2} \\sin(2x)\\). This simplifies to \\((x^{2})^{2} y^{\\prime} + 2x^{3} y = x^{2} \\sin(2x)\\).\n\nStep 4: Write the left-hand side as the derivative of a product. The left-hand side is \\((x^{2})^{2} y^{\\prime} + 2x^{3} y\\). This can be written as \\(\\frac{d}{dx} (x^{4} y)\\). Therefore, the equation becomes \\(\\frac{d}{dx} (x^{4} y) = x^{2} \\sin(2x)\\).\n\nStep 5: Integrate both sides with respect to x. Integrating both sides gives: \\(\\int \\frac{d}{dx} (x^{4} y) dx = \\int x^{2} \\sin(2x) dx\\).

Therefore, \\(\\int x \\cos(2x) dx = \\frac{1}{2} x \\sin(2x) - \\int \\frac{1}{2} \\sin(2x) dx\\).\n\nStep 8: Evaluate the integral of \\(\\sin(2x)\\). The integral of \\(\\sin(2x)\\) is \\(-\\frac{1}{2} \\cos(2x)\\). Therefore, \\(\\int \\frac{1}{2} \\sin(2x) dx = -\\frac{1}{4} \\cos(2x)\\). Therefore, \\(\\int x \\cos(2x) dx = \\frac{1}{2} x \\sin(2x) - \\left(-\\frac{1}{4} \\cos(2x)\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} x \\sin(2x) + \\frac{1}{4} \\cos(2x)\\).\n\nStep 9: Combine the results.

  "Problem: Find the complex number $a+b i$ with the smallest possible positive $b$ such that $e^{a+b i}=1+\\sqrt{3} i$.Step 1: The problem asks us to find the complex number \\( a + bi \\) with the smallest possible positive \\( b \\) such that \\( e^{a + bi} = 1 + \\sqrt{3} i \\). To approach this, we need to use the properties of complex exponentials and Euler's formula.\n\nStep 2: Euler's formula states that for any complex number \\( z = a + bi \\), the exponential function can be expressed as \\( e^z = e^a (\\cos(b) + i \\sin(b)) \\). Therefore, if \\( e^{a + bi} = 1 + \\sqrt{3} i \\), then we can equate the real and imaginary parts to find the values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\nStep 3: Let's express \\( 1 + \\sqrt{3} i \\) in polar form. The magnitude is \\( \\sqrt{1^2 + (\\sqrt{3})^2} = 2 \\), and the angle \\( \\theta \\) is given by \\( \\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{1} = \\sqrt{3} \\), so \\( \\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\). Therefore, \\( 1 + \\sqrt{3} i = 2e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{3}} \\).\n\nStep 4: Since \\( e^{a + bi} = 1 + \\sqrt{3} i = 2e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{3}} \\), we can equate the magnitudes and angles. The magnitude of \\( e^{a + bi} \\) is \\( e^a \\), so \\( e^a = 2 \\). The angle of \\( e^{a + bi} \\) is \\( b \\), so \\( b = \\frac{\\pi}{3} + 2k\\pi \\) for some integer \\( k \\). However, since we want the smallest positive \\( b \\), we need to find the smallest \\( k \\) such that \\( b > 0 \\).\n\nStep 5: Since \\( b = \\frac{\\pi}{3} + 2k\\pi \\), we need to find the smallest integer \\( k \\) such that \\( \\frac{\\pi}{3} + 2k\\pi > 0 \\). Let's solve for \\( k \\):\n\n\\( \\frac{\\pi}{3} + 2k\\pi > 0 \\)\n\n\\( 2k\\pi > -\\frac{\\pi}{3} \\)\n\n\\( k > -\\frac{1}{6} \\)\n\nSince \\( k \\) must be an integer, the smallest integer \\( k \\) that satisfies this inequality is \\( k = 0 \\).\n\nStep 6: Therefore, the smallest positive \\( b \\) is \\( b = \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\). Now, we need to find the corresponding \\( a \\) such that \\( e^a = 2 \\). Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get \\( a = \\ln(2) \\).\n\nStep 7: Therefore, the complex number \\( a + bi \\) with the smallest possible positive \\( b \\) such that \\( e^{a + bi} = 1 + \\sqrt{3} i \\) is \\( \\ln(2) + \\frac{\\pi}{3} i \\).\n\nStep 8: Therefore, the final answer is \\( \\boxed{\\ln(2) + \\frac{\\pi}{3} i} \\). However, since the problem asks for a numerical answer, we need to compute the numerical value of \\( \\ln(2) + \\frac{\\pi}{3} i \\). Since \\( \\ln(2) \\approx 0.693147 \\) and \\( \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\approx 1.047198 \\), the complex number is approximately \\( 0.693147 + 1.047198 i \\).\n\nStep 9: Therefore, the final numerical answer is \\( \\boxed{0.693147 + 1.047198 i} \\). However, since the problem asks for a numerical answer, we need to compute the numerical value of \\( 0.693147 + 1.047198 i \\).

The first derivative of sin(3t) is 3 cos(3t), so the second derivative is -9 sin(3t). Therefore, \\ddot{A sin(3t)} = -9 A sin(3t).\n\nStep 3: Substitute A sin(3t) for x and -9 A sin(3t) for \\ddot{x} in the differential equation \\ddot{x} + 4x = sin(3t).

  "Step 1: To rewrite the given function $\\cos (\\pi t)-\\sqrt{3} \\sin (\\pi t)$ in the form $A \\cos (\\omega t-\\phi)$, we can use the trigonometric identity for the cosine of a sum of two angles. The general form is $A \\cos (\\omega t-\\phi) = A \\cos (\\omega t) \\cos (\\phi) + A \\sin (\\omega t) \\sin (\\phi)$. Therefore, we need to express the given function in the form $A \\cos (\\omega t) \\cos (\\phi) + A \\sin (\\omega t) \\sin (\\phi)$.\n\nStep 2: The coefficients of the sine and cosine terms in the given function are -\u221a3 and 1, respectively. Therefore, we can write the function as $A \\cos (\\omega t) \\cos (\\phi) + A \\sin (\\omega t) \\sin (\\phi) = \\cos (\\pi t) - \\sqrt{3} \\sin (\\pi t)$.\n\nStep 3: Comparing the coefficients, we have A cos(\u03c6) = 1 and A sin(\u03c6) = -\u221a3. We can use these equations to find the values of A and \u03c6.\n\nStep 4: To find A, we can use the Pythagorean identity: A^2 = (A cos(\u03c6))^2 + (A sin(\u03c6))^2. Substituting the given values, we get A^2 = 1^2 + (-\u221a3)^2 = 1 + 3 = 4. Therefore, A = \u221a4 = 2.\n\nStep 5: Now that we have A = 2, we can find \u03c6 using the equations A cos(\u03c6) = 1 and A sin(\u03c6) = -\u221a3. Substituting A = 2, we get 2 cos(\u03c6) = 1 and 2 sin(\u03c6) = -\u221a3.\n\nStep 6: Dividing both equations by 2, we get cos(\u03c6) = 1/2 and sin(\u03c6) = -\u221a3/2. Therefore, \u03c6 is in the second quadrant, where cos(\u03c6) is positive and sin(\u03c6) is negative.\n\nStep 7: Since cos(\u03c6) = 1/2 and sin(\u03c6) = -\u221a3/2, we can use the unit circle to find the angle \u03c6. The point (1/2, -\u221a3/2) is in the second quadrant, where the cosine is positive and the sine is negative. The reference angle is 30\u00b0, so \u03c6 = 180\u00b0 - 30\u00b0 = 150\u00b0.\n\nStep 8: Therefore, the given function can be rewritten as 2 cos(\u03c0t - 150\u00b0).\n\nStep 9: However, the problem asks for the answer in the form A cos(\u03c9t - \u03c6), where \u03c9 is the frequency.

The forcing term is $\\cos (2 t)$.\n\nStep 2: Determine the characteristic equation.\nThe characteristic equation is obtained by substituting $x=e^{rt}$ into the differential equation. So, we have $\\ddot{x}+4 x=0$ becomes $r^2 e^{rt}+4 e^{rt}=0$. Dividing by $e^{rt}$, we get $r^2+4=0$. Therefore, the characteristic equation is $r^2+4=0$.\n\nStep 3: Solve the characteristic equation.\nThe characteristic equation is $r^2+4=0$. This is a quadratic equation with roots $r=\\pm 2i$. Therefore, the roots are complex conjugates.\n\nStep 4: Apply the ERF.\nSince the roots are complex conjugates, we can use the ERF with resonance. The ERF with resonance states that a solution to $p(D) x=A e^{r t}$ is given by $x_{p}=A \\frac{t e^{r t}}{p^{\\prime}(r)}$, as long as $\\left.p^{\\prime} ( r)\\right) \\neq 0$. In this case, $p(r)=r^2+4$ and $p^{\\prime}(r)=2r$. Therefore, $p^{\\prime}(r)=2r=2(2i)=4i \\neq 0$. So, we can apply the ERF with resonance.\n\nStep 5: Compute the solution.\nUsing the ERF with resonance, the solution is $x_{p}=A \\frac{t e^{r t}}{p^{\\prime}(r)}$. Plugging in $r=2i$, we get $x_{p}=A \\frac{t e^{2i t}}{4i}$. Simplifying, we have $x_{p}=\\frac{A t}{4i} e^{2i t}$. To simplify further, we can multiply by $e^{-i t}$ to get $x_{p}=\\frac{A t}{4i} e^{i t} e^{i t}=\\frac{A t}{4i} e^{2i t}$. Since $e^{2i t}=\\cos (2 t)+i \\sin (2 t)$, we have $x_{p}=\\frac{A t}{4i} (\\cos (2 t)+i \\sin (2 t))$. Multiplying by $i$, we get $x_{p}=\\frac{A t}{4} (-\\sin (2 t)+i \\cos (2 t))$. Therefore, the solution is $x_{p}=\\frac{A t}{4} (-\\sin (2 t)+i \\cos (2 t))$.\n\nStep 6: Determine the coefficient A.\nTo determine the coefficient A, we need to use the initial conditions. However, the problem does not specify the initial conditions. Therefore, we can assume that the solution is of the form $x(t)=x_{h}(t)+x_{p}(t)$, where $x_{h}(t)$ is the homogeneous solution and $x_{p}(t)$ is the particular solution. Since we have found the particular solution, we can write $x(t)=x_{h}(t)+\\frac{A t}{4} (-\\sin (2 t)+i \\cos (2 t))$. The homogeneous solution is $x_{h}(t)=c_{1} \\cos (2 t)+c_{2} \\sin (2 t)$.

This is a second-order linear homogeneous ODE with constant coefficients.\n\nStep 2: Identify the type of ODE\nThe given ODE is a second-order linear homogeneous ODE with constant coefficients. The general form of such an ODE is $\\ddot{x} + b\\dot{x} + cx = 0$, where $b$ and $c$ are constants. In our case, $b = 0$ and $c = -a^{2}$. Since $b = 0$, the ODE is of the form $\\ddot{x} - a^{2} x = 0$.\n\nStep 3: Solve the ODE\nTo solve the ODE, we can use the characteristic equation method. The characteristic equation is obtained by substituting $x = e^{rt}$ into the ODE. This gives the equation $r^{2} - a^{2} = 0$. Solving for $r$, we get $r = \\pm a$. Therefore, the general solution is $x(t) = c_{1} e^{at} + c_{2} e^{-at}$, where $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$ are arbitrary constants.\n\nStep 4: Apply the initial conditions\nWe are given the initial conditions $x(0) = 1$ and $\\dot{x}(0) = 0$. We can use these conditions to determine the values of $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$.\n\nFirst, we apply the initial condition $x(0) = 1$. Substituting $t = 0$ into the general solution, we get $1 = c_{1} + c_{2}$. Therefore, $c_{1} + c_{2} = 1$.\n\nNext, we apply the initial condition $\\dot{x}(0) = 0$. Differentiating the general solution with respect to $t$, we get $\\dot{x}(t) = a c_{1} e^{at} - a c_{2} e^{-at}$. Substituting $t = 0$, we get $0 = a c_{1} - a c_{2}$. Therefore, $c_{1} = c_{2}$.\n\nStep 5: Solve for c1 and c2\nWe have two equations: $c_{1} + c_{2} = 1$ and $c_{1} = c_{2}$. From the second equation, we can substitute $c_{2} = c_{1}$ into the first equation, which gives $c_{1} + c_{1} = 1$. Therefore, $2c_{1} = 1$, so $c_{1} = 1/2$. Since $c_{1} = c_{2}$, we also have $c_{2} = 1/2$.\n\nStep 6: Write the solution\nTherefore, the solution to the ODE is $x(t) = \\frac{1}{2} e^{at} + \\frac{1}{2} e^{-at}$.\n\nStep 7: Final answer\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2} e^{at} + \\frac{1}{2} e^{-at}}",

  "Step 1: The given differential equation is $\\ddot{x}+4x=\\sin(3t)$. We need to find the general solution in the form $f_0(t) + C_1f_1(t) + C_2f_2(t)$, where $C_1, C_2$ are arbitrary constants.\n\nStep 2: First, we need to find the complementary solution $f_0(t)$, which is the solution to the homogeneous equation $\\ddot{x}+4x=0$. This is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients.\n\nStep 3: The characteristic equation for this homogeneous equation is $r^2 + 4 = 0$. Solving for $r$, we get $r = \\pm 2i$. Therefore, the complementary solution is $f_0(t) = c_1 \\cos(2t) + c_2 \\sin(2t)$.\n\nStep 4: Next, we need to find a particular solution $f_p(t)$ that satisfies the nonhomogeneous equation $\\ddot{x}+4x=\\sin(3t)$. Since the right-hand side is a sine function, we can try a particular solution of the form $f_p(t) = A \\sin(3t) + B \\cos(3t)$.\n\nStep 5: Substituting $f_p(t)$ into the differential equation, we get $\\ddot{f_p}+4f_p=\\sin(3t)$.

  "Problem: Rewrite the function $\\operatorname{Re} \\frac{e^{i t}}{2+2 i}$ in the form $A \\cos (\\omega t-\\phi)$. It may help to begin by drawing a right triangle with sides $a$ and $b$.\n\nStep 1: To rewrite the function $\\operatorname{Re} \\frac{e^{i t}}{2+2 i}$ in the form $A \\cos (\\omega t-\\phi)$, we need to express the complex number $2+2i$ in polar form. This will help us simplify the expression and then convert it to the desired form.\n\nStep 2: First, let's convert the complex number $2+2i$ to polar form. The magnitude of the complex number is given by $\\sqrt{2^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$. The angle $\\theta$ can be found using the formula $\\theta = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{2}{2}\\right) = \\tan^{-1}(1) = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$.\n\nStep 3: Therefore, the polar form of $2+2i$ is $2\\sqrt{2}\\left(\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) + i\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\right)$.\n\nStep 4: Now, let's rewrite the original expression $\\frac{e^{i t}}{2+2 i}$ using the polar form of $2+2i$. We can do this by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is $2-2i$. This will eliminate the complex number in the denominator.\n\nStep 5: Multiplying the numerator and denominator by $2-2i$, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{e^{i t}}{2+2 i} = \\frac{e^{i t} (2-2i)}{(2+2i)(2-2i)}$$\n\nStep 6: Simplifying the denominator, we have:\n\n$$(2+2i)(2-2i) = 2^2 - (2i)^2 = 4 - 4i^2 = 4 + 4 = 8$$\n\nStep 7: Therefore, the expression becomes:\n\n$$\\frac{e^{i t} (2-2i)}{8}$$\n\nStep 8: Now, let's simplify the numerator. We can rewrite $e^{i t}$ as $\\cos(t) + i\\sin(t)$. Then, multiplying by $2-2i$, we get:\n\n$$(2-2i)(\\cos(t) + i\\sin(t)) = 2\\cos(t) - 2i\\cos(t) + 2i\\sin(t) - 2\\sin(t)$$\n\nStep 9: Combining like terms, we have:\n\n$$2\\cos(t) - 2\\sin(t) - 2i(\\cos(t) + \\sin(t))$$\n\nStep 10: Therefore, the numerator is $2\\cos(t) - 2\\sin(t) - 2i(\\cos(t) + \\sin(t))$.\n\nStep 11: So, the expression becomes:\n\n$$\\frac{2\\cos(t) - 2\\sin(t) - 2i(\\cos(t) + \\sin(t))}{8}$$\n\nStep 12: Now, let's separate the real and imaginary parts. The real part is:\n\n$$\\frac{2\\cos(t) - 2\\sin(t)}{8}$$\n\nStep 13: The imaginary part is:\n\n$$\\frac{-2i(\\cos(t) + \\sin(t))}{8} = \\frac{-2}{8}(\\cos(t) + \\sin(t)) = -\\frac{1}{4}(\\cos(t) + \\sin(t))$$\n\nStep 14: Therefore, the real part is $\\frac{1}{4}(\\cos(t) - \\sin(t))$.\n\nStep 15: Now, we need to express this in the form $A\\cos(\\omega t - \\phi)$. To do this, we can use the trigonometric identity:\n\n$$\\cos(t) - \\sin(t) = \\sqrt{2}\\left(\\cos\\left(t + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\right)$$\n\nStep 16: Therefore, the real part is:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{4}\\sqrt{2}\\left(\\cos\\left(t + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\\right)$$\n\nStep 17: So, the expression is:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{4}\\sqrt{2}\\cos\\left(t + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$$\n\nStep 18: Therefore, the amplitude $A$ is $\\frac{1}{4}\\sqrt{2}$, the frequency $\\omega$ is 1, and the phase shift $\\phi$ is $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$.\n\nStep 19: Therefore, the function can be written in the form:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{4}\\sqrt{2}\\cos\\left(t + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)$$\n\nStep 20: Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}\\sqrt{2}\\cos\\left(t + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)}$$",
  "Step 1: To determine the value of b for which the differential equation exhibits critical damping, we need to recall the definition of critical damping. Critical damping occurs when the discriminant of the characteristic polynomial is zero.\n\nStep 2: The characteristic polynomial of the given differential equation is p(s) = s^2 + b s + 1. The discriminant of a quadratic polynomial ax^2 + bx + c is given by b^2 - 4ac. In this case, a = 1, b = b, and c = 1.\n\nStep 3: Set the discriminant equal to zero: b^2 - 4ac = 0. Substitute the values of a, b, and c: b^2 - 4(1)(1) = 0.\n\nStep 4: Simplify the equation: b^2 - 4 = 0.\n\nStep 5: Solve for b: b^2 = 4. Taking the square root of both sides: b = \u00b1\u221a4 = \u00b12.\n\nStep 6: Therefore, the value of b for which the differential equation exhibits critical damping is b = 2 or b = -2.\n\nStep 7: However, since the problem does not specify whether b is positive or negative, we can conclude that the differential equation exhibits critical damping when b = 2 or b = -2.\n\nStep 8: Therefore, the final answer is b = 2 or b = -2.\n\nFinal answer: The final answer is \\boxed{2}",
  "Step 1: The given differential equation is \\(\\dot{z} + 2z = e^{2it}\\). To solve this, we can use an integrating factor or separate variables. However, since the right-hand side is an exponential function, it might be easier to use an integrating factor. Let's proceed with that.\n\nStep 2: The standard form of a first-order linear differential equation is \\(\\dot{z} + P(t)z = Q(t)\\), where \\(P(t)\\) and \\(Q(t)\\) are functions of \\(t\\). In our case, \\(P(t) = 2\\) and \\(Q(t) = e^{2it}\\). The integrating factor is given by \\(e^{\\int P(t) dt}\\). So, we need to compute \\(\\int 2 dt\\).\n\nStep 3: The integral of 2 with respect to t is 2t. Therefore, the integrating factor is \\(e^{2t}\\).\n\nStep 4: Multiply both sides of the original differential equation by the integrating factor, which is \\(e^{2t}\\). This gives us \\(e^{2t} \\dot{z} + 2e^{2t} z = e^{2t} e^{2it}\\).\n\nStep 5: The left-hand side is the derivative of \\(e^{2t} z\\), so we can rewrite the equation as \\(\\frac{d}{dt} (e^{2t} z) = e^{2t} e^{2it}\\).\n\nStep 6: Now, we can integrate both sides with respect to t.

  "Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem asks us to find the Laplace transform \\(W(s)\\) of the signal \\(w(t)\\), which is defined as the difference between two unit step functions shifted by time \\(T\\). The unit step function \\(u_{s}(t)\\) is defined as 0 for \\(t < 0\\) and 1 for \\(t \\geq 0\\).

  "Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are given a mass \\(m\\), a dashpot \\(c\\), and a spring \\(k\\). The mass is initially at rest and is connected to the spring and dashpot, with one end of the spring and dashpot attached to inertial space (reference velocity = 0). A unit step force is applied to the other end of the spring and dashpot. We need to find the resulting velocity of the mass.\n\nStep 2: Recall the equations of motion for the mass, spring, and dashpot\nThe equations of motion for the mass, spring, and dashpot can be described by the following differential equations:\n\n1. For the mass: \\(m \\frac{d^2 x}{d t^2} = F(t)\\), where \\(x\\) is the position of the mass and \\(F(t)\\) is the applied force.\n\n2. For the spring: \\(k (x - x_{s}) = 0\\), where \\(x_{s}\\) is the position of the spring's end attached to inertial space. Since the spring is connected to the mass, we can write \\(x_{s} = x\\). Therefore, the spring's equation is \\(k (x - x) = 0\\), which is always zero.\n\n3. For the dashpot: \\(c \\frac{d x}{d t} = F(t)\\), where \\(x\\) is the position of the dashpot's end attached to the mass.\n\nSince the spring's equation is always zero, we can ignore it. The mass and dashpot are connected in series, so the force applied to the mass is equal to the force applied to the dashpot. Therefore, we can write:\n\n\\[m \\frac{d^2 x}{d t^2} = c \\frac{d x}{d t} + F(t)\\]\n\nStep 3: Apply the unit step force\nThe unit step force is given by \\(F(t) = u_{S}(t)\\). Therefore, the differential equation becomes:\n\n\\[m \\frac{d^2 x}{d t^2} = c \\frac{d x}{d t} + u_{S}(t)\\]\n\nStep 4: Solve the differential equation\nTo solve this differential equation, we can use the Laplace transform method. Let's take the Laplace transform of both sides:\n\n\\[m s^2 X(s) - m x(0) - m x'(0) = c s X(s) - c x(0) + \\frac{1}{s}\\]\n\nSince the initial position and velocity are zero, we have:\n\n\\[m s^2 X(s) = c s X(s) + \\frac{1}{s}\\]\n\nStep 5: Solve for X(s)\nRearranging the equation, we get:\n\n\\[(m s^2 - c s) X(s) = \\frac{1}{s}\\]\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[X(s) = \\frac{1}{s (m s^2 - c s)} = \\frac{1}{s (m s - c) s}\\]\n\nStep 6: Partial fraction decomposition\nWe can decompose the fraction into partial fractions:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{s (m s - c) s} = \\frac{A}{s} + \\frac{B}{m s - c}\\]\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[1 = A (m s - c) s + B s\\]\n\nEquating coefficients, we get:\n\n\\[A (m s - c) s = 1\\]\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[A = \\frac{1}{(m s - c) s}\\]\n\nSimilarly:\n\n\\[B s = 1\\]\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[B = \\frac{1}{s}\\]\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[X(s) = \\frac{1}{s (m s -

  "Problem: Preamble: Consider the mass \\(m\\) sliding horizontally under the influence of the applied force \\(f\\) and a friction force which can be approximated by a linear friction element with coefficient \\(b\\). \n\nFormulate the state-determined equation of motion for the velocity \\(v\\) as output and the force \\(f\\) as input.\n\nStep 1: Identify the system's variables and parameters.\n- Variables: velocity \\(v\\), force \\(f\\)\n- Parameters: mass \\(m\\), friction coefficient \\(b\\)\n\nStep 2: Recall Newton's second law of motion, which relates the net force acting on an object to its mass and acceleration. The equation is \\(F_{net} = m \\cdot a\\), where \\(F_{net}\\) is the net force, \\(m\\) is the mass, and \\(a\\) is the acceleration.\n\nStep 3: Since the mass is sliding horizontally, the acceleration is in the same direction as the velocity. Therefore, the acceleration \\(a\\) is the derivative of velocity \\(v\\) with respect to time, i.e., \\(a = \\frac{dv}{dt}\\).\n\nStep 4: The net force \\(F_{net}\\) is the sum of the applied force \\(f\\) and the friction force. The friction force can be modeled as a linear element with coefficient \\(b\\), so the friction force is \\(b \\cdot v\\).

  "Step 1:  The problem requires finding the inverse Laplace transform of the given frequency-domain expression $F(s) = -\\frac{(4 s-10)}{s(s+2)(s+5)}$. To solve this, we can use partial fraction decomposition to break down the expression into simpler terms, which can then be transformed back into the time domain using the inverse Laplace transform.\n\nStep 2:  First, let's express the given function as a partial fraction decomposition. We can write $F(s)$ as:\n\n$$F(s) = -\\frac{(4 s-10)}{s(s+2)(s+5)} = -\\frac{A}{s} - \\frac{B}{s+2} - \\frac{C}{s+5}$$\n\nwhere A, B, and C are constants to be determined.\n\nStep 3:  To find the values of A, B, and C, we multiply both sides by the denominator s(s+2)(s+5) to clear the fractions:\n\n$$-(4 s-10) = A(s+2)(s+5) + B s(s+5) + C s(s+2)$$\n\nStep 4:  Now, we can solve for A, B, and C by choosing suitable values of s that will make some terms disappear. Let's start by setting s = 0:\n\n$$-(-10) = A(2)(5) \\Rightarrow 10 = 10A \\Rightarrow A = 1$$\n\nStep 5:  Next, let's set s = -2:\n\n$$-(-2 -10) = B(-2)(-2+5) \\Rightarrow 12 = 6B \\Rightarrow B = 2$$\n\nStep 6:  Finally, let's set s = -5:\n\n$$-(-5 -10) = C(-5)(-5+2) \\Rightarrow 15 = 15C \\Rightarrow C = 1$$\n\nStep 7:  Therefore, the partial fraction decomposition is:\n\n$$F(s) = -\\frac{1}{s} - \\frac{2}{s+2} - \\frac{1}{s+5}$$\n\nStep 8:  Now, we can apply the inverse Laplace transform to each term:\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{-\\frac{1}{s}\\right\\} = -u(t)$$\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{-\\frac{2}{s+2}\\right\\} = -2e^{-2t}u(t)$$\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{-\\frac{1}{s+5}\\right\\} = -e^{-5t}u(t)$$\n\nStep 9:  Therefore, the inverse Laplace transform of F(s) is:\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{F(s)\\right\\} = -u(t) - 2e^{-2t}u(t) - e^{-5t}u(t)$$\n\nStep 10:  So, the final answer is \\boxed{-u(t) - 2e^{-2t}u(t) - e^{-5t}u(t)}",
  "Step 1: The given Laplace transform is \\(X(s) = b + \\frac{a}{s(s+a)}\\), where \\(a, b > 0\\), and the region of convergence is \\(|s| > 0\\). We need to find the inverse Laplace transform \\(x(t)\\) for \\(t > 0\\).\n\nStep 2: The Laplace transform \\(X(s)\\) can be decomposed into two parts: the first part is \\(b\\), which is a constant, and the second part is \\(\\frac{a}{s(s+a)}\\). We can use partial fraction decomposition to simplify the second part.\n\nStep 3: To decompose \\(\\frac{a}{s(s+a)}\\) into partial fractions, we write it as \\(\\frac{A}{s} + \\frac{B}{s+a}\\). Then, we equate the numerator: \\(a = A(s+a) + Bs\\). Solving for A and B, we get \\(A = \\frac{a}{a} = 1\\) and \\(B = -\\frac{a}{a} = -1\\). Therefore, \\(\\frac{a}{s(s+a)} = \\frac{1}{s} - \\frac{1}{s+a}\\).\n\nStep 4: Now, we can rewrite the original Laplace transform as \\(X(s) = b + \\frac{1}{s} - \\frac{1}{s+a}\\). The inverse Laplace transform of each term is as follows:\n\n- The inverse Laplace transform of \\(b\\) is \\(b\\delta(t)\\), where \\(\\delta(t)\\) is the Dirac delta function.\n- The inverse Laplace transform of \\(\\frac{1}{s}\\) is 1.\n- The inverse Laplace transform of \\(\\frac{1}{s+a}\\) is \\(e^{-at}u(t)\\), where \\(u(t)\\) is the unit step function.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, the inverse Laplace transform of \\(X(s)\\) is \\(x(t) = b\\delta(t) + 1 - e^{-at}u(t)\\). Since the problem specifies \\(t > 0\\), we can ignore the Dirac delta function because it is only non-zero at \\(t = 0\\). Therefore, \\(x(t) = 1 - e^{-at}u(t)\\) for \\(t > 0\\).\n\nStep 6: Since \\(u(t)\\) is 1 for \\(t > 0\\) and 0 otherwise, we can simplify the expression to \\(x(t) = 1 - e^{-at}\\) for \\(t > 0\\).\n\nStep 7: Therefore, the inverse Laplace transform \\(x(t)\\) is \\(1 - e^{-at}\\) for \\(t > 0\\).\n\nStep 8: So, the final answer is \\boxed{1 - e^{-at}}",
  "Step 1: The given Laplace Transform is \\(Y(s) = \\frac{1}{(s+a)(s+b)}\\).

In this case, the denominator is \\((s+a)(s+b)\\), which can be factored into two linear terms. Therefore, we can express \\(Y(s)\\) as partial fractions.\n\nStep 3: Let's express \\(Y(s)\\) as partial fractions:\n\n\\[\nY(s) = \\frac{1}{(s+a)(s+b)} = \\frac{A}{s+a} + \\frac{B}{s+b}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are constants to be determined.\n\nStep 4: To find \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), we multiply both sides by \\((s+a)(s+b)\\):\n\n\\[\n1 = A(s+b) + B(s+a)\n\\]\n\nStep 5: Let's choose suitable values for \\(s\\) to solve for \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).

\\frac{B}{s+b}\n\\]\n\nSince the original expression is \\(\\frac{1}{(s+a)(s+b)}\\), the signs of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) should be such that when multiplied by \\((s+a)(s+b)\\), the result is 1.\n\nStep

  "Step 1:  The problem requires finding the inverse Laplace transform of the given frequency-domain expression $F(s) = \\frac{4}{s^2(s^2+4)}$. To solve this, we can use partial fraction decomposition to break down the expression into simpler terms that can be easily inverted.\n\nStep 2:  First, we need to decompose the given expression into partial fractions. The denominator can be factored as $s^2(s^2+4) = s^2(s^2+2^2) = s^2(s+2i)(s-2i)$. Therefore, we can write $F(s)$ as:\n\n$$F(s) = \\frac{4}{s^2(s^2+4)} = \\frac{A}{s} + \\frac{B}{s^2} + \\frac{Cs+D}{s^2+4}$$\n\nwhere $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ are constants to be determined.\n\nStep 3:  To find these constants, we multiply both sides by the denominator $s^2(s^2+4)$ to clear the fractions. This gives us:\n\n$$4 = A(s^2+4) + Bs(s^2+4) + (Cs+D)s^2$$\n\nStep 4:  Now, we can equate coefficients of like powers of $s$ on both sides. Setting $s=0$ gives $4 = A(4)$, so $A = 1$. Setting $s=0$ again gives $0 = B(4)$, so $B = 0$. Setting $s=2i$ gives $4 = (2i)^2(1+2i) + (2i)(1+2i)(2i) + (2i)(1+2i)(2i)^2$, which simplifies to $4 = -4 - 4i + 4i - 8 = -8$. Therefore, $C = -1$. Setting $s=-2i$ gives $4 = (-2i)^2(1-2i) + (-2i)(1-2i)(-2i) + (-2i)(1-2i)(-2i)^2$, which simplifies to $4 = -4 + 4i - 4i + 8 = 4$. Therefore, $D = 1$.\n\nStep 5:  Therefore, the partial fraction decomposition is:\n\n$$F(s) = \\frac{1}{s} - \\frac{1}{s^2} - \\frac{s-1}{s^2+4}$$\n\nStep 6:  Now, we can take the inverse Laplace transform of each term. The inverse Laplace transform of $\\frac{1}{s}$ is $1$. The inverse Laplace transform of $\\frac{1}{s^2}$ is $t$. The inverse Laplace transform of $\\frac{s-1}{s^2+4}$ is $\\frac{1}{2}e^{-2t}\\sin(2t)$. Therefore, the inverse Laplace transform of $F(s)$ is:\n\n$$f(t) = 1 - t - \\frac{1}{2}e^{-2t}\\sin(2t)$$\n\nStep 7:  Therefore, the inverse Laplace transform of $F(s) = \\frac{4}{s^2(s^2+4)}$ is $f(t) = 1 - t - \\frac{1}{2}e^{-2t}\\sin(2t)$.\n\nStep 8:  Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{1 - t - \\frac{1}{2}e^{-2t}\\sin(2t)}",

  "Step 1: Understand the circuit components and their connections.\nThe circuit consists of a voltage source \\( v_{i}(t) \\) connected in series with an inductor \\( L \\) and a capacitor \\( C \\). The output is the voltage across the capacitor, denoted as \\( v_{o}(t) \\). Both voltages share the same ground reference.\n\nStep 2: Recall the basic equations for inductors and capacitors in a circuit.\nFor an inductor, the voltage across it is given by \\( v_{L} = L \\frac{di_{L}}{dt} \\), where \\( i_{L} \\) is the current through the inductor. For a capacitor, the current through it is given by \\( i_{C} = C \\frac{dv_{C}}{dt} \\), where \\( v_{C} \\) is the voltage across the capacitor.\n\nStep 3: Apply Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) to the circuit.\nKVL states that the sum of all voltage changes around a closed loop in a circuit is zero. In this case, the loop is from the voltage source, through the inductor, through the capacitor, and back to the source. Therefore, the sum of the voltage across the inductor, the voltage across the capacitor, and the voltage source must be zero.\n\nStep 4: Write the differential equation based on KVL.\nLet \\( i_{L} \\) be the current through the inductor and capacitor. Then, the voltage across the inductor is \\( v_{L} = L \\frac{di_{L}}{dt} \\), and the voltage across the capacitor is \\( v_{C} = v_{o}(t) \\). The voltage source is \\( v_{i}(t) \\). Therefore, applying KVL:\n\n\\[ v_{i}(t) - L \\frac{di_{L}}{dt} - v_{o}(t) = 0 \\]\n\nStep 5: Express the current through the capacitor in terms of the output voltage.\nSince the capacitor is in series with the inductor, the current through both components is the same. Therefore, \\( i_{L} = i_{C} = i \\). The voltage across the capacitor is \\( v_{C} = v_{o}(t) = iC \\). Therefore, \\( i = \\frac{v_{o}(t)}{C} \\).\n\nStep 6: Substitute the expression for current into the differential equation.\nSubstituting \\( i = \\frac{v_{o}(t)}{C} \\) into the differential equation:\n\n\\[ v_{i}(t) - L \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{v_{o}(t)}{C}\\right) - v_{o}(t) = 0 \\]\n\nStep 7: Simplify the differential equation.\nDifferentiating \\( \\frac{v_{o}(t)}{C} \\) with respect to time:\n\n\\[ \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{v_{o}(t)}{C}\\right) = \\frac{1}{C}\\frac{dv_{o}(t)}{dt} \\]\n\nTherefore, the differential equation becomes:\n\n\\[ v_{i}(t) - L \\frac{1}{C}\\frac{dv_{o}(t)}{dt} - v_{o}(t) = 0 \\]\n\nStep 8: Rearrange the differential equation to standard form.\nRearranging the terms:\n\n\\[ \\frac{dv_{o}(t)}{dt} + \\frac{1}{LC}v_{o}(t) = \\frac{1}{L}v_{i}(t) \\]\n\nTherefore, the governing differential equation for the circuit is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{dv_{o}(t)}{dt} + \\frac{1}{LC}v_{o}(t) = \\frac{1}{L}v_{i}(t) \\]\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{\\frac{dv_{o}(t)}{dt} + \\frac{1}{LC}v_{o}(t) = \\frac{1}{L}v_{i}(t)}",
  "Step 1: To write the equation of motion for a pendulum consisting of a mass m attached to a rigid massless rod, suspended from the ceiling and free to rotate in a single vertical plane, we need to consider the forces acting on the system and apply Newton's second law.\n\nStep 2: The forces acting on the pendulum are:\n\n- The weight of the mass m, which is mg acting downward.\n- The tension in the rod, which is a force directed along the rod. Since the rod is massless, the tension is the only force along the rod.\n- The external horizontal force f(t) applied to the mass.\n\nStep 3: We can resolve the forces into components along the rod and perpendicular to the rod. However, since the rod is massless, the tension is the only force along the rod. Therefore, the component of the tension along the rod is T cos(\u03b8), where T is the magnitude of the tension. The component perpendicular to the rod is T sin(\u03b8).\n\nStep 4: The weight mg acts downward, which is perpendicular to the rod. Therefore, the component of the weight along the rod is 0, and the component perpendicular to the rod is mg.\n\nStep 5: The external force f(t) is applied horizontally, so its component along the rod is f(t) cos(\u03b8), and its component perpendicular to the rod is f(t) sin(\u03b8).\n\nStep 6: The acceleration of the mass m is the second derivative of its position with respect to time. Since the position of the mass is given by the angle \u03b8, the acceleration is the second derivative of \u03b8 with respect to time, which is \u03b8''.\n\nStep 7: Applying Newton's second law, the sum of the forces along the rod is equal to the mass times the acceleration along the rod. Therefore, we have:\n\nT cos(\u03b8) - f(t) cos(\u03b8) = m * \u03b8''.\n\nStep 8: Similarly, the sum of the forces perpendicular to the rod is equal to the mass times the acceleration perpendicular to the rod. Therefore, we have:\n\nT sin(\u03b8) + mg - f(t) sin(\u03b8) = 0.\n\nStep 9: However, since the pendulum is free to rotate in a single vertical plane, the motion is constrained to the plane. Therefore, the acceleration perpendicular to the rod is zero. Therefore, the equation T sin(\u03b8) + mg - f(t) sin(\u03b8) = 0 is not valid.\n\nStep 10: Therefore, we only have the equation along the rod:\n\nT cos(\u03b8) - f(t) cos(\u03b8) = m * \u03b8''.\n\nStep 11: However, the tension T is not known. To find T, we need to consider the forces acting on the rod. Since the rod is massless, the only force acting on the rod is the tension at the top and the tension at the bottom. However, since the rod is attached to the ceiling, the tension at the top is zero. Therefore, the tension at the bottom is equal to the weight of the mass m plus the external force f(t). Therefore, T = mg + f(t).\n\nStep 12: Substituting T = mg + f(t) into the equation along the rod, we get:\n\n(mg + f(t)) cos(\u03b8) - f(t) cos(\u03b8) = m * \u03b8''.\n\nStep 13: Simplifying the equation, we get:\n\nmg cos(\u03b8) = m * \u03b8''.\n\nStep 14: Dividing both sides by m, we get:\n\ng cos(\u03b8) = \u03b8''.\n\nStep 15: Therefore, the equation of motion for the pendulum is:\n\n\u03b8'' + g cos(\u03b8) = 0.\n\nStep 16: Therefore, the equation of motion for the pendulum is \u03b8'' + g cos(\u03b8) = 0.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{\u03b8'' + g cos(\u03b8) = 0}",

Significant figures are the digits in a number that are known to be reliable and certain.

The number 299,792,458 has 9 digits, so rounding it to 1 significant figure would involve rounding to the nearest power of 10, which is 10^8.\n\nStep 4: To convert 299,792,458 to the format a \u00d7 10^b, we need to find the coefficient a and the exponent b. The coefficient a is the number before the exponent, and the exponent b is the power of 10.\n\nStep 5: To find the coefficient a, we divide the original number by 10^b.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of special relativity and how it applies to Manny's situation. Since Manny is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, we must use relativistic kinematics to determine his speed.\nStep 2:  First, let's recall that in special relativity, the Lorentz transformation relates the coordinates of an event in one inertial frame to those in another. Here, we have two inertial frames: Manny's frame (moving at speed $\\beta$) and the stationary frame (at home plate).\nStep 3:  Manny sees third base at an angle of $45^{\\circ}$ to his left. This means that in his moving frame, the angle between his direction of motion and the direction to third base is $45^{\\circ}$. We need to find the speed $\\beta$ at which this is true.\nStep 4:  Let's denote the speed of light as $c$. In the stationary frame, the distance from home plate to third base is $d$. In Manny's moving frame, the distance to third base is $d/\\gamma$, where $\\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1-\\beta^2}$ is the Lorentz factor.\nStep 5:  Since Manny sees third base at an angle of $45^{\\circ}$ to his left, the distance to third base in his frame is $d/\\gamma$. The angle between his direction of motion and the direction to third base is $45^{\\circ}$, so the distance to third base is $d/\\gamma = d\\sin(45^{\\circ}) = d/\\sqrt{2}$.\nStep 6:  Equating this to $d/\\gamma$, we get $d/\\gamma = d/\\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, $\\gamma = \\sqrt{2}$.\nStep 7:  From the definition of $\\gamma$, we have $\\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1-\\beta^2} = \\sqrt{2}$. Squaring both sides, we get $1/(1-\\beta^2) = 2$. Solving for $\\beta^2$, we have $1-\\beta^2 = 1/2$, so $\\beta^2 = 1/2$.

  "Step 1: Problem Explanation\nThe problem involves calculating the energy of the neutrino in the rest frame of the deuteron, given that the two protons have the same energy \u03b3m_p and impact angle \u03b8, and the electron is at rest in the lab frame. We need to make the approximations that the deuteron rest mass is 2m_p, and that the electron and neutrino have negligible rest mass compared to the proton rest mass m_p.\n\nStep 2: \nTo solve this problem, we need to use the principles of special relativity and the concept of four-momentum. We will first calculate the four-momentum of the initial state (two protons and an electron) in the lab frame, then boost to the deuteron rest frame, and finally calculate the energy of the neutrino in that frame.\n\nStep 3: \nFirst, let's calculate the four-momentum of the initial state in the lab frame. The two protons have the same energy \u03b3m_p and impact angle \u03b8, so their four-momenta are:\n\np1 = \u03b3m_p (cosh(\u03b8), sinh(\u03b8), 0, 0)\np2 = \u03b3m_p (cosh(\u03b8), -sinh(\u03b8), 0, 0)\n\nThe electron is at rest, so its four-momentum is:\n\np_e = m_e (1, 0, 0, 0)\n\nSince m_e is negligible, we can set p_e = 0.\n\nThe total four-momentum of the initial state is:\n\nP = p1 + p2 + p_e = 2\u03b3m_p (cosh(\u03b8), sinh(\u03b8), 0, 0)\n\nStep 4: \nNext, we need to boost this four-momentum to the deuteron rest frame. The deuteron has rest mass 2m_p, so its four-momentum is:\n\nP_d = 2m_p (1, 0, 0, 0)\n\nWe can use the Lorentz transformation to boost P to the deuteron rest frame:\n\nP' = \u03b3_d (P - \u03b2_d P^0)\n\nwhere \u03b2_d is the velocity of the deuteron in the lab frame, and \u03b3_d is the Lorentz factor.\n\nFirst, we need to find \u03b2_d. Since the deuteron is at rest in its own frame, its four-momentum is P_d = 2m_p (1, 0, 0, 0). The lab frame is moving with velocity \u03b2_d relative to the deuteron frame. Therefore, the four-momentum of the lab frame is:\n\nP_lab = \u03b3_d (P_d + \u03b2_d P_d^0)\n\nSince P_d^0 = 2m_p, we have:\n\nP_lab = \u03b3_d (2m_p + \u03b2_d 2m_p) = 2\u03b3_d m_p (1 + \u03b2_d)\n\nTherefore, \u03b2_d = (P_lab^0 - 2m_p) / (2m_p) = (2\u03b3_d m_p - 2m_p) / (2m_p) = \u03b3_d - 1\n\nNow, we can calculate \u03b3_d:\n\n\u03b3_d = 1 / sqrt(1 - \u03b2_d^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (\u03b3_d - 1)^2)\n\nSolving for \u03b3_d, we get:\n\n\u03b3_d = 1 / sqrt(1 - (\u03b3_d - 1)^2) => (\u03b3_d - 1)^2 = 1 - 1/\u03b3_d^2 => \u03b3_d^4 - 2\u03b3_d^3 + 2\u03b3_d^2 - 1 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in \u03b3_d^2:\n\n(\u03b3_d^2)^2 - 2(\u03b3_d^2) + 1 = 0 => (\u03b3_d^2 - 1)^2 = 0 => \u03b3_d^2 = 1 => \u03b3_d = 1\n\nTherefore, \u03b2_d = \u03b3_d - 1 = 0, which means the lab frame is at rest relative to the deuteron frame. Therefore, the four-momentum of the initial state in the deuteron rest frame is the same as in the lab frame:\n\nP' = P = 2\u03b3m_p (cosh(\u03b8), sinh(\u03b8), 0, 0)\n\nStep 5: \nNow, we need to calculate the four-momentum of the final state (deuteron and neutrino) in the deuteron rest frame. The deuteron has rest mass 2m_p, so its four-momentum is:\n\nP_d = 2m_p (1, 0, 0, 0)\n\nThe neutrino has energy E_\u03bd and momentum p_\u03bd in the deuteron rest frame. Therefore, the four-momentum of the neutrino is:\n\nP_\u03bd = (E_\u03bd, p_\u03bd, 0, 0)\n\nThe total four-momentum of the final state is:\n\nP' = P_d + P_\u03bd = 2m_p + (E_\u03bd, p_\u03bd, 0, 0)\n\nSince the initial and final states have the same total four-momentum, we can equate them:\n\nP' = P => 2m_p + (E_\u03bd, p_\u03bd, 0, 0) = 2\u03b3m_p (cosh(\u03b8), sinh(\u03b8), 0, 0)\n\nEquating the spatial components, we get:\n\np_\u03bd = 2\u03b3m_p sinh(\u03b8)\n\nEquating the time components, we get:\n\nE_\u03bd + 2m_p = 2\u03b3m_p cosh(\u03b8)\n\nTherefore, the energy of the neutrino in the deuteron rest frame is:\n\nE_\u03bd = 2\u03b3m_p cosh(\u03b8) - 2m_p\n\nStep 6: \nNow, we need to express E_\u03bd in terms of \u03b8, m_p, and \u03b3. We can rewrite cosh(\u03b8) as:\n\ncosh(\u03b8) = 1 / sqrt(1 - tanh^2(\u03b8)) = 1 / sqrt(1 - sinh^2(\u03b8) / cosh^2(\u03b8)) = 1 / sqrt(1 - sinh^2(\u03b8) / (1 + sinh^2(\u03b8)) = 1 / sqrt(1 - sinh^2(\u03b8) / (1 + sinh^2(\u03b8)) = 1 / sqrt(1 -

  "The age of the universe when most He nuclei were formed is approximately 3 minutes. Therefore, the age of the universe when hydrogen atoms formed is approximately 3 minutes - 3 minutes = 0 minutes. However, since the age of the universe is typically measured in years, we need to convert 0 minutes to years. There are 60 minutes in an hour, 24 hours in a day, 365.25 days in a year, so there are 60 * 24 * 365.25 = 525,600 minutes in a year. Therefore, 0 minutes is 0 / 525,600 = 0 years.

  "Problem: Determine the wavelength of radiation emitted by hydrogen atoms in angstroms upon electron transitions from n=6 to n=2.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to use the Rydberg formula, which relates the energy of the electron transitions in a hydrogen atom to the wavelength of the emitted radiation. The Rydberg formula is given by:\n\n1/\u03bb = R \\* (1/n_f^2 - 1/n_i^2)\n\nwhere \u03bb is the wavelength of the radiation, R is the Rydberg constant (approximately 1.097 x 10^7 m^-1), n_f is the final energy level (in this case, n=2), and n_i is the initial energy level (in this case, n=6).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the Rydberg constant from m^-1 to \u00c5^-1. Since 1 \u00c5 = 10^-10 m, we can convert R as follows:\n\nR (\u00c5^-1) = R (m^-1) \\* (10^-10 m / 1 \u00c5) = 1.097 x 10^7 m^-1 \\* 10^-10 m/\u00c5 = 1.097 x 10^-3 \u00c5^-1\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the Rydberg formula:\n\n1/\u03bb = 1.097 x 10^-3 \u00c5^-1 \\* (1/2^2 - 1/6^2)\n\nFirst, calculate the terms inside the parentheses:\n\n1/2^2 = 1/4 = 0.25\n\n1/6^2 = 1/36 = 0.02777777777777778\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n1/\u03bb = 1.097 x 10^-3 \u00c5^-1 \\* (0.25 - 0.02777777777777778)\n\nFirst, subtract the terms inside the parentheses:\n\n0.25 - 0.02777777777777778 = 0.22222222222222222\n\nNow, multiply by the Rydberg constant:\n\n1/\u03bb = 1.097 x 10^-3 \u00c5^-1 \\* 0.22222222222222222\n\nPerform the multiplication:\n\n1/\u03bb = 0.00024333333333333333 \u00c5^-1\n\nNow, take the reciprocal to find \u03bb:\n\n\u03bb = 1 / 0.00024333333333333333 \u00c5^-1\n\nPerform the division:\n\n\u03bb = 4111.111111111111 \u00c5\n\nSo, the wavelength of radiation emitted by hydrogen atoms in angstroms upon electron transitions from n=6 to n=2 is approximately 4111.11 \u00c5.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{4111.11}",

  "Step 1: First, we need to recall the formula that relates the wavelength of light to its frequency. The formula is given by the speed of light equation: c = \u03bbv, where c is the speed of light (approximately 3.00 \u00d7 10^8 m/s), \u03bb is the wavelength, and v is the frequency.\n\nStep 2: We are given the wavelength \u03bb = 6.7102 \u00d7 10^-5 cm. First, we need to convert this wavelength from centimeters to meters because the speed of light is given in meters per second. To convert from centimeters to meters, we divide by 100 since 1 m = 100 cm.\n\nStep 3: Convert \u03bb from cm to m: \u03bb = 6.7102 \u00d7 10^-5 cm / 100 = 6.7102 \u00d7 10^-7 m.\n\nStep 4: Now, we can use the formula c = \u03bbv to solve for v. Rearranging the formula to solve for v gives us v = c / \u03bb.\n\nStep 5: Plug in the values: c = 3.00 \u00d7 10^8 m/s and \u03bb = 6.7102 \u00d7 10^-7 m.\n\nStep 6: Calculate v: v = (3.00 \u00d7 10^8 m/s) / (6.7102 \u00d7 10^-7 m) = (3.00 \u00d7 10^8) / (6.7102 \u00d7 10^-7) = 4.476 \u00d7 10^14 Hz.\n\nStep 7: The problem asks for the frequency to 4 decimal places. Therefore, we need to round the calculated frequency to 4 decimal places.\n\nStep 8: Rounding 4.476 \u00d7 10^14 to 4 decimal places gives us 4.4760 \u00d7 10^14 Hz.\n\nStep 9: Therefore, the frequency v is 4.4760 \u00d7 10^14 Hz.\n\nStep 10: The final answer is \\boxed{4.4760 \u00d7 10^14}",
  "Step 1: First, let's recall the formula that relates the energy of a photon to its frequency and wavelength. The energy of a photon is given by E = hf, where h is Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 J s) and f is the frequency of the radiation. The wavelength of the photon can be found using the formula \u03bb = c / f, where c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nStep 2: The problem states that the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation is 3.091 x 10^14 Hz. We need to calculate the wavelength of the photoemission generated by this interaction. To do this, we can use the formula \u03bb = c / f.\n\nStep 3: First, let's calculate the wavelength using the given frequency. The speed of light is approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s. So, the wavelength would be \u03bb = (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (3.091 x 10^14 Hz).\n\nStep 4: To perform this calculation, we need to divide the speed of light by the frequency. This can be done by dividing the numerator (3 x 10^8) by the denominator (3.091 x 10^14). We can simplify this by dividing the coefficients (3/3.091) and subtracting the exponents (8 - 14).\n\nStep 5: First, let's calculate the coefficient: 3/3.091 \u2248 0.971. Then, subtract the exponents: 8 - 14 = -6. So, the wavelength would be approximately 0.971 x 10^(-6) m.\n\nStep 6: However, the problem asks for the answer in the format n x 10^x, where n is to 2 decimal places. Therefore, we need to express 0.971 x 10^(-6) in this format.\n\nStep 7: Since 0.971 is already less than 1, we can write it as 0.97 x 10^(-6) m.\n\nStep 8: Therefore, the wavelength of photoemission generated by this interaction is approximately 0.97 x 10^(-6) m.\n\nStep 9: So, the final answer is \\boxed{0.97 x 10^(-6)}",
  "Step 1: To find the energy gap between the electronic states n=3 and n=8 in a hydrogen atom, we need to calculate the energy of each state and then subtract the lower energy from the higher energy.\n\nStep 2: The energy of an electron in a hydrogen atom can be calculated using the formula E_n = -13.6 eV / n^2, where n is the principal quantum number.\n\nStep 3: First, let's calculate the energy of the state n=3. Plugging n=3 into the formula, we get E_3 = -13.6 eV / 3^2 = -13.6 eV / 9 = -1.5111 eV (keeping more decimal places for intermediate calculations).\n\nStep 4: Next, let's calculate the energy of the state n=8. Plugging n=8 into the formula, we get E_8 = -13.6 eV / 8^2 = -13.6 eV / 64 = -0.2125 eV.\n\nStep 5: Now, to find the energy gap, we subtract the energy of the lower state (n=3) from the energy of the higher state (n=8). So, the energy gap is E_8 - E_3 = -0.2125 eV - (-1.5111 eV) = -0.2125 eV + 1.5111 eV = 1.2986 eV.\n\nStep 6: The problem asks for the energy gap to 1 decimal place. Therefore, rounding 1.2986 eV to 1 decimal place gives 1.3 eV.\n\nStep 7: Therefore, the energy gap between the electronic states n=3 and n=8 in a hydrogen atom is 1.3 eV.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{1.3}",

However, in the context of the Bohr model, the energy is negative, but the velocity is real. The Bohr model assumes that the electron is in a stable orbit, so the velocity is real.\n\nTo find the real velocity, we need to take the absolute value of the square root:\n\n\\[ v = \\sqrt{|-2.972 \\times 10^{12}|} \\]\n\n\\[ v = \\sqrt{2.972 \\times 10^{12}} \\]\n\n\\[ v = 1.72 \\times 10^6 \\text{ m/s} \\]\n\nStep 5: Format the answer as n \u00d7 10^x\nThe problem asks to format the answer as n \u00d7 10^x where n is to 2 decimal places.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n\\[ v = 1.72 \\times 10^6 \\text{ m/s} \\]\n\nTherefore, n = 1.72 and x = 6.\n\nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{1.72 \u00d7 10^6}",
  "Step 1: Determine the type of material based on its color in transmitted light.\nThe material appears red in transmitted light. This indicates that it absorbs light in the blue and violet parts of the visible spectrum, allowing red light to pass through. This behavior is characteristic of semiconductors, which have a band gap that is roughly equal to the energy of visible light. Conductors would not absorb visible light, and insulators would absorb all visible light.\n\nStep 2: Estimate the band gap based on the color.\nThe color red corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 620-750 nanometers (nm). The energy of a photon is given by E = hc/\u03bb, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and \u03bb is the wavelength. We can use this formula to estimate the band gap.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the energy corresponding to the red wavelength.\nFirst, we need to convert the wavelength from nm to meters: 620 nm = 620 \u00d7 10^(-9) m. Then, we can calculate the energy:\n\nE = hc/\u03bb = (6.626 \u00d7 10^(-34) J s) \u00d7 (3 \u00d7 10^8 m/s) / (620 \u00d7 10^(-9) m) \u2248 3.18 \u00d7 10^(-19) J\n\nTo convert this energy from joules to electronvolts (eV), we divide by the elementary charge (1.602 \u00d7 10^(-19) C):\n\nE \u2248 3.18 \u00d7 10^(-19) J / (1.602 \u00d7 10^(-19) C) \u2248 1.98 eV\n\nHowever, this is the energy of a photon with wavelength 620 nm. The band gap is typically slightly higher than this energy, as the material needs to absorb photons with energies above the band gap to excite charge carriers. Therefore, we can estimate the band gap to be around 2 eV.\n\nStep 4: Round the estimated band gap to 1 decimal place.\nThe estimated band gap is approximately 2 eV. Rounding to 1 decimal place gives 2.0 eV.\n\nTherefore, the approximate band gap for this material is 2.0 eV.\n\nFinal answer: The final answer is \\boxed{2.0}",
  "Problem: Calculate the minimum potential (V) in volts (to 1 decimal place) which must be applied to a free electron so that it has enough energy to excite, upon impact, the electron in a hydrogen atom from its ground state to a state of n=5. Step 1: First, let's recall the energy levels of a hydrogen atom. The energy of the nth state is given by the formula E_n = -13.6 / n^2 eV, where n is the principal quantum number. The ground state is n=1, and the energy is E_1 = -13.6 eV. The energy of the state n=5 is E_5 = -13.6 / 5^2 = -13.6 / 25 = -0.544 eV. Therefore, the energy difference between the ground state and the n=5 state is \u0394E = E_5 - E_1 = -0.544 - (-13.6) = 13.056 eV. Step 2: The energy of the free electron is given by the equation E = eV, where e is the elementary charge (approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 C) and V is the potential in volts. Therefore, the minimum potential V required to give the electron enough energy to excite the hydrogen atom is V = \u0394E / e. Step 3: Now, let's calculate the minimum potential V. First, convert the energy difference \u0394E from eV to Joules: \u0394E = 13.056 eV * 1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV = 20.9 x 10^-19 J. Then, V = \u0394E / e = (20.9 x 10^-19 J) / (1.602 x 10^-19 C) = 13.056 V. Step 4: Since the problem asks for the answer to 1 decimal place, round the result to 1 decimal place. Therefore, the minimum potential V is 13.1 V. Step 5: Therefore, the minimum potential V in volts (to 1 decimal place) which must be applied to a free electron so that it has enough energy to excite, upon impact, the electron in a hydrogen atom from its ground state to a state of n=5 is 13.1 V. So the final answer is \\boxed{13.1}",

Therefore, we need to convert the ionization potential from eV to J.\n\nStep 3: The conversion factor from eV to J is 1 eV = 1.6 \u00d7 10^(-19) J. Therefore, we can convert the ionization potential for Mg from eV to J by multiplying by 1.6 \u00d7 10^(-19) J/eV.\n\nStep 4: Multiply 7.64 eV by 1.6 \u00d7 10^(-19) J/eV to get the first ionization energy in J.\n\nStep 5: Perform the calculation: 7.64 eV \u00d7 1.6 \u00d7 10^(-19) J/eV = 1.22864 \u00d7 10^(-18) J.\n\nStep 6: Round the result to 2 decimal places: 1.23 \u00d7 10^(-18) J.\n\nTherefore, the first ionization energy for Mg is 1.23 \u00d7 10^(-18) J.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{1.23 \u00d7 10^(-18)}",
  "Step 1: First, let's understand the problem. We have light with a wavelength of 4.28 \u00d7 10^-7 m interacting with a hydrogen atom. The light transfers all its energy to the orbiting electron, and we need to find the velocity of this electron after the interaction.\n\nStep 2: To solve this, we need to calculate the energy of the photon (light) first. The energy of a photon is given by E = hc / \u03bb, where h is Planck's constant (6.626 \u00d7 10^-34 J s), c is the speed of light (3 \u00d7 10^8 m/s), and \u03bb is the wavelength of the light.\n\nStep 3: Plug in the values to calculate the energy of the photon: E = (6.626 \u00d7 10^-34 J s) \u00d7 (3 \u00d7 10^8 m/s) / (4.28 \u00d7 10^-7 m).\n\nStep 4: Perform the calculation: E = (6.626 \u00d7 10^-34) \u00d7 (3 \u00d7 10^8) / (4.28 \u00d7 10^-7) = (6.626 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 10^(-34 + 8 - (-7))) = (6.626 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 10^3) / 4.28 = 19.878 / 4.28 = 4.65 \u00d7 10^-1 J.\n\nStep 5: Convert the energy from Joules to electronvolts (eV) because the energy levels in hydrogen are typically expressed in eV. 1 eV = 1.602 \u00d7 10^-19 J. So, E = 4.65 \u00d7 10^-1 J / (1.602 \u00d7 10^-19 J/eV) = 4.65 \u00d7 10^-1 / 1.602 \u00d7 10^-19 = 2.90 \u00d7 10^18 eV.\n\nStep 6: The energy levels in hydrogen are given by the formula E_n = -13.6 eV / n^2, where n is the principal quantum number. Since the electron is in the ground state (n=1), the energy is E_1 = -13.6 eV. The energy transferred to the electron is 2.90 \u00d7 10^18 eV, which is much larger than the ground state energy. Therefore, the electron will be excited to a higher energy level.\n\nStep 7: To find the new energy level, we need to solve the equation E_n = E_1 + E_transferred. Let's denote the new energy level as E_new = -13.6 / n^2 + 2.90 \u00d7 10^18 eV. We need to find n such that E_new is positive (since the energy transferred is positive).\n\nStep 8: Set up the equation: -13.6 / n^2 + 2.90 \u00d7 10^18 = 0. Solve for n.\n\nStep 9: Rearrange the equation: -13.6 / n^2 = -2.90 \u00d7 10^18. Multiply both sides by n^2: -13.6 = -2.90 \u00d7 10^18 n^2.\n\nStep 10: Divide both sides by -2.90 \u00d7 10^18: n^2 = 13.6 / (2.90 \u00d7 10^18) = 4.69 \u00d7 10^-19.\n\nStep 11: Take the square root of both sides: n = sqrt(4.69 \u00d7 10^-19) = 2.16 \u00d7 10^-9.\n\nStep 12: However, n must be an integer. Since the energy levels are quantized, n must be a positive integer. Therefore, the electron is excited to a level with n = 2.16 \u00d7 10^-9, which is not an integer. This is a problem.\n\nStep 13: Wait, the energy transferred is 2.90 \u00d7 10^18 eV, which is much larger than the ground state energy. Therefore, the electron will be excited to a very high energy level. Let's try another approach.\n\nStep 14: The energy transferred is 2.90 \u00d7 10^18 eV. The energy levels in hydrogen are given by E_n = -13.6 / n^2. Let's find the maximum energy level that the electron can reach with the transferred energy.\n\nStep 15: Set up the equation: E_n = E_1 + E_transferred = -13.6 + 2.90 \u00d7 10^18. Let's solve for n.\n\nStep 16: Rearrange the equation: -13.6 / n^2 = 2.90 \u00d7 10^18 - 13.6.

  "Step 1: The problem asks for the first ionization energy of sodium (Na) in Joules (J), rounded to three decimal places. Ionization energy is the energy required to remove an electron from a neutral atom in its ground state.\n\nStep 2: The given table lists various elements with their ionization potentials. Ionization potential is the energy required to remove one electron from a neutral atom. Therefore, the first ionization energy of an element is the energy required to remove the first electron from the neutral atom.\n\nStep 3: To find the first ionization energy of sodium (Na), we need to look up the ionization potential of sodium in the table.\n\nStep 4: The table lists the elements in a two-dimensional array, with the first column listing the elements and the second column listing their ionization potentials.

  "Step 1: First, let's recall the balanced equation for the reaction between CO and O2 to form CO2. The balanced equation is 2CO + O2 \u2192 2CO2. From this equation, we can see that 2 moles of CO react with 1 mole of O2 to produce 2 moles of CO2.\n\nStep 2: Next, let's calculate the number of moles of O2 that reacted. We are given that 32.0 g of O2 reacted. The molar mass of O2 is 32.0 g/mol. Therefore, the number of moles of O2 that reacted is 32.0 g / 32.0 g/mol = 1 mol.\n\nStep 3: Since the balanced equation shows that 1 mole of O2 reacts with 2 moles of CO, the number of moles of CO that reacted is 2 times the number of moles of O2, which is 2 * 1 = 2 moles.\n\nStep 4: To find the mass of CO that reacted, we need to multiply the number of moles of CO by the molar mass of CO. The molar mass of CO is 28.0 g/mol. Therefore, the mass of CO that reacted is 2 moles * 28.0 g/mol = 56.0 g.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, the amount of CO consumed in this reaction is 56.0 g.\n\nStep 6: Rounding to 1 decimal place, the amount of CO consumed is 56.0 g.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{56.0}",

Please format your answer as $n \\times 10^x$, where $n$ is to 1 decimal place.\n\nStep 1: First, we need to recall the formula for the deBroglie wavelength of a particle. The deBroglie wavelength (\u03bb) is given by \u03bb = h / p, where h is Planck's constant and p is the momentum of the particle.\n\nStep 2: To find the momentum (p) of the proton, we need to use the relativistic energy equation. The kinetic energy (KE) gained by the proton due to the accelerating potential (V) is given by KE = eV, where e is the charge of the proton. Since the proton is accelerated from rest, its total energy (E) is the sum of its rest energy (m\u2080c\u00b2) and the kinetic energy (KE). The momentum (p) can be found from the total energy (E) using the relativistic energy-momentum equation: E\u00b2 = (pc)^2 + (m\u2080c\u00b2)^2.\n\nStep 3: The rest energy (m\u2080c\u00b2) of a proton is approximately 938 MeV. The accelerating potential (V) is 15 Volts. We need to convert the potential from Volts to MeV. 1 MeV = 1.602 x 10^-13 J, and 1 eV = 1.602 x 10^-19 J.

  "Step 1: First, we need to recall the relationship between the wavelength and frequency of light. The speed of light in a vacuum is constant and is approximately \\(3.00 \\times 10^8\\) meters per second. The relationship between wavelength (\\(\\lambda\\)) and frequency (\\(f\\)) is given by the formula:\n\n\\[c = \\lambda \\times f\\]\n\nwhere \\(c\\) is the speed of light, \\(\\lambda\\) is the wavelength, and \\(f\\) is the frequency.\n\nStep 2: Given that the wavelength (\\(\\lambda\\)) is \\(408 \\mathrm{~nm}\\), we need to convert this to meters because the speed of light is in meters per second. The conversion factor is that \\(1 \\mathrm{~nm} = 10^{-9} \\mathrm{~m}\\).\n\nSo, \\(\\lambda = 408 \\mathrm{~nm} = 408 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{~m}\\).\n\nStep 3: Now, we can substitute the given values into the formula:\n\n\\[c = \\lambda \\times f\\]\n\n\\[3.00 \\times 10^8 = (408 \\times 10^{-9}) \\times f\\]\n\nStep 4: To find the frequency (\\(f\\)), we rearrange the formula to solve for \\(f\\):\n\n\\[f = \\frac{c}{\\lambda}\\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[f = \\frac{3.00 \\times 10^8}{408 \\times 10^{-9}}\\]\n\nStep 5: To perform this calculation, we need to handle the units carefully. The numerator is in meters per second, and the denominator is in meters. So, when we divide, the units will cancel out, leaving us with frequency in seconds per second, which is just 1/s or s^{-1}.\n\nTherefore, we can compute the frequency as follows:\n\n\\[f = \\frac{3.00 \\times 10^8}{408 \\times 10^{-9}}\\]\n\n\\[f = \\frac{3.00 \\times 10^8}{408} \\times 10^{9}\\]\n\n\\[f = \\frac{3.00 \\times 10^{8+9}}{408}\\]\n\n\\[f = \\frac{3.00 \\times 10^{17}}{408}\\]\n\n\\[f = \\frac{3.00}{408} \\times 10^{17}\\]\n\n\\[f = 7.35 \\times 10^{16} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}\\]\n\nTherefore, the frequency is \\(7.35 \\times 10^{16}\\) s^{-1}.\n\nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{7.35 \\times 10^{16}}",
  "Step 1: First, let's recall the formula to calculate the energy of a photon. The energy of a photon is given by the formula E = h * v, where h is Planck's constant and v is the frequency of the photon. However, since we are given the wavelength, we can use the formula E = h * c / \u03bb, where c is the speed of light and \u03bb is the wavelength.\n\nStep 2: We need to convert the wavelength from nanometers (nm) to meters (m) because the speed of light is typically given in meters per second (m/s). The conversion factor is 1 nm = 10^-9 m. So, 800 nm = 800 * 10^-9 m = 8 * 10^-7 m.\n\nStep 3: Planck's constant (h) is approximately 6.626 * 10^-34 J*s. The speed of light (c) is approximately 3 * 10^8 m/s.\n\nStep 4: Now, we can plug in the values into the formula E = h * c / \u03bb. So, E = (6.626 * 10^-34 J*s) * (3 * 10^8 m/s) / (8 * 10^-7 m).\n\nStep 5: First, let's calculate the numerator: (6.626 * 10^-34 J*s) * (3 * 10^8 m/s) = 19.878 * 10^-26 J*m.\n\nStep 6: Then, divide by the denominator: (19.878 * 10^-26 J*m) / (8 * 10^-7 m) = 2.485 * 10^-19 J.\n\nStep 7: To convert joules (J) to electronvolts (eV), we use the conversion factor 1 eV = 1.602 * 10^-19 J. So, we divide the energy in joules by this conversion factor: (2.485 * 10^-19 J) / (1.602 * 10^-19 J/eV) = 1.55 eV.\n\nStep 8: Rounding to two decimal places, the energy of the photon is approximately 1.55 eV.\n\nStep 9: Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{1.55}",

  "Step 1: First, let's recall the formula for the energy of a photon, which is given by E = hc/\u03bb, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and \u03bb is the wavelength of the photon.\n\nStep 2: We need to calculate the energy of the photon that strikes the hydrogen atom. The given wavelength is \u03bb = 3.091 \u00d7 10^(-7) m.

Plugging these values into the formula, we get E = (6.626 \u00d7 10^(-34) J s \u00d7 3.00 \u00d7 10^8 m/s) / (3.091 \u00d7 10^(-7) m).\n\nStep 4: Simplifying the expression, we have E = (6.626 \u00d7 3.00 \u00d7 10^(-34 + 8 - 7)) / 3.091 = (19.878 \u00d7 10^(-33)) / 3.091 = 6.44 \u00d7 10^(-33) J.\n\nStep 5: The energy of the photon is 6.44 \u00d7 10^(-33) J.\n\nStep 6: Next, we need to find the energy required to eject an electron from the excited state n = 3. The energy levels of hydrogen are given by the formula E_n = -13.6 eV / n^2. For n = 3, E_3 = -13.6 eV / 3^2 = -13.6 / 9 = -1.511 eV.\n\nStep 7: The energy required to eject the electron is the difference between the energy of the photon and the energy of the electron in the excited state. So, the energy required is 6.44 \u00d7 10^(-33) J - (-1.511 eV). First, convert the eV to J: 1 eV = 1.602 \u00d7 10^(-19) J, so -1.511 eV = -1.511 \u00d7 1.602 \u00d7 10^(-19) J = -2.43 \u00d7 10^(-19) J.\n\nStep 8: Now, subtract the two energies: 6.44 \u00d7 10^(-33) J - (-2.43 \u00d7 10^(-19) J) = 6.44 \u00d7 10^(-33) + 2.43 \u00d7 10^(-19) J. Since the second term is much larger, we can approximate the result as 2.43 \u00d7 10^(-19) J.\n\nStep 9: The energy required to eject the electron is approximately 2.43 \u00d7 10^(-19) J.\n\nStep 10: The kinetic energy of the ejected electron is equal to the energy required to eject it, which is 2.43 \u00d7 10^(-19) J.\n\nStep 11: The kinetic energy of the electron is given by the formula K = (1/2)mv^2, where m is the mass of the electron and v is its velocity. Rearranging the formula to solve for v, we get v = sqrt(2K/m).\n\nStep 12: The mass of an electron is 9.11 \u00d7 10^(-31) kg. Plugging in the values, we have v = sqrt(2 \u00d7 2.43 \u00d7 10^(-19) J / (9.11 \u00d7 10^(-31) kg)).\n\nStep 13: Simplifying the expression, we get v = sqrt(2 \u00d7 2.43 \u00d7 10^(-19) / 9.11 \u00d7 10^(-31)) = sqrt(5.26 \u00d7 10^11) = 2.29 \u00d7 10^5 m/s.\n\nStep 14: Therefore, the velocity of the ejected electron is approximately 2.29 \u00d7 10^5 m/s.\n\nStep 15: The problem asks for the velocity in m/s, so the final answer is 2.29 \u00d7 10^5 m/s.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{2.29 \u00d7 10^5}",
  "Problem: Preamble: For the element copper (Cu) determine:\n\nthe distance of second nearest neighbors (in meters). Please format your answer as $n \\times 10^x$ where $n$ is to 2 decimal places.\n\nStep 1: Identify the crystal structure of copper\nCopper is a face-centered cubic (FCC) metal. In an FCC structure, each atom is located at the corners of a cube and at the center of each face. The nearest neighbors are the atoms at the corners of the cube, and the second nearest neighbors are the atoms at the center of the adjacent faces.\n\nStep 2: Determine the lattice parameter (a) of copper\nThe lattice parameter (a) is the length of the edge of the unit cell. For copper, the lattice parameter is 3.615 \u00c5 (angstroms). We need to convert this to meters: 3.615 \u00c5 = 3.615 \u00d7 10^(-10) m.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the distance between nearest neighbors\nIn an FCC structure, the distance between nearest neighbors is \u221a2/2 times the lattice parameter (a). So, the distance between nearest neighbors is (\u221a2/2) \u00d7 a = (1.414/2) \u00d7 3.615 \u00d7 10^(-10) m = 2.55 \u00d7 10^(-10) m.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the distance between second nearest neighbors\nIn an FCC structure, the distance between second nearest neighbors is \u221a3/2 times the lattice parameter (a). So, the distance between second nearest neighbors is (\u221a3/2) \u00d7 a = (1.732/2) \u00d7 3.615 \u00d7 10^(-10) m = 3.16 \u00d7 10^(-10) m.\n\nStep 5: Format the answer as n \u00d7 10^x\nThe distance between second nearest neighbors is 3.16 \u00d7 10^(-10) m. To format this as n \u00d7 10^x, we can write it as 3.16 \u00d7 10^(-10) m = 3.16 \u00d7 10^(-10) m = 3.16 \u00d7 10^(-10) m = 3.16 \u00d7 10^(-10) m = 3.16 \u00d7 10^(-10) m = 3.16 \u00d7 10^(-10) m

  "Step 1: The Lyman series of the hydrogen spectrum corresponds to transitions from higher energy levels to the ground state (n = 1). The wavelength of the line is given as $9.50 \\times 10^{-8} {~m}$. We need to find the upper quantum state (n_i) involved in the transition.\n\nStep 2: The wavelength of the line can be related to the energy difference between the upper and lower states using the Rydberg formula. The Rydberg formula is given by:\n\n\\frac{1}{\\lambda} = R \\left( \\frac{1}{n_i^2} - \\frac{1}{n_f^2} \\right)\n\nwhere \u03bb is the wavelength, R is the Rydberg constant, n_i is the upper quantum state, and n_f is the lower quantum state. In this case, n_f = 1 (ground state).\n\nStep 3: Rearrange the Rydberg formula to solve for n_i:\n\n\\frac{1}{\\lambda} = R \\left( \\frac{1}{n_i^2} - \\frac{1}{1^2} \\right)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\frac{1}{\\lambda} = R \\left( \\frac{1}{n_i^2} - 1 \\right)\n\nStep 4: Plug in the given values:\n\n\\frac{1}{9.50 \\times 10^{-8} {~m}} = R \\left( \\frac{1}{n_i^2} - 1 \\right)\n\nStep 5: The Rydberg constant R is approximately 1.097 \\times 10^7 m^{-1}. Plug this value in:\n\n\\frac{1}{9.50 \\times 10^{-8} {~m}} = (1.097 \\times 10^7 m^{-1}) \\left( \\frac{1}{n_i^2} - 1 \\right)\n\nStep 6: Simplify the left-hand side:\n\n\\frac{1}{9.50 \\times 10^{-8} {~m}} = 1.097 \\times 10^7 m^{-1} \\left( \\frac{1}{n_i^2} - 1 \\right)\n\nStep 7: Divide both sides by 1.097 \\times 10^7 m^{-1}:\n\n\\frac{1}{9.50 \\times 10^{-8} {~m}} \\div (1.097 \\times 10^7 m^{-1}) = \\frac{1}{n_i^2} - 1\n\nStep 8: Perform the division:\n\n\\frac{1}{9.50 \\times 10^{-8} {~m}} = 1.053 \\times 10^8 m^{-1}\n\nSo:\n\n1.053 \\times 10^8 m^{-1} = \\frac{1}{n_i^2} - 1\n\nStep 9: Add 1 to both sides:\n\n1.053 \\times 10^8 m^{-1} + 1 = \\frac{1}{n_i^2}\n\nStep 10: Convert 1 to m^{-1}:\n\n1 = 1 m^{-1}\n\nSo:\n\n1.053 \\times 10^8 m^{-1} + 1 m^{-1} = \\frac{1}{n_i^2}\n\nStep 11: Combine the terms on the left-hand side:\n\n(1.053 \\times 10^8 m^{-1} + 1 m^{-1}) = \\frac{1}{n_i^2}\n\nStep 12: Convert 1.053 \\times 10^8 m^{-1} to a decimal:\n\n1.053

We can use the Arrhenius equation to model the temperature dependence of diffusivity.\nStep 2:  The Arrhenius equation is given by \\(D = D_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{Q}{RT}\\right)\\), where \\(D\\) is the diffusivity at temperature \\(T\\), \\(D_0\\) is a pre-exponential factor, \\(Q\\) is the activation energy, and \\(R\\) is the gas constant.\nStep 3:  We are given two points: at 1100\u00b0C, \\(D_{1100} = 10^{-5} \\mathrm{~cm}^2 / \\mathrm{s}\\), and at 695\u00b0C, \\(D_{695} = 10^{-6} \\mathrm{~cm}^2 / \\mathrm{s}\\). We need to find the diffusivity at 1200\u00b0C.\nStep 4:  To solve this, we can use the Arrhenius equation in a logarithmic form, which is \\(\\ln(D) = \\ln(D_0) - \\frac{Q}{RT}\\). This allows us to plot \\(\\ln(D)\\) against \\(\\frac{1}{T}\\) and obtain the slope as \\(-\\frac{Q}{R}\\) and the intercept as \\(\\ln(D_0)\\).\nStep 5:  Alternatively, we can use the two given points to set up a system of equations based on the Arrhenius equation. Let's denote the activation energy as \\(Q\\) and the pre-exponential factor as \\(D_0\\). Then, for the two temperatures, we have:\nStep 6:  At 1100\u00b0C (1373 K): \\(\\ln(D_{1100}) = \\ln(D_0) - \\frac{Q}{1373R}\\)\nStep 7:  At 695\u00b0C (968 K): \\(\\ln(D_{695}) = \\ln(D_0) - \\frac{Q}{968R}\\)\nStep 8:  Subtracting the second equation from the first gives:\nStep 9:  \\(\\ln(D_{1100}) - \\ln(D_{695}) = \\frac{Q}{968R} - \\frac{Q}{1373R}\\)\nStep 10:  Simplifying, we get:\nStep 11:  \\(\\ln\\left(\\frac{D_{1100}}{D_{695}}\\right) = Q\\left(\\frac{1}{968R} - \\frac{1}{1373R}\\right)\\)\nStep 12:  Solving for \\(Q\\), we have:\nStep 13:  \\(Q = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{D_{1100}}{D_{695}}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{1}{968R} - \\frac{1}{1373R}\\right)}\\)\nStep 14:  Once we have \\(Q\\), we can find \\(D_0\\) by substituting \\(Q\\) back into one of the original equations. Let's use the equation for 1100\u00b0C:\nStep 15:  \\(\\ln(D_{1100}) = \\ln(D_0) - \\frac{Q}{1373R}\\)\nStep 16:  Solving for \\(D_0\\), we get:\nStep 17:  \\(D_0 = D_{1100} \\exp\\left(\\frac{Q}{1373R}\\right)\\)\nStep 18:  With \\(D_0\\) and \\(Q\\) known, we can then find the diffusivity at 1200\u00b0C using the Arrhenius equation:\nStep 19:  \\(D_{1200} = D_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{Q}{1200R}\\right)\\)\nStep 20:  Therefore, we need to calculate \\(Q\\) first, then \\(D_0\\), and finally \\(D_{1200}\\).\n\nStep 21:  First, let's compute the ratio \\(\\frac{D_{1100}}{D_{695}}\\):\nStep 22:  \\(\\frac{D_{1100}}{D_{695}} = \\frac{10^{-5}}{10^{-6}} = 10^{-5} / 10^{-6} = 10^{-5+6} = 10^{1} = 10\\)\n\nStep 23:  Next, let's compute the difference in the denominators of the fractions in the equation for \\(Q\\):\nStep 24:  \\(\\frac{1}{968R} - \\frac{1}{1373R} = \\frac{1373 - 968}{968 \\times 1373R} = \\frac{405}{1324 \\times R}\\)\n\nStep 25:  Therefore, the equation for \\(Q\\) becomes:\nStep 26:  \\(Q = \\frac{\\ln(10)}{\\frac{405}{1324 \\times R}} = \\frac{1324 \\times R \\times \\ln(10)}{405}\\)\n\nStep 27:  Let's compute the value of \\(\\frac{1324 \\times R \\times \\ln(10)}{405}\\):\nStep 28:  \\(R = 8.314 \\mathrm{~J/(mol \\cdot K)}\\), \\(\\ln(10) \\approx 2.3026\\)\nStep 29:  Therefore, \\(Q = \\frac{1324 \\times 8.314 \\times 2.3026}{405} \\approx \\frac{1324 \\times 19.1}{405} \\approx \\frac{25300.4}{405} \\approx 62.4\\)\n\nStep 30:  Therefore, the activation energy \\(Q\\) is approximately 62.4 kJ/mol.\n\nStep 31:  Now, let's compute \\(D_0\\):\nStep 32:  Using the equation for 1100\u00b0C:\nStep 33:  \\(\\ln(D_{1100}) = \\ln(D_0) - \\frac{Q}{1373R}\\)\nStep 34:  Substituting \\(Q = 62.4 \\mathrm{~kJ/mol} = 62400 \\mathrm{~J/mol}\\), \\(R = 8.314 \\mathrm{~J/(mol \\cdot K)}\\), and \\(D_{1100} = 10^{-5} \\mathrm{~cm}^2 / \\mathrm{s}\\):\nStep 35:  \\(\\ln(10^{-5}) = \\ln(D_0) - \\frac{62400}{1373 \\times 8.314}\\)\nStep 36:  \\(-5 \\times \\ln(10) = \\ln(D_0) - \\frac{62400}{11400.2}\\)\nStep 37:  \\(-5 \\times 2.3026 = \\ln(D_0) - 5.47\\)\nStep 38:  \\(-11.513 = \\ln(D_0) - 5.47\\)\nStep 39:  \\(\\ln(D_0) = -11.513 + 5.47\\)\nStep 40:  \\(\\ln(D_0) = -6.043\\)\nStep 41:  Therefore, \\(D_0 = \\exp(-6.043)\\)\n\nStep 42:  Let's compute \\(\\exp(-6.043)\\):\nStep 43:  \\(\\exp(-6.043) \\approx 0.0013\\)\n\nStep 44:  Therefore, the pre-exponential factor \\(D_0\\) is approximately \\(1.3 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{~cm}^2 / \\mathrm{s}\\).\n\nStep 45:  Finally, let's compute the diffusivity at 1200\u00b0C:\nStep 46:  \\(D_{1200} = D_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{Q}{1200R}\\right)\\)\nStep 47:  Substituting \\(D_0 = 1.3 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{~cm}^2 / \\mathrm{s}\\), \\(Q = 62.4 \\mathrm{~kJ/mol} = 62400 \\mathrm{~J/mol}\\), and \\(R = 8.314 \\mathrm{~J/(mol \\cdot K)}\\):\nStep 48:  \\(D_{1200} = 1.3 \\times 10^{-3} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{62400}{1200 \\times 8.314}\\right)\\)\nStep 49:  \\(D_{1200} = 1.3 \\times 10^{-3} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{62400}{10060.8}\\right)\\)\nStep 50:  \\(D_{1200} = 1.3 \\times 10^{-3} \\exp(-6.2)\\)\n\nStep 51:  Let's compute \\(\\exp(-6.2)\\):\nStep 52:  \\(\\exp(-6.2) \\approx 0.0002\\)\n\nStep 53:  Therefore, the diffusivity at 1200\u00b0C is approximately \\(1.3 \\times 10^{-3} \\times 0.0002 = 2.6 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~cm}^2 / \\mathrm{s}\\).\n\nStep 54:  Therefore, the diffusivity of lithium in silicon at 1200\u00b0C is approximately \\(2.6 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~cm}^2 / \\mathrm{s}\\).\n\nStep 55:  Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{2.6 \\times 10^{-7}}",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of diffusion and the formation of a p-n junction in a semiconductor.\nStep 2:  First, let's recall that when antimony (Sb) diffuses into p-type germanium (Ge), it acts as a donor, converting the p-type material into n-type. The resulting p-n junction is formed at a depth where the concentration of Sb equals the acceptor concentration in the p-type Ge.\nStep 3:  The problem states that the p-n junction is formed at a depth of $3 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{~cm}$ below the surface. Therefore, at this depth, the concentration of Sb equals the acceptor concentration in the p-type Ge.\nStep 4:  We are given the surface concentration of Sb as $8 \\times 10^{18}$ $\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ and the diffusion coefficient $D_{790^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}}=4.8 \\times 10^{-11} \\mathrm{~cm}^{2} / \\mathrm{s}$.\nStep 5:  We need to find the donor concentration in the bulk germanium. Let's denote the donor concentration as $N_{D}$.\nStep 6:  The diffusion equation for Sb into Ge can be described by Fick's second law, which is given by:\n\\[ \\frac{\\partial N}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^{2} N}{\\partial x^{2}} \\]\nwhere $N$ is the concentration of Sb, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, $t$ is time, and $x$ is the depth below the surface.\nStep 7:  Since the surface concentration is held constant, we can use the steady-state solution of Fick's second law, which is given by:\n\\[ N(x) = N_{s} \\left( 1 - \\mathrm{erf} \\left( \\frac{x}{2 \\sqrt{Dt}} \\right) \\right) \\]\nwhere $N_{s}$ is the surface concentration, $x$ is the depth, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, and $t$ is time.\nStep 8:  We are given that the p-n junction is formed at a depth of $3 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{~cm}$, so we can set $x = 3 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{~cm}$ and solve for $t$.\nStep 9:  Substituting the given values, we have:\n\\[ 8 \\times 10^{18} \\left( 1 - \\mathrm{erf} \\left( \\frac{3 \\times 10^{-3}}{2 \\sqrt{4.8 \\times 10^{-11} \\times t}} \\right) \\right) = N_{D} \\]\nStep 10:  We need to solve for $t$ first. Let's denote the argument of the error function as $z = \\frac{3 \\times 10^{-3}}{2 \\sqrt{4.8 \\times 10^{-11} \\times t}}$.\nStep 11:  Then, we have:\n\\[ 8 \\times 10^{18} \\left( 1 - \\mathrm{erf}(z) \\right) = N_{D} \\]\nStep 12:  Rearranging, we get:\n\\[ N_{D} = 8 \\times 10^{18} \\left( 1 - \\mathrm{erf}(z) \\right) \\]\nStep 13:  To find $z$, we can use the fact that the p-n junction is formed at a depth of $3 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{~cm}$, so:\n\\[ z = \\frac{3 \\times 10^{-3}}{2 \\sqrt{4.8 \\times 10^{-11} \\times t}} = 1 \\]\nStep 14:  Solving for $t$, we have:\n\\[ \\frac{3 \\times 10^{-3}}{2 \\sqrt{4.8 \\times 10^{-11} \\times t}} = 1 \\]\nStep 15:  Squaring both sides, we get:\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{3 \\times 10^{-3}}{2 \\sqrt{4.8 \\times 10^{-11} \\times t}} \\right)^2 = 1 \\]\nStep 16:  Simplifying, we have:\n\\[ \\frac{9 \\times 10^{-6}}{4.8 \\times 10^{-11} \\times t} = 1 \\]\nStep 17:  Rearranging, we get:\n\\[ 4.8 \\times 10^{-11} \\times t = 9 \\times 10^{-6} \\]\nStep 18:  Solving for $t$, we have:\n\\[ t = \\frac{9 \\times 10^{-6}}{4.8 \\times 10^{-11}} \\]\nStep 19:  Calculating, we get:\n\\[ t = \\frac{9 \\times 10^{-6}}{4.8 \\times 10^{-11}} = 1.875 \\times 10^{4} \\mathrm{~s} \\]\nStep 20:  Converting to hours, we have:\n\\[ t = 1.875 \\times 10^{4} \\mathrm{~s} \\times \\frac{1 \\mathrm{~h}}{3600 \\mathrm{~s}} = 5.208 \\mathrm{~h} \\]\nStep 21:  Therefore, the time is 5.208 hours.\nStep 22:  Now that we have the time, we can substitute it back into the equation for $N_{D}$:\n\\[ N_{D} = 8 \\times 10^{18} \\left( 1 - \\mathrm{erf}(1) \\right) \\]\nStep 23:  Evaluating the error function, we have:\n\\[ \\mathrm{erf}(1) = 0.8427 \\]\nStep 24:  Therefore:\n\\[ N_{D} = 8 \\times 10^{18} \\left( 1 - 0.8427 \\right) = 8 \\times 10^{18} \\times 0.1573 \\]\nStep 25:  Calculating, we get:\n\\[ N_{D} = 1.2576 \\times 10^{18} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3} \\]\nStep 26:  Therefore, the donor concentration in the bulk germanium is $1.26 \\times 10^{18} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1.26 \\times 10^{18}}",
  "Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are given that one mole of electromagnetic radiation (photons) has an energy of 171 kJ/mole. We need to find the wavelength of this light in nanometers (nm).\n\nStep 2: Recall the relationship between energy and wavelength of photons\nThe energy (E) of a photon is related to its wavelength (\u03bb) by the formula:\n\nE = hc / \u03bb\n\nwhere h is Planck's constant (6.626 \u00d7 10^-34 J s) and c is the speed of light (approximately 3 \u00d7 10^8 m/s).\n\nStep 3: Convert the given energy from kJ to J\nFirst, we need to convert the given energy from kilojoules (kJ) to joules (J). Since 1 kJ = 1000 J, we can convert 171 kJ to J as follows:\n\n171 kJ = 171 \u00d7 1000 J = 171,000 J\n\nSo, the energy is 171,000 J per mole of photons.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the energy per photon\nSince we have one mole of photons, we need to calculate the energy per photon. The number of photons in one mole is Avogadro's number (approximately 6.022 \u00d7 10^23 photons). Therefore, the energy per photon is:\n\nEnergy per photon = Total energy / Number of photons\n= 171,000 J / (6.022 \u00d7 10^23 photons)\n= 2.84 \u00d7 10^-19 J per photon\n\nStep 5: Use the formula E = hc / \u03bb to find the wavelength\nNow, we can use the formula E = hc / \u03bb to find the wavelength. Rearranging the formula to solve for \u03bb, we get:\n\n\u03bb = hc / E\n\nSubstituting the values of h, c, and E, we get:\n\n\u03bb = (6.626 \u00d7 10^-34 J s) \u00d7 (3 \u00d7 10^8 m/s) / (2.84 \u00d7 10^-19 J)\n= (6.626 \u00d7 10^-34) \u00d7 (3 \u00d7 10^8) / (2.84 \u00d7 10^-19)\n= 6.626 \u00d7 3 / 2.84 \u00d7 10^-34 / 10^-19\n= 19.878 / 2.84 \u00d7 10^-15\n= 6.99 \u00d7 10^-7 m\n\nStep 6: Convert the wavelength from meters to nanometers\nFinally, we need to convert the wavelength from meters to nanometers. Since 1 m = 10^9 nm, we can convert 6.99 \u00d7 10^-7 m to nm as follows:\n\n6.99 \u00d7 10^-7 m = 6.99 \u00d7 10^-7 \u00d7 10^9 nm\n= 6.99 \u00d7 10^2 nm\n= 699 nm\n\nTherefore, the wavelength of the light is approximately 699 nm.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{699}",
  "Step 1: First, let's recall the formula to calculate the energy of a photon. The energy of a photon is given by E = hc/\u03bb, where E is the energy, h is Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 J s), c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s), and \u03bb is the wavelength of the radiation.\n\nStep 2: The given wavelength is 9.5 \u03bcm. First, we need to convert this wavelength from micrometers to meters. Since 1 \u03bcm = 10^-6 m, then 9.5 \u03bcm = 9.5 x 10^-6 m.\n\nStep 3: Now, we can plug in the values into the formula E = hc/\u03bb. First, let's calculate the denominator: \u03bb = 9.5 x 10^-6 m. Then, the denominator is 9.5 x 10^-6 m. The numerator is h*c = (6.626 x 10^-34 J s) * (3 x 10^8 m/s) = 19.878 x 10^-26 J. So, the energy is E = (19.878 x 10^-26 J) / (9.5 x 10^-6 m).\n\nStep 4: To perform the division, we need to divide the numerator by the denominator. First, we can simplify the numerator: 19.878 x 10^-26 J / 9.5 x 10^-6 m = (19.878 / 9.5) x 10^(-26+6) = (2.09) x 10^(-20) J.\n\nStep 5: Now, we need to convert the energy from joules to electronvolts (eV). 1 eV = 1.602 x 10^-19 J. So, to convert joules to eV, we divide by 1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV. Therefore, the energy in eV is (2.09 x 10^(-20) J) / (1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV) = (2.09 / 1.602) x 10^(-20+19) = (1.30) x 10^(-1) eV = 0.13 eV.\n\nStep 6: The problem asks for the energy to two decimal places. Therefore, rounding 0.13 eV to two decimal places gives 0.13 eV.\n\nStep 7: Therefore, the photon energy of the laser generating radiation of 9.5 \u03bcm is 0.13 eV.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{0.13}",
  "Step 1:  To find the density of copper at $100^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, we need to use the formula for density, which is given by the mass per unit volume. The mass can be calculated using the atomic mass and the number of atoms per unit cell, while the volume can be calculated using the lattice constant and the number of atoms per unit cell.\nStep 2:  First, we need to determine the number of atoms per unit cell for copper. Copper has a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure, which means that there are 4 atoms per unit cell.\nStep 3:  The atomic mass of copper is 63.55 g/mol. We need to convert this to g/atom by dividing by Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10^23 atoms/mol). So, the mass of one copper atom is 63.55 g/mol / (6.022 x 10^23 atoms/mol) = 1.055 x 10^-22 g/atom.\nStep 4:  The lattice constant is given as 3.655 \u00c5. We need to convert this to cm by multiplying by 10^-8 cm/\u00c5. So, the lattice constant in cm is 3.655 x 10^-8 cm.\nStep 5:  The volume of the unit cell is given by the cube of the lattice constant, so the volume is (3.655 x 10^-8 cm)^3 = 5.033 x 10^-23 cm^3.\nStep 6:  Since there are 4 atoms per unit cell, the mass of the unit cell is 4 atoms * 1.055 x 10^-22 g/atom = 4.220 x 10^-22 g.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the density is the mass per unit volume, which is 4.220 x 10^-22 g / 5.033 x 10^-23 cm^3 = 8.39 g/cm^3.\nStep 8:  Rounding to 2 decimal places, the density is approximately 8.39 g/cm^3.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{8.39}",

  "The AM band is typically defined as frequencies between 535 kHz and 1605 kHz. To find the minimum wavelength, we need to use the formula for wavelength:\n\n\u03bb = c / f\n\nwhere \u03bb is the wavelength, c is the speed of light (approximately 3 \u00d7 10^8 m/s), and f is the frequency.\n\nFirst, we need to find the minimum frequency in the AM band, which is 535 kHz. We need to convert this to Hz:\n\n535 kHz = 535,000 Hz\n\nNow, we can plug this into the formula:\n\n\u03bb = c / f\n= (3 \u00d7 10^8 m/s) / (535,000 Hz)\n= (3 \u00d7 10^8) / (5.35 \u00d7 10^5)\n= (3 \u00d7 10^8) / (5.35 \u00d7 10^5)\n= 5.6 \u00d7 10^3 m\n\nSo, the minimum wavelength in the AM band is approximately 5600 m.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{5600}",
  "Step 1: To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the Miller indices of a plane and the directions within that plane in a cubic crystal structure.\n\nStep 2: The (111) plane in an FCC (Face-Centered Cubic) structure is a specific plane with Miller indices (h, k, l) = (1, 1, 1). The Miller indices represent the reciprocals of the intercepts of the plane with the x, y, and z axes. For the (111) plane, the intercepts are 1 along each axis, so the Miller indices are (1, 1, 1).\n\nStep 3: Directions in a cubic crystal structure are represented by Miller indices [hkl]. The [110] direction is a specific direction with Miller indices [1, 1, 0]. To determine how many different [110]-type directions lie in the (111) plane, we need to find all directions [hkl] that are parallel to [110] and also lie in the (111) plane.\n\nStep 4: Directions that lie in a plane are those whose Miller indices satisfy the equation h + k + l = 0 (for a plane with Miller indices (h, k, l)). For the (111) plane, h + k + l = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. Directions that are parallel to [110] have Miller indices [hkl] such that h/k = 1/1 = 1 and l = 0. So, we need to find all [hkl] directions that satisfy h + k + l = 3 and h/k = 1.\n\nStep 5: Let's list the possible combinations of h, k, and l that satisfy h + k + l = 3 and h/k = 1. Since h/k = 1, we can let h = k. Then, h + h + l = 3, so 2h + l = 3. Let's solve for h and l.\n\nStep 6: Let's solve the equation 2h + l = 3.

We need to find the velocity in meters per second (m/s) and express it in the form n \u00d7 10^x, where n is a number to 2 decimal places.\n\nStep 2: Recall the relationship between energy and velocity for an electron\nThe energy imparted to an electron by an accelerating potential of one Volt is 1.6 \u00d7 10^-19 J. Therefore, for a potential of V Volts, the energy imparted is 1.6 \u00d7 10^-19 V J. Since energy is equal to 0.5 \u00d7 m \u00d7 v^2, where m is the mass of the electron and v is its velocity, we can set up the equation:\n\n1.6 \u00d7 10^-19 V J = 0.5 \u00d7 m \u00d7 v^2\n\nStep 3: Plug in the values\nThe mass of an electron is approximately 9.11 \u00d7 10^-31 kg. The potential is 150 Volts. Plugging these values into the equation:\n\n1.6 \u00d7 10^-19 \u00d7 150 = 0.5 \u00d7 9.11 \u00d7 10^-31 \u00d7 v^2\n\nStep 4: Solve for v\nFirst, calculate the left-hand side:\n\n1.6 \u00d7 10^-19 \u00d7 150 = 2.4 \u00d7 10^-17\n\nThen, rearrange the equation to solve for v^2:\n\nv^2 = (2.4 \u00d7 10^-17) / (0.5 \u00d7 9.11 \u00d7 10^-31)\n\nStep 5: Perform the division\nFirst, divide 2.4 \u00d7 10^-17 by 0.5:\n\n2.4 \u00d7 10^-17 / 0.5 = 4.8 \u00d7 10^-17\n\nThen, divide by 9.11 \u00d7 10^-31:\n\n(4.8 \u00d7 10^-17) / (9.11 \u00d7 10^-31) = 5.27 \u00d7 10^13\n\nSo, v^2 = 5.27 \u00d7 10^13\n\nStep 6: Take the square root\nTo find v, take the square root of both sides:\n\nv = \u221a(5.27 \u00d7 10^13)\n\nStep 7: Calculate the square root\nThe square root of 5.27 \u00d7 10^13 is approximately 2.30 \u00d7 10^6\n\nTherefore, the velocity of the electron is approximately 2.30 \u00d7 10^6 m/s.\n\nStep 8: Express the answer in the required format\nThe answer should be in the form n \u00d7 10^x, where n is to 2 decimal places.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to use Bragg's Law, which relates the wavelength of the radiation, the interplanar spacing of the crystal lattice, and the angle of diffraction. The formula is given by \\(2d \\sin \\theta = n\\lambda\\), where \\(d\\) is the interplanar spacing, \\(\\theta\\) is the angle of diffraction, \\(n\\) is the order of the reflection, and \\(\\lambda\\) is the wavelength of the radiation.\n\nStep 2:  First, we need to determine the wavelength of the tungsten (W) \\(L_{\\alpha}\\) radiation. The wavelength of \\(L_{\\alpha}\\) radiation is typically around 0.071 nm. However, to be precise, we should look up the exact wavelength for tungsten L\u03b1 radiation. Let's assume the wavelength is 0.071 nm.\n\nStep 3:  Next, we need to find the interplanar spacing \\(d\\) for thorium (Th). The interplanar spacing depends on the crystal structure of thorium. Thorium has a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure. The interplanar spacing can be calculated using the formula \\(d = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2}}\\), where \\(a\\) is the lattice parameter, and \\(h\\), \\(k\\), \\(l\\) are the Miller indices of the plane. For the 4th reflection, the Miller indices are (4, 0, 0), (0, 4, 0), (0, 0, 4), or (4, 4, 0), etc. However, since the Miller indices are (4, 0, 0), we can calculate the interplanar spacing using the formula.\n\nStep 4:  The lattice parameter \\(a\\) for thorium is approximately 5.84 \u00c5. Therefore, the interplanar spacing \\(d\\) for the (4, 0, 0) plane is \\(d = \\frac{5.84 \\text{ \u00c5}}{\\sqrt{4^2 + 0^2 + 0^2}} = \\frac{5.84 \\text{ \u00c5}}{4} = 1.46 \\text{ \u00c5} = 1.46 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m}\\).\n\nStep 5:  Now, we can use Bragg's Law to solve for the angle \\(\\theta\\). The formula is \\(2d \\sin \\theta = n\\lambda\\). Rearranging to solve for \\(\\theta\\), we get \\(\\sin \\theta = \\frac{n\\lambda}{2d}\\). Plugging in the values, we have \\(\\sin \\theta = \\frac{4 \\times 0.071 \\text{ nm}}{2 \\times 1.46 \\text{ nm}}\\).\n\nStep 6:  First, convert the wavelength and interplanar spacing to the same units. Since both are in nanometers, we can keep them as is. Then, compute the ratio: \\(\\frac{4 \\times 0.071 \\text{ nm}}{2 \\times 1.46 \\text{ nm}} = \\frac{0.284 \\text{ nm}}{2.92 \\text{ nm}} = 0.0973\\).\n\nStep 7:  Therefore, \\(\\sin \\theta = 0.0973\\). To find \\(\\theta\\), we take the arcsine: \\(\\theta = \\arcsin(0.0973)\\).\n\nStep 8:  Using a calculator, \\(\\arcsin(0.0973) \\approx 5.59^{\\circ}\\).\n\nStep 9:  Therefore, the angle of the 4th reflection is approximately 5.59 degrees.\n\nStep 10:  Rounding to 2 decimal places, the angle is 5.59 degrees.\n\nStep 11:  Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{5.59}",

The formula for the density of a BCC metal is given by \u03c1 = (M * N_A) / (a^3 * N), where N_A is Avogadro's number, and N is the number of atoms per unit cell in a BCC structure.\nStep 3:  In a BCC structure, there are 2 atoms per unit cell. Therefore, N = 2.\nStep 4:  The formula can be rearranged to solve for M: M = (\u03c1 * a^3 * N) / N_A.\nStep 5:  We are given \u03c1 = 16.6 g/cm^3, a = 3.31 \u00c5 = 3.31 * 10^-8 cm (converting \u00c5 to cm), and N_A = 6.022 * 10^23 mol^-1.\nStep 6:  Plugging these values into the formula, we get M = (16.6 g/cm^3 * (3.31 * 10^-8 cm)^3 * 2) / (6.022 * 10^23 mol^-1).\nStep 7:  First, calculate the volume of the unit cell: (3.31 * 10^-8 cm)^3 = 3.31 * 10^-24 cm^3.\nStep 8:  Then, multiply by the density and the number of atoms per unit cell: 16.6 g/cm^3 * 3.31 * 10^-24 cm^3 * 2 = 16.6 * 3.31 * 2 * 10^-24 g = 8.78 * 10^-23 g.\nStep 9:  Divide by Avogadro's number: (8.78 * 10^-23 g) / (6.022 * 10^23 mol^-1) = 8.78 * 10^-23 / 6.022 * 10^23 = 1.46 * 10^-1 g/mol.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the atomic weight of the metal is approximately 1.46 g/mol.\nStep 11:  Rounding to 1 decimal place, the atomic weight is 1.5 g/mol.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{1.5}",

  "Step 1: To determine the wavelength of the K\u03b1 line for molybdenum (Mo), we need to use the Moseley's law, which relates the frequency of the emitted X-ray to the atomic number (Z) of the element. The K\u03b1 line is emitted when an electron transitions from the L shell to the K shell.\n\nStep 2: The Moseley's law is given by the equation: \u03bd = (3.28 \u00d7 10^8 Z^2) / (h) * (1 - (1/(n1^2)) - (1/(n2^2))), where \u03bd is the frequency of the emitted X-ray, Z is the atomic number, h is Planck's constant, and n1 and n2 are the principal quantum numbers of the initial and final states, respectively.\n\nStep 3: For the K\u03b1 line, the initial state is the L shell (n1 = 2) and the final state is the K shell (n2 = 1). Therefore, the equation becomes: \u03bd = (3.28 \u00d7 10^8 Z^2) / (h) * (1 - (1/(2^2)) - (1/(1^2))).\n\nStep 4: We need to calculate the frequency \u03bd first. Then, we can use the speed of light (c) to find the wavelength \u03bb, which is given by \u03bb = c / \u03bd.\n\nStep 5: First, let's calculate the frequency \u03bd. The atomic number of molybdenum (Mo) is 42.

To express it in the required form, we need to move the decimal point to the left until we have a number between 0.01 and 100.\n\nStep 18: Divide the number by 10^38: 4.97 \u00d7 10^-38 / 10^38 = 4.97 \u00d7 10^(-38 - 38) = 4.97 \u00d7 10^(-76).\n\nStep 19: The number 4.97 is between 0.01 and 100, so we can express it as 4.97 \u00d7 10^(-76).\n\nStep 20: Therefore, the wavelength of the K\u03b1 line for molybdenum (Mo) is 4.97 \u00d7 10^(-76) m.\n\nStep 21: So, the final answer is \\boxed{4.97 \u00d7 10^(-76)}",

In an FCC lattice, there are 4 atoms per unit cell. The atomic mass of nickel is approximately 58.6934 g/mol. Therefore, the mass of one atom is 58.6934 g/mol / (6.022 x 10^23 atoms/mol) = 9.746 x 10^-23 g/atom.\n\nStep 3: The mass of the unit cell is 4 atoms * 9.746 x 10^-23 g/atom = 3.8984 x 10^-22 g.

Therefore, we can calculate the lattice parameter a from the volume: a = (V)^(1/3) = (4.414 x 10^-23 cm^3)^(1/3) = 3.52 x 10^-8 cm.\n\nStep 5: To convert the lattice parameter from cm to pm, we multiply by 10^10: a = 3.52 x 10^-8 cm * 10^10 pm/cm = 3.52 pm.\n\nStep 6: The second-nearest neighbor distance in an FCC lattice is the distance between two atoms that are not nearest neighbors but are closest to each other. In an FCC lattice, the second-nearest neighbors are located at a distance of a\u221a2/2, where a is the lattice parameter.\n\nStep 7: Therefore, the second-nearest neighbor distance is a\u221a2/2 = 3.52 pm * \u221a2/2 = 2.49 pm.\n\nStep 8: Therefore, the second-nearest neighbor distance in nickel at 100\u00b0C is 2.49 pm.\n\nStep 9: The problem asks for the answer in the format n x 10^x, where n is to 2 decimal places.

  "Problem: What is the working temperature for silica glass in Celsius?\n\nStep 1: Silica glass, also known as fused silica, is a type of glass made from silicon dioxide (SiO2). It is known for its high purity and resistance to thermal shock.\n\nStep 2: The working temperature of a material is the temperature range at which it can be used without suffering significant degradation or failure. For silica glass, this temperature range is typically very high.\n\nStep 3: The working temperature of silica glass is generally considered to be around 1200\u00b0C (2192\u00b0F). This is because silica glass can withstand high temperatures without deforming or shattering.\n\nStep 4: However, it's worth noting that the exact working temperature can depend on the specific application and the quality of the glass. High-purity silica glass can withstand even higher temperatures.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, the working temperature for silica glass in Celsius is approximately 1200\u00b0C.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{1200}",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to use the Bragg's law for electron diffraction, which is given by \\(2d \\sin \\theta = n \\lambda\\), where \\(d\\) is the interplanar spacing, \\(\\theta\\) is the angle of diffraction, \\(n\\) is the order of diffraction, and \\(\\lambda\\) is the wavelength of the electrons.\nStep 2:  First, we need to find the interplanar spacing \\(d\\) for the \\(\\{220\\}\\) planes of gold. The interplanar spacing can be calculated using the formula \\(d = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2}}\\), where \\(a\\) is the lattice parameter, and \\(h\\), \\(k\\), \\(l\\) are the Miller indices of the plane.\nStep 3:  For gold, the lattice parameter \\(a\\) is approximately 4.078 \u00c5.

The wavelength of electrons can be calculated using the de Broglie equation: \\(\\lambda = \\frac{h}{p}\\), where \\(h\\) is Planck's constant and \\(p\\) is the momentum of the electron. However, since we are given the angle of diffraction and the interplanar spacing, we can use the Bragg's law directly.\nStep 5:  The Bragg's law is given by \\(2d \\sin \\theta = n \\lambda\\). Rearranging this equation to solve for \\(\\lambda\\), we get \\(\\lambda = \\frac{2d \\sin \\theta}{n}\\).\nStep 6:  Since we are dealing with electron diffraction, the order of diffraction \\(n\\) is typically 1. Therefore, we can substitute the values of \\(d\\) and \\(\\theta\\) into the equation to find \\(\\lambda\\).\nStep 7:  Plugging in the values, we get:\n\\[\\lambda = \\frac{2 \\times 1.44 \\times \\sin 5^{\\circ}}{1} = \\frac{2.88 \\times 0.0872}{1} = 0.25 \\text{ \u00c5}\\]\nStep 8:  Now that we have the wavelength \\(\\lambda\\), we can use the de Broglie equation to find the momentum \\(p\\) of the electrons:\n\\[p = \\frac{h}{\\lambda} = \\frac{6.626 \\times 10^{-34}}{0.25 \\times 10^{-10}} = \\frac{6.626 \\times 10^{-34}}{2.5 \\times 10^{-11}} = 2.65 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ kg m/s}\\]\nStep 9:  The kinetic energy of the electrons can be calculated using the equation \\(E = \\frac{p^2}{2m}\\), where \\(m\\) is the mass of an electron (\\(9.11 \\times 10^{-31}\\) kg).\nStep 10:  Plugging in the values, we get:\n\\[E = \\frac{(2.65 \\times 10^{-23})^2}{2 \\times 9.11 \\times 10^{-31}} = \\frac{7.0225 \\times 10^{-46}}{1.822 \\times 10^{-30}} = 3.85 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ J}\\]\nStep 11:  To convert the kinetic energy from Joules to electronvolts (eV), we divide by the elementary charge \\(e\\) (\\(1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\) C):\n\\[E = \\frac{3.85 \\times 10^{-16}}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19}} = 2.41 \\text{ eV}\\]\nStep 12:  Therefore, the acceleration potential \\(V\\) required to cause electron diffraction on the \\(\\{220\\}\\) planes of gold at \\(\\theta = 5^{\\circ}\\) is 2.41 V.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{2}",

  "Step 1: First, let's recall the formula for calculating the vacancy fraction in a material. The vacancy fraction is given by the equation:\n\n\\[ n = N \\exp \\left( -\\frac{\\Delta H_{V}}{k_{B} T} + \\frac{S_{V}}{k_{B}} \\right) \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( n \\) is the vacancy fraction,\n- \\( N \\) is the number of lattice sites,\n- \\( \\Delta H_{V} \\) is the enthalpy of vacancy formation,\n- \\( k_{B} \\) is the Boltzmann constant,\n- \\( T \\) is the temperature in Kelvin,\n- \\( S_{V} \\) is the entropy of vacancy formation.\n\nHowever, the problem mentions an entropic prefactor, A, which is related to the entropy of vacancy formation.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to calculate the planar packing fraction of the (110) plane in aluminum at 300 K. The planar packing fraction is the ratio of the area occupied by atoms in a given plane to the total area of the plane.\n\nStep 2:  First, we need to determine the lattice parameters of aluminum. Aluminum has a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure. The lattice parameter (a) can be found from the density and atomic mass of aluminum. The density of aluminum is 2.7 g/cm\u00b3, and the atomic mass is 26.98 g/mol. We can use the formula \u03c1 = (Z \\* M) / (N_A \\* a\u00b3), where \u03c1 is the density, Z is the number of atoms per unit cell, M is the atomic mass, N_A is Avogadro's number, and a is the lattice parameter.\n\nStep 3:  For FCC, Z = 4. Rearranging the formula to solve for a, we get a = (Z \\* M / (\u03c1 \\* N_A))^(1/3). Plugging in the values, we get a = (4 \\* 26.98 / (2.7 \\* 6.022 \\* 10^23))^(1/3) = 4.05 \u00c5.\n\nStep 4:  Next, we need to find the Miller indices of the (110) plane. The Miller indices are the reciprocals of the fractional coordinates of the plane. For the (110) plane, the coordinates are (1/2, 1/2, 0). Therefore, the Miller indices are (110).\n\nStep 5:  The planar packing fraction can be calculated using the formula: packing fraction = (number of atoms per unit area) \\* (area per atom). The number of atoms per unit area can be found from the lattice parameter and the Miller indices. The area per atom can be calculated from the lattice parameter and the atomic radius.\n\nStep 6:  First, we need to find the number of atoms per unit area. The (110) plane has a rectangular unit cell with dimensions a \\* \u221a2 and a. The area of the unit cell is a\u00b2 \\* \u221a2. The number of atoms per unit area is the number of atoms per unit cell divided by the area of the unit cell. For FCC, there are 4 atoms per unit cell. Therefore, the number of atoms per unit area is 4 / (a\u00b2 \\* \u221a2).\n\nStep 7:  Next, we need to find the area per atom. The area per atom can be calculated from the lattice parameter and the atomic radius. The atomic radius of aluminum is approximately 1.43 \u00c5. The area per atom is \u03c0 \\* r\u00b2, where r is the atomic radius.\n\nStep 8:  Therefore, the planar packing fraction is (number of atoms per unit area) \\* (area per atom) = (4 / (a\u00b2 \\* \u221a2)) \\* (\u03c0 \\* r\u00b2).\n\nStep 9:  Plugging in the values, we get packing fraction = (4 / (4.05\u00b2 \\* \u221a2)) \\* (\u03c0 \\* 1.43\u00b2) = 0.345.\n\nStep 10:  Therefore, the planar packing fraction of the (110) plane in aluminum at 300 K is approximately 0.345.\n\nStep 11:  Rounding to 3 decimal places, the final answer is \\boxed{0.345}",

  "Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem is asking for the temperature at which germanium (Ge) becomes conductive, assuming no electron-hole pairs are produced until that temperature is reached. This is related to the energy gap in Ge.\n\nStep 2: Recall the relevant physics\nIn semiconductors like germanium, the energy gap (also known as the bandgap) is the energy difference between the valence band and the conduction band. At temperatures below the energy gap, the semiconductor is an insulator because there are no free charge carriers (electrons and holes). When the temperature increases, thermal energy excites electrons from the valence band to the conduction band, creating electron-hole pairs. At a certain temperature, the number of electron-hole pairs becomes significant, and the semiconductor becomes conductive.\n\nStep 3: Use the formula for thermal energy\nThe thermal energy available to excite electrons is given by the formula:\n\n\\[E_{th} = \\frac{3}{2} kT\\]\n\nwhere \\(E_{th}\\) is the thermal energy, \\(k\\) is Boltzmann's constant (\\(1.38 \\times 10^{-23} J/K\\)), and \\(T\\) is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nStep 4: Set the thermal energy equal to the energy gap\nSince the problem states that no electron-hole pairs are produced until the temperature reaches the energy gap, we can set the thermal energy equal to the energy gap (\\(E_g\\)):\n\n\\[E_{th} = E_g\\]\n\nSubstituting the formula for thermal energy:\n\n\\[\\frac{3}{2} kT = E_g\\]\n\nStep 5: Solve for temperature\nRearrange the equation to solve for temperature (\\(T\\)):\n\n\\[T = \\frac{2E_g}{3k}\\]\n\nStep 6: Plug in the energy gap for germanium\nThe energy gap for germanium is approximately 0.67 eV. Convert this to Joules:\n\n\\[E_g = 0.67 \\text{ eV} \\times 1.6 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J/eV} = 1.072 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}\\]\n\nStep 7: Calculate the temperature\nSubstitute the energy gap and Boltzmann's constant into the equation:\n\n\\[T = \\frac{2 \\times 1.072 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}}{3 \\times 1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J/K}}\\]\n\n\\[T = \\frac{2.144 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J}}{4.14 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J/K}}\\]\n\n\\[T = 5.19 \\times 10^3 \\text{ K}\\]\n\nStep 8: Convert Kelvin to Celsius\n\\[T_{Celsius} = T_{Kelvin} - 273.15\\]\n\n\\[T_{Celsius} = 5.19 \\times 10^3 - 273.15\\]\n\n\\[T_{Celsius} = 4926.85 - 273.15\\]\n\n\\[T_{Celsius} = 4653.7\\]\n\nStep 9: Format the answer\nThe problem asks for the answer in the format \\(n \\times 10^x\\) where \\(n\\) is to 1 decimal place.

  "Step 1: First, we need to understand the problem. The cubic metal has a radius of 0.77 \u00c5 and exhibits plastic deformation by slip along <111> directions. We are asked to find the planar packing density (atoms/m\u00b2) for its densest family of planes.\n\nStep 2: To solve this problem, we need to determine the densest family of planes in the cubic metal. Since the metal exhibits slip along <111> directions, the densest planes are likely to be those with the highest atomic density. In cubic metals, the <111> directions are the close-packed directions, so the densest planes are likely to be the {111} planes.\n\nStep 3: To calculate the planar packing density, we need to find the number of atoms per unit area in the densest family of planes. The planar packing density is given by the formula:\n\nPlanar packing density = (number of atoms per unit area) = (number of atoms per unit cell) / (area of the unit cell)\n\nStep 4: First, we need to find the number of atoms per unit cell. The metal is cubic, so the unit cell is a cube with edge length a. The radius of the atoms is 0.77 \u00c5. We can use the formula for the number of atoms in a cubic unit cell:\n\nNumber of atoms per unit cell = (a\u00b3) / (4 * \u03c0 * r\u00b3)\n\nwhere a is the edge length of the unit cell, and r is the radius of the atoms.\n\nStep 5: Since the metal is cubic, the edge length a is related to the radius r by the formula:\n\na = 2 * r * \u221a2\n\nSubstituting this into the formula for the number of atoms per unit cell:\n\nNumber of atoms per unit cell = (a\u00b3) / (4 * \u03c0 * r\u00b3) = (2 * r * \u221a2)\u00b3 / (4 * \u03c0 * r\u00b3) = (2 * \u221a2)\u00b3 / (4 * \u03c0) = (8 * \u221a2) / (4 * \u03c0) = 2 * \u221a2 / \u03c0 \u2248 1.11\n\nStep 6: Next, we need to find the area of the unit cell. The area of the unit cell is given by:\n\nArea of unit cell = a\u00b2 = (2 * r * \u221a2)\u00b2 = 4 * r\u00b2 * 2 = 8 * r\u00b2\n\nSubstituting the radius r = 0.77 \u00c5:\n\nArea of unit cell = 8 * (0.77)\u00b2 = 8 * 0.5929 = 4.7352 \u00c5\u00b2\n\nStep 7: Now, we can calculate the planar packing density:\n\nPlanar packing density = (number of atoms per unit cell) / (area of unit cell) = 1.11 / 4.7352 \u2248 0.234\n\nStep 8: To express the planar packing density in the required format, we need to convert it to atoms/m\u00b2. Since 1 \u00c5\u00b2 = 10\u207b\u00b9\u2070 m\u00b2, we can convert the area of the unit cell from \u00c5\u00b2 to m\u00b2:\n\nArea of unit cell (m\u00b2) = 4.7352 \u00c5\u00b2 * (10\u207b\u00b9\u2070 m\u00b2 / 1 \u00c5\u00b2) = 4.7352 * 10\u207b\u00b9\u2070 m\u00b2\n\nStep 9: Now, we can calculate the planar packing density in atoms/m\u00b2:\n\nPlanar packing density (atoms/m\u00b2) = (number of atoms per unit cell) / (area of unit cell in m\u00b2) = 1.11 / (4.7352 * 10\u207b\u00b9\u2070) \u2248 2.34 * 10\u00b9\u2070\n\nStep 10: Finally, we need to express the planar packing density in the format n \u00d7 10^x, where n is to 2 decimal places. Therefore, the planar packing density is 2.34 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2070.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{2.34 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2070}",

We can use this to find the volume of a single unit cell. Since there are 4 atoms in a unit cell, the volume of a single atom can be calculated by dividing the molar volume by the number of atoms per unit cell.\nStep 4:  The volume of a single atom is calculated as follows: volume_per_atom = molar_volume / number_of_atoms_per_unit_cell = 10.3 cm\u00b3/mole / 4 = 2.575 cm\u00b3/mole. However, since we need the volume in cm\u00b3/atom, we need to convert the molar volume to cm\u00b3/atom. Since 1 mole contains Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10\u00b2\u00b3) of atoms, we can calculate the volume per atom as follows: volume_per_atom = molar_volume / Avogadro's number = 10.3 cm\u00b3/mole / (6.022 x 10\u00b2\u00b3 atoms/mole) = 1.71 x 10\u207b\u00b2\u00b3 cm\u00b3/atom.\nStep 5:  However, the problem states that the molar volume is 10.3 cm\u00b3/mole, so we can calculate the volume of a single atom as follows: volume_per_atom = molar_volume / number_of_atoms_per_unit_cell = 10.3 cm\u00b3/mole / 4 = 2.575 cm\u00b3/mole.

  "To find the maximum wavelength of radiation capable of second order diffraction in platinum (Pt), we need to use the diffraction grating formula. The formula for the diffraction angle \u03b8 is given by:\n\nm\u03bb = d sin(\u03b8)\n\nwhere m is the order of diffraction, \u03bb is the wavelength of the radiation, d is the spacing between the grating lines, and \u03b8 is the diffraction angle.\n\nFor second order diffraction (m = 2), we want to find the maximum wavelength \u03bb. Since the diffraction angle \u03b8 is maximum when sin(\u03b8) = 1, we can set sin(\u03b8) = 1. Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n2\u03bb = d\n\nSo, the maximum wavelength \u03bb is given by:\n\n\u03bb = d / 2\n\nTo find d, we need the lattice spacing of platinum.

The formula to convert Celsius to Kelvin is:\n\\[T_{\\mathrm{K}}=T_{\\mathrm{C}}+273.15\\]\nwhere \\(T_{\\mathrm{C}}\\) is the temperature in Celsius and \\(T_{\\mathrm{K}}\\) is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nStep 3: Let's convert 20\u00b0C to Kelvin:\n\\[T_{\\mathrm{K}}=20+273.15=293.15 \\mathrm{K}\\]\n\nStep 4: Now, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\\[n_{i}=9.7 \\times 10^{15} \\times 293.15^{3 / 2} \\mathrm{e}^{-0.72 / (2 \\times 8.617 \\times 10^{-5} \\times 293.15)}\\]\n\nStep 5: First, let's calculate the exponent:\n\\[\\frac{0.72}{2 \\times 8.617 \\times 10^{-5} \\times 293.15}=\\frac{0.72}{2 \\times 8.617 \\times 10^{-5} \\times 293.15}=\\frac{0.72}{0.000503} \\approx 1430.5\\]\n\nStep 6: Then, calculate the exponential term:\n\\[\\mathrm{e}^{-1430.5} \\approx 1.0 \\times 10^{-625}\\]\n\nStep 7: Now, calculate the term \\(293.15^{3 / 2}\\):\n\\[293.15^{3 / 2} \\approx 293.15^{1.5} \\approx 293.15 \\times 293.15^{0.5} \\approx 293.15 \\times 17.1 \\approx 5000.5\\]\n\nStep 8: Multiply all the terms together:\n\\[n_{i}=9.7 \\times 10^{15} \\times 5000.5 \\times 1.0 \\times 10^{-625} \\approx 4.855 \\times 10^{15} \\times 1.0 \\times 10^{-625} \\approx 4.855 \\times 10^{-610}\\]\n\nStep 9: Since the result is extremely small, we can express it as \\(n \\times 10^x\\) where n is to 2 decimal places. In this case, n is approximately 4.86 and x is -610.\n\nStep 10: Therefore, the density of electron-hole pairs at 20\u00b0C is approximately \\(4.86 \\times 10^{-610}\\) per cubic centimeter.\n\nStep 11: However, the problem asks for the answer in the format \\(n \\times 10^x\\) where n is to 2 decimal places. Therefore, we can write the answer as \\(4.86 \\times 10^{-610}\\).\n\nStep 12: Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{4.86e-610}",

  "Step 1: First, let's identify the chemical reaction and the stoichiometry involved. The reaction is between NaI and Hg(NO3)2 to form HgI2 and NaNO3. The given reaction is:\n\n2 NaI(aq) + Hg(NO3)2(aq) \u2192 HgI2(s) + 2 NaNO3(aq)\n\nFrom the equation, 2 moles of NaI react with 1 mole of Hg(NO3)2 to produce 1 mole of HgI2. Therefore, the mole ratio of NaI to Hg(NO3)2 is 2:1.\n\nStep 2: Next, we need to calculate the number of moles of Hg2+ ions in the 45 mL of 0.10 M Hg(NO3)2 solution. Since Hg(NO3)2 is a 1:1 electrolyte, the concentration of Hg2+ ions is equal to the concentration of Hg(NO3)2. Therefore, the number of moles of Hg2+ ions is:\n\nmoles Hg2+ = Molarity \u00d7 Volume (in liters)\n\nFirst, convert the volume from milliliters to liters:\n\n45 mL = 0.045 L\n\nThen, calculate the number of moles:\n\nmoles Hg2+ = 0.10 M \u00d7 0.045 L = 0.0045 mol\n\nStep 3: Since the reaction requires 2 moles of NaI for every 1 mole of Hg2+, we need to calculate the number of moles of NaI required to precipitate all the Hg2+ ions. Let's denote the number of moles of NaI needed as x. Then, according to the stoichiometry, 2x moles of NaI would react with 0.0045 mol of Hg2+. However, since the reaction is 2:1, the number of moles of NaI required is twice the number of moles of Hg2+:\n\n2x = 0.0045 mol\n\nTherefore, x = 0.0045 / 2 = 0.00225 mol\n\nStep 4: Now, we need to calculate the volume of 0.25 M NaI solution required to provide 0.00225 mol of NaI. Let's denote the volume as V. Then, the number of moles of NaI in V liters is:\n\nmoles NaI = Molarity \u00d7 Volume (in liters)\n\n0.25 M \u00d7 V = 0.00225 mol\n\nSolve for V:\n\nV = 0.00225 mol / 0.25 M = 0.009 L\n\nStep 5: Convert the volume from liters to milliliters:\n\n0.009 L = 9 mL\n\nTherefore, the volume of 0.25 M NaI solution required to precipitate all the Hg2+ ions is 9 mL.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{9}",
  "Step 1:  The problem involves determining the depth at which the concentration of helium in a plate glass has decreased to 1/3 of its initial value after 10 minutes in a vacuum furnace at 400\u00b0C. We are given the diffusion coefficient of helium in the glass as 3.091 \u00d7 10^(-6) cm\u00b2/s. To solve this, we can use the equation for diffusion, which is given by the solution to Fick's second law of diffusion.\n\nStep 2:  Fick's second law of diffusion is given by the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x^2} \\]\n\nwhere C is the concentration of the diffusing substance (helium in this case), D is the diffusion coefficient, t is time, and x is the distance from the surface.\n\nStep 3:  Since the concentration is constant throughout the glass before vacuum treatment, we can assume that the initial concentration is C\u2080. After 10 minutes, the concentration at a depth x is C(x, t) = C\u2080 * (1/3). We need to find the depth x at which this concentration is reached.\n\nStep 4:  The solution to Fick's second law for a semi-infinite solid (where the solid is much thicker than the diffusion distance) is given by:\n\n\\[ \\frac{C(x, t)}{C_0} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ 1 - \\text{erf} \\left( \\frac{x}{2 \\sqrt{Dt}} \\right) \\right] \\]\n\nwhere erf is the error function.\n\nStep 5:  We are given that the concentration at depth x is 1/3 of the initial concentration, so we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ 1 - \\text{erf} \\left( \\frac{x}{2 \\sqrt{Dt}} \\right) \\right] \\]\n\nStep 6:  We need to solve this equation for x. First, we can rearrange the equation to isolate the error function:\n\n\\[ \\text{erf} \\left( \\frac{x}{2 \\sqrt{Dt}} \\right) = 1 - \\frac{2}{3} \\]\n\nStep 7:  Then, we can use the inverse error function (erf^(-1)) to find x:\n\n\\[ \\frac{x}{2 \\sqrt{Dt}} = \\text{erf}^{-1} \\left( 1 - \\frac{2}{3} \\right) \\]\n\nStep 8:  Let's compute the argument of the inverse error function:\n\n\\[ 1 - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3} \\]\n\nStep 9:  Therefore, we need to find the inverse error function of 1/3:\n\n\\[ \\text{erf}^{-1} \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right) \\]\n\nStep 10:  The inverse error function is denoted as erfinv. Let's compute this value.\n\nStep 11:  The inverse error function erfinv is a special function that is the inverse of the error function. It can be computed numerically or using a calculator.\n\nStep 12:  Using a calculator or numerical method, we can find that erfinv(1/3) \u2248 0.5205.\n\nStep 13:  Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ \\frac{x}{2 \\sqrt{Dt}} = 0.5205 \\]\n\nStep 14:  Now, we can solve for x:\n\n\\[ x = 2 \\sqrt{Dt} \\times 0.5205 \\]\n\nStep 15:  We are given that D = 3.091 \u00d7 10^(-6) cm\u00b2/s and t = 10 minutes = 600 seconds.\n\nStep 16:  Plugging in the values, we get:\n\n\\[ x = 2 \\sqrt{(3.091 \\times 10^{-6} \\mathrm{~cm}^2 / \\mathrm{s}) \\times (600 \\mathrm{~s})} \\times 0.5205 \\]\n\nStep 17:  Let's compute the square root:\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{(3.091 \\times 10^{-6} \\mathrm{~cm}^2 / \\mathrm{s}) \\times (600 \\mathrm{~s})} = \\sqrt{1.8546 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{~cm}^2} \\]\n\nStep 18:  Therefore, the square root is approximately 0.0431 cm.\n\nStep 19:  Then, multiplying by 2 and 0.5205:\n\n\\[ x = 2 \\times 0.0431 \\times 0.5205 \\]\n\nStep 20:  Let's compute the product:\n\n\\[ x = 0.0448 \\times 0.5205 \\]\n\nStep 21:  Therefore, x \u2248 0.0233 cm.\n\nStep 22:  To convert this to micrometers, we can multiply by 10^4 (since 1 cm = 10^4 \u03bcm):\n\n\\[ x \\approx 0.0233 \\mathrm{~cm} \\times 10^4 \\mathrm{~\u03bcm} / \\mathrm{cm} = 233 \\mathrm{~\u03bcm} \\]\n\nStep 23:  Therefore, the depth at which the concentration of helium has decreased to 1/3 of its initial value is approximately 233 \u03bcm.\n\nStep 24:  Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{233}",

  "Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem involves determining the age of whiskey suspected to be moonshine based on its tritium content. Tritium is a radioactive hydrogen isotope with a half-life of 12.5 years. The activity of the tritium in the whiskey is 6% of that found in fresh bourbon. We need to find the age of the whiskey.\n\nStep 2: Recall the formula for radioactive decay\nThe formula for radioactive decay is given by:\n\n\\[A = A_0 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{n}\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(A\\) is the current activity\n- \\(A_0\\) is the initial activity\n- \\(n\\) is the number of half-lives\n\nAlternatively, we can use the formula:\n\n\\[A = A_0 \\times e^{-\\lambda t}\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(A\\) is the current activity\n- \\(A_0\\) is the initial activity\n- \\(\\lambda\\) is the decay constant\n- \\(t\\) is the time elapsed\n\nHowever, since the half-life is given, it's easier to use the first formula.\n\nStep 3: Determine the number of half-lives\nGiven that the activity is 6% of that in fresh bourbon, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[A = 0.06 \\times A_0\\]\n\nSince the activity decreases by half with each half-life, we can express this as:\n\n\\[0.06 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n\\]\n\nwhere \\(n\\) is the number of half-lives.\n\nStep 4: Solve for n\nTo solve for n, we can take the logarithm of both sides:\n\n\\[\\log(0.06) = n \\times \\log\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\]\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that:\n\n\\[\\log(0.06) \\approx -1.22\\]\n\n\\[\\log\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -0.301\\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[-1.22 = n \\times -0.301\\]\n\nDividing both sides by -0.301:\n\n\\[n = \\frac{-1.22}{-0.301} \\approx 4.06\\]\n\nSince n must be an integer (number of half-lives), we round up to the nearest integer. However, because the activity is 6% of the original, which is less than 50%, the number of half-lives must be a whole number. Therefore, n must be 4.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the age\nGiven that n is 4 half-lives, the age of the whiskey is:\n\n\\[t = n \\times T_{1/2}\\]\n\nwhere \\(T_{1/2}\\) is the half-life of tritium, which is 12.5 years.\n\nSo:\n\n\\[t = 4 \\times 12.5 = 50\\]\n\nTherefore, the age of the whiskey is 50 years.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{50}",

  "Problem: Determine the energy gap (in eV) between the electronic states n=7 and n=8 in hydrogen. Please format your answer as n \u00d7 10^x where n is to 1 decimal place.\n\nStep 1: Recall the formula for the energy levels in a hydrogen atom. The energy of the nth state is given by E_n = -13.6 eV / n^2.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the energy of the n=7 state. E_7 = -13.6 eV / 7^2 = -13.6 eV / 49 = -0.278 eV.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the energy of the n=8 state. E_8 = -13.6 eV / 8^2 = -13.6 eV / 64 = -0.2125 eV.\n\nStep 4: Find the energy gap between the n=7 and n=8 states. The energy gap is the difference between the two energies: E_7 - E_8 = -0.278 eV - (-0.2125 eV) = -0.278 eV + 0.2125 eV = -0.0655 eV.\n\nStep 5: Express the energy gap in the required format. The energy gap is -0.0655 eV. To express this in the format n \u00d7 10^x, we need to convert the decimal part to a power of 10. Since 0.0655 is 6.55 \u00d7 10^(-2), the energy gap is -6.5 \u00d7 10^(-2) eV.\n\nStep 6: Round the coefficient to one decimal place. The coefficient is -6.5, which is already rounded to one decimal place.\n\nStep 7: Write the final answer in the required format. The energy gap is -6.5 \u00d7 10^(-2) eV.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{-6.5 \u00d7 10^(-2)}",
  "Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem is asking for the maximum age of a sample that can be dated using the decay rate of ${ }^{14} \\mathrm{C}$. The decay rate is given as 15.3 disintegrations per minute per gram of carbon, with an experimental uncertainty of \u00b10.1 disintegrations per minute per gram. The half-life of ${ }^{14} \\mathrm{C}$ is 5730 years.\n\nStep 2: Recall the formula for radioactive decay\nThe formula for radioactive decay is:\n\nN(t) = N0 * e^(-\u03bbt)\n\nwhere:\n- N(t) is the amount of the radioactive substance remaining after time t\n- N0 is the initial amount of the substance\n- \u03bb is the decay constant (related to the half-life)\n- t is the time elapsed\n\nAlternatively, the formula can be expressed in terms of the half-life (T1/2):\n\n\u03bb = ln(2) / T1/2\n\nwhere ln(2) is the natural logarithm of 2.\n\nStep 3: Determine the decay constant (\u03bb)\nGiven the half-life (T1/2) is 5730 years, we can calculate the decay constant (\u03bb):\n\n\u03bb = ln(2) / T1/2\n= ln(2) / 5730\n= 0.693147 / 5730\n\u2248 0.000121\n\nStep 4: Calculate the maximum age\nThe maximum age is the time at which the amount of the radioactive substance remaining is equal to the experimental uncertainty (\u00b10.1 disintegrations per minute per gram). We can set up the equation:\n\nN(t) = N0 * e^(-\u03bbt) = \u00b10.1\n\nSince the initial amount (N0) is not given, we can assume that the initial amount is the same as the decay rate (15.3 disintegrations per minute per gram). Therefore:\n\n15.3 * e^(-\u03bbt) = \u00b10.1\n\nDivide both sides by 15.3:\n\ne^(-\u03bbt) = \u00b10.1 / 15.3\n\u2248 \u00b10.0065\n\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\n-\u03bbt = ln(\u00b10.0065)\n\u2248 -4.5\n\nDivide both sides by -\u03bb:\n\nt = -4.5 / (-0.000121)\n\u2248 37200 years\n\nTherefore, the maximum age of a sample that can be dated is approximately 37200 years.\n\nStep 5: Write the final answer\nThe maximum age of a sample that can be dated is approximately 37200 years.\n\nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{37200}",
  "Step 1: Understand the problem and the given information. We are asked to estimate the ionic radius of Cs+ in Angstroms to 2 decimal places. The lattice energy of CsCl is given as 633 kJ/mol. The Madelung constant (M) is 1.763, the Born exponent (n) is 10.7, and the ionic radius of Cl- is 1.81 \u00c5.\n\nStep 2: Recall the Born-Lande equation, which relates the lattice energy (U) of an ionic crystal to the Madelung constant (M), the Born exponent (n), the charge of the ions (z), the dielectric constant of the crystal (\u03b5), and the distance between the ions (r). The equation is:\n\nU = (M * z^2 * e^2) / (4 * \u03c0 * \u03b5 * r)\n\nwhere e is the elementary charge, and \u03b5 is the dielectric constant of the crystal.\n\nStep 3: Rearrange the Born-Lande equation to solve for r:\n\nr = (M * z^2 * e^2) / (4 * \u03c0 * \u03b5 * U)\n\nStep 4: Note that the dielectric constant (\u03b5) is not given, but we can use the Clausius-Mossotti equation to relate \u03b5 to the lattice energy (U) and the ionic radii (r+ and r-). The equation is:\n\n\u03b5 = (1 + (4 * \u03c0 * (r+ + r-)^3) / (3 * V)) / (1 - (4 * \u03c0 * (r+ + r-)^3) / (3 * V))\n\nwhere V is the volume of the unit cell.\n\nStep 5: However, since we are given the lattice energy (U) and the ionic radius of Cl- (r-), we can use the Born-Lande equation to estimate the ionic radius of Cs+ (r+). We can rearrange the equation to solve for r+:\n\nr+ = (M * z+^2 * e^2) / (4 * \u03c0 * \u03b5 * U) - r-\n\nwhere z+ is the charge of the cation (1 for Cs+).\n\nStep 6: Since \u03b5 is not given, we can use the fact that the lattice energy (U) is related to the ionic radii (r+ and r-) through the Madelung constant (M) and the Born exponent (n). The equation is:\n\nU = (M * z+^2 * z-^2 * e^2) / (4 * \u03c0 * \u03b5 * (r+ + r-)^n)\n\nStep 7: Rearrange the equation to solve for \u03b5:\n\n\u03b5 = (M * z+^2 * z-^2 * e^2) / (4 * \u03c0 * U * (r+ + r-)^n)\n\nStep 8: Substitute the expression for \u03b5 into the equation for r+:\n\nr+ = (M * z+^2 * e^2) / (4 * \u03c0 * (M * z+^2 * z-^2 * e^2) / (4 * \u03c0 * U * (r+ + r-)^n) * U) - r-\n\nStep 9: Simplify the equation:\n\nr+ = (M * z+^2 * e^2) / (M * z+^2 * z-^2 * e^2) * (r+ + r-)^n - r-\n\nStep 10: Note that z+ = 1 and z- = -1 for CsCl. Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\nr+ = (M * e^2) / (M * e^2) * (r+ + r-)^n - r-\n\nStep 11: Simplify the equation:\n\nr+ = (r+ + r-)^n - r-\n\nStep 12: Substitute the given values:\n\nM = 1.763, n = 10.7, r- = 1.81 \u00c5\n\nStep 13: Let r+ = x.

We need to calculate the molar crystal energy (\u0394Ecryst) for CsCl.\n\nStep 2: Recall the formula for calculating the crystal energy.\nThe crystal energy can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\u0394Ecryst = -M \u00d7 (Z+ \u00d7 Z- \u00d7 e^2 / (4\u03c0\u03b5\u2080r\u2080))\n\nwhere:\n- M is the Madelung constant,\n- Z+ and Z- are the charges of the cation and anion, respectively,\n- e is the elementary charge,\n- \u03b5\u2080 is the vacuum permittivity,\n- r\u2080 is the distance between the centers of the ions.\n\nStep 3: Determine the distance between the centers of the ions (r\u2080).\nSince CsCl is a rock-salt structure, the ions are arranged in a cubic lattice. The distance between the centers of the ions can be calculated using the ionic radii.\n\nFor a rock-salt structure, the distance between the centers of the ions is given by:\n\nr\u2080 = (r+ + r-) / \u221a2\n\nwhere r+ and r- are the ionic radii of the cation and anion, respectively.\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\nr\u2080 = (1.67 + 1.81) / \u221a2\n= 3.48 / \u221a2\n= 3.48 / 1.414\n= 2.46 \u00c5\n\nStep 4: Convert the distance from \u00c5 to meters.\n1 \u00c5 = 10^(-10) m\n\nSo, r\u2080 = 2.46 \u00d7 10^(-10) m\n\nStep 5: Calculate the crystal energy.\nSubstitute the given values into the formula:\n\n\u0394Ecryst = -M \u00d7 (Z+ \u00d7 Z- \u00d7 e^2 / (4\u03c0\u03b5\u2080r\u2080))\n\nwhere:\n- M = 1.763,\n- Z+ = 1 (Cs+),\n- Z- = -1 (Cl-),\n- e = 1.602 \u00d7 10^(-19) C,\n- \u03b5\u2080 = 8.854 \u00d7 10^(-12) F/m,\n- r\u2080 = 2.46 \u00d7 10^(-10) m\n\nSubstituting these values:\n\n\u0394Ecryst = -1.763 \u00d7 (1 \u00d7 (-1) \u00d7 (1.602 \u00d7 10^(-19))^2 / (4\u03c0 \u00d7 8.854 \u00d7 10^(-12) \u00d7 2.46 \u00d7 10^(-10)))\n= -1.763 \u00d7 (1 \u00d7 (-1) \u00d7 2.57 \u00d7 10^(-38) / (4\u03c0 \u00d7 8.854 \u00d7 10^(-12) \u00d7 2.46 \u00d7 10^(-10)))\n= -1.763 \u00d7 (-2.57 \u00d7 10^(-38) / (1.11 \u00d7 10^(-10)))\n= -1.763 \u00d7 (-2.31 \u00d7 10^28)\n= 4.06 \u00d7 10^28 J\n\nStep 6: Convert the crystal energy from J to J/mole.\n1 mole = 6.022 \u00d7 10^23 particles\n\nSo, the crystal energy per mole is:\n\n\u0394Ecryst (per mole) = 4.06 \u00d7 10^28 J / (6.022 \u00d7 10^23)\n= 6.75 \u00d7 10^4 J/mole\n\nStep 7: Express the answer in the required format.\nThe answer should be in the format n \u00d7 10^x, where n is to 2 decimal places.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n6.75 \u00d7 10^4 J/mole\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{6.75 \u00d7 10^4}",
  "Step 1: First, let's understand the problem. We have 1 kg of germanium (Ge) and we want to find out how much boron (B) needs to be substitutionally incorporated into it to achieve a charge carrier density of 3.091 x 10^17 / cm^3.\n\nStep 2: To solve this, we need to recall the relationship between the concentration of dopants (in this case, boron) and the charge carrier density in a semiconductor. The charge carrier density is given by the equation:\n\nn = N_d \\* (1 + N_d / N_a)\n\nwhere n is the charge carrier density, N_d is the concentration of donor dopants (in this case, boron is a p-type dopant, so it acts as an acceptor), and N_a is the concentration of acceptor dopants (in this case, boron).\n\nHowever, since boron is a p-type dopant, it will act as an acceptor, so the equation becomes:\n\nn = N_d \\* (1 + N_d / N_a)\n\nBut since we are dealing with a p-type semiconductor, the charge carrier density is given by the equation:\n\nn = N_d\n\nSo, the charge carrier density is equal to the concentration of boron (N_d).\n\nStep 3: We are given that the desired charge carrier density is 3.091 x 10^17 / cm^3. Therefore, the concentration of boron (N_d) must be equal to this value.\n\nStep 4: To find the amount of boron in grams, we need to convert the concentration from / cm^3 to / kg. Since 1 kg = 1000 g, we can convert the concentration as follows:\n\nN_d (in / kg) = N_d (in / cm^3) \\* (1 cm^3 / 1000 g)\n\nTherefore, the concentration of boron in / kg is:\n\nN_d (in / kg) = 3.091 x 10^17 / cm^3 \\* (1 cm^3 / 1000 g) = 3.091 x 10^14 / g\n\nStep 5: To find the amount of boron in grams, we can use the formula:\n\nAmount of boron = Concentration of boron \\* Mass of germanium\n\nSince the mass of germanium is 1 kg = 1000 g, the amount of boron is:\n\nAmount of boron = 3.091 x 10^14 / g \\* 1000 g = 3.091 x 10^17 g\n\nStep 6: Therefore, the amount of boron needed to achieve a charge carrier density of 3.091 x 10^17 / cm^3 in 1 kg of germanium is 3.091 x 10^17 g.\n\nStep 7: However, the problem asks for the answer in the format n x 10^x, where n is to 2 decimal places. Therefore, we need to express 3.091 x 10^17 as 3.09 x 10^17.\n\nStep 8: Therefore, the final answer is 3.09 x 10^17.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{3.09 x 10^17}",

Please format your answer as \\( n \\times 10^x \\) where \\( n \\) is to 2 decimal places.\n\nStep 1: First, we need to understand what linear density of atoms means. Linear density is the number of atoms per unit length. In this case, we're looking for the highest linear density of atoms in vanadium (V).\n\nStep 2: To find the highest linear density, we need to know the crystal structure of vanadium. Vanadium is a metal that can exist in several allotropes, but the most common one is alpha-vanadium, which has a body-centered cubic (BCC) crystal structure.\n\nStep 3: The BCC structure has a lattice parameter (a) that defines the spacing between atoms. The lattice parameter for alpha-vanadium is approximately 3.028 \u00c5 (angstroms).\n\nStep 4: The BCC structure has 2 atoms per unit cell. Therefore, the number of atoms per unit length (linear density) can be calculated by dividing the number of atoms per unit cell by the lattice parameter.\n\nStep 5: The lattice parameter is given in angstroms (\u00c5), so we need to convert it to meters (m) to get the linear density in atoms/m. 1 \u00c5 = 10^-10 m.\n\nStep 6: Therefore, the lattice parameter in meters is 3.028 \u00c5 * 10^-10 m/\u00c5 = 3.028 * 10^-10 m.\n\nStep 7: The number of atoms per unit length is 2 atoms / (3.028 * 10^-10 m) = 2 / (3.028 * 10^-10) = 6.61 * 10^9 atoms/m.\n\nStep 8: Therefore, the highest linear density of atoms in vanadium is 6.61 * 10^9 atoms/m.\n\nStep 9: Since the problem asks to format the answer as n \u00d7 10^x where n is to 2 decimal places, we can write the answer as 6.61 \u00d7 10^9.\n\nStep 10: Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{6.61 \u00d7 10^9}",

Then, the concentrations of Sr2+ and F- are also x. Since each mole of SrF2 produces one mole of Sr2+ and two moles of F-, the concentrations are:\n[Sr2+] = x\n[F-] = 2x\n\nSubstituting these into the Ksp equation:\nKsp = [Sr2+][F-]^2 = x(2x)^2 = 4x^3\n\nStep 5: Solve for x\nGiven Ksp = 2.45 \u00d7 10^(-9), we can set up the equation:\n4x^3 = 2.45 \u00d7 10^(-9)\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\nx^3 = (2.45 \u00d7 10^(-9)) / 4 = 6.125 \u00d7 10^(-10)\n\nTake the cube root of both sides:\nx = \u221b(6.125 \u00d7 10^(-10))\n\nUsing a calculator, x \u2248 1.58 \u00d7 10^(-3)\n\nStep 6: Express the answer in the required format\nThe answer should be in the form n \u00d7 10^x, where n is to 2 decimal places.

We are asked to calculate the energy of the incident beam, expressed in eV, and as an integer.\n\nStep 2:  To solve this problem, we can use the concept of the Compton scattering formula, which relates the energy of the incident photon to the energy of the scattered photon. However, in this case, the electrons are scattered by the crystal, so we need to consider the energy transfer from the incident electrons to the crystal lattice.\n\nStep 3:  The energy of the incident electrons can be calculated using the formula for the kinetic energy of an electron: $E = \\frac{1}{2} m v^2$, where $m$ is the mass of the electron and $v$ is its velocity.\n\nStep 4:  The mass of an electron is $9.11 \\times 10^{-31} \\mathrm{~kg}$, and the velocity is given as $4.4 \\times 10^{5} \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$.

Since the energy of the incident electrons is less than the band gap, they are likely to be absorbed by the crystal, rather than being scattered. Therefore, the energy of the incident beam is likely to be 0 eV.\n\nStep 12:  Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{0}",

The cost of capital is \\( r \\) and the wage is \\( w \\). Both inputs are variable, and there are no fixed costs. We need to find the marginal rate of technical substitution (MRTS) of labor for capital.\n\nStep 2: Recall the definition of MRTS\nThe marginal rate of technical substitution (MRTS) of labor for capital is the rate at which one input can be substituted for another without changing the output level. Mathematically, it is defined as the ratio of the marginal product of labor (MPL) to the marginal product of capital (MPK).\n\nStep 3: Compute the marginal product of labor (MPL)\nTo find MPL, we take the partial derivative of the production function with respect to labor (L). Let's denote the production function as \\( F(K, L) = (K-1)^{\\frac{1}{4}} L^{\\frac{1}{4}} \\).\n\nMPL = \u2202F/\u2202L = (1/4) (K-1)^(-3/4) L^(3/4)\n\nStep 4: Compute the marginal product of capital (MPK)\nTo find MPK, we take the partial derivative of the production function with respect to capital (K). Let's denote the production function as \\( F(K, L) = (K-1)^{\\frac{1}{4}} L^{\\frac{1}{4}} \\).\n\nMPK = \u2202F/\u2202K = (1/4) (K-1)^(-3/4) L^(1/4)\n\nStep 5: Compute the MRTS\nThe MRTS of labor for capital is the ratio of MPL to MPK.\n\nMRTS = MPL / MPK = (1/4) (K-1)^(-3/4) L^(3/4) / (1/4) (K-1)^(-3/4) L^(1/4)\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n\nMRTS = L^(3/4) / L^(1/4) = L^(2/4) = L^(1/2)\n\nTherefore, the MRTS of labor for capital is L^(1/2), which is the square root of labor.\n\nStep 6: Write the final answer\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{L^(1/2)}",
  "The problem is not explicitly stated, but based on the context, it seems that we are dealing with a firm's cost minimization problem in the long run. The two conditions are likely related to the firm's optimal capital level, which minimizes its costs.\n\nLet's denote the firm's capital as K. The two conditions are:\n\n1. The firm's long-run average cost (LRAC) is minimized at the optimal capital level K. This is the condition that involves the SRAC.\n\n2. The firm's long-run marginal cost (LMC) equals the long-run average cost (LRAC) at the optimal capital level K. This is the condition that involves the SRAC and the LMC.\n\nThe SRAC is the short-run average cost, which is the total cost divided by the output. The LRAC is the long-run average cost, which is the total cost divided by the output when the firm is operating at the optimal capital level.\n\nThe LMC is the long-run marginal cost, which is the additional cost of producing one more unit of output when the firm is operating at the optimal capital level.\n\nTherefore, the condition that involves the SRAC is:\n\nCondition 1: The SRAC is minimized at the optimal capital level K.\n\nMathematically, this can be written as:\n\nSRAC(K) = min SRAC(x) for all x \u2265 0\n\nwhere x is the output level.\n\nAlternatively, the condition can be written as:\n\nSRAC(K) \u2264 SRAC(x) for all x \u2260 K\n\nThis means that the SRAC at the optimal capital level K is less than or equal to the SRAC at any other output level x.\n\nTherefore, the condition that involves the SRAC is:\n\nSRAC(K) = min SRAC(x) for all x \u2265 0\n\nSo, the condition is that the SRAC is minimized at the optimal capital level K.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{SRAC(K) = min SRAC(x) for all x \u2265 0}",

  "Step 1: Understand the problem context\nThe problem involves a short-run industry supply function for widgets, where the output is supplied by 100 identical competitive firms.

We need to derive the short-run industry supply function.\n\nStep 2: Recall the concept of short-run industry supply\nIn the short run, firms can adjust their output but not their scale of production. The industry supply function is the total output supplied by all firms in the industry as a function of the market price. Since all firms are identical and competitive, they will produce the same quantity at each price.\n\nStep 3: Derive the short-run firm supply function\nFirst, we need to derive the short-run firm supply function. The firm's profit is given by \\(\\pi = p y - c_{s}(y)\\), where \\(p\\) is the market price and \\(y\\) is the firm's output. Since the firm is competitive, it will produce where marginal revenue (MR) equals marginal cost (MC). The MR is the derivative of the total revenue with respect to output, which is \\(p\\). The MC is the derivative of the cost function with respect to output, which is \\(\\frac{d}{dy}(\\frac{1}{3}y^{3} + 2) = y^{2}\\).\n\nTherefore, the firm will produce where \\(p = y^{2}\\).\n\nStep 4: Express the firm's output in terms of the market price\nFrom the equation \\(p = y^{2}\\), we can solve for \\(y\\) as a function of \\(p\\): \\(y = \\sqrt{p}\\).\n\nStep 5: Derive the short-run industry supply function\nSince all firms are identical and competitive, each firm will produce \\(\\sqrt{p}\\) at each price. The total output supplied by all firms is the number of firms multiplied by the output of each firm, which is \\(100 \\times \\sqrt{p}\\).\n\nTherefore, the short-run industry supply function is \\(y = 100 \\times \\sqrt{p}\\).\n\nStep 6: Write the final answer\nThe short-run industry supply function for widgets is \\(y = 100 \\times \\sqrt{p}\\).\n\nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{100 \\sqrt{p}}",

  "Step 1: The consumer's utility function is given as u(x, y) = x^(1/2) + y. We need to find the marginal rate of substitution (MRS) at an arbitrary point (X, Y), where X > 0 and Y > 0.\n\nStep 2: The MRS is defined as the ratio of the marginal utility of good x to the marginal utility of good y.

  "Step 1: Understand the problem context\nThe city of Cambridge needs to set a price for apples that balances the demand and supply. There are two sources: a local orchard that can produce up to 50 apples per day at a marginal cost of 25 cents, and a store that can supply any remaining demand at a marginal cost of 75 cents. The residents buy 150 apples when the price is 75 cents.\n\nStep 2: Determine the demand function\nSince the residents buy 150 apples when the price is 75 cents, we can use this information to find the demand function. Let's denote the price as P and the quantity demanded as Q. We know that at P = 75 cents, Q = 150. However, we need to find the demand function that relates P and Q.\n\nStep 3: Find the demand function\nSince the demand is 150 apples at 75 cents, we can assume that the demand function is linear. Let's assume the demand function is Q = aP + b, where a and b are constants. We can use the given point (75, 150) to find the values of a and b.\n\nStep 4: Use the given point to find a and b\nSubstitute the given point (75, 150) into the demand function Q = aP + b:\n\n150 = 75a + b\n\nStep 5: Solve for a and b\nWe have two equations:\n\n1) 150 = 75a + b\n2) At P = 0, Q = 0 (since at zero price, demand is zero)\n\nSubstitute P = 0 into the demand function:\n\n0 = a(0) + b\nb = 0\n\nNow substitute b = 0 into the first equation:\n\n150 = 75a + 0\n150 = 75a\na = 2\n\nSo, the demand function is Q = 2P.\n\nStep 6: Find the supply function\nThe local orchard can produce up to 50 apples per day at a marginal cost of 25 cents. The store can supply any remaining demand at a marginal cost of 75 cents. Let's denote the price as P and the quantity supplied as S. The supply function is S = cP + d, where c and d are constants.\n\nStep 7: Find the supply function\nSince the local orchard produces 50 apples at a marginal cost of 25 cents, we can assume that the supply function is S = 50 when P = 25. However, the store supplies any remaining demand at a marginal cost of 75 cents. Let's assume that the store's supply is S = 50 + (Q - 50) * (75 - 25) / (75 - 25) = 50 + (Q - 50) * 50 / 50 = 50 + (Q - 50) = 50 + Q - 50 = Q.\n\nSo, the total supply is the sum of the local orchard's supply (50 apples) and the store's supply (Q). Therefore, the total supply is S = 50 + Q.\n\nStep 8: Equate demand and supply\nTo find the equilibrium price, we need to equate the demand and supply:\n\nQ = S\nQ = 50 + Q\n\nStep 9: Solve for Q\nSubtract Q from both sides:\n\n0 = 50\n\nThis is a contradiction, which means that the supply is not equal to the demand. However, we can try to find the equilibrium price by setting the marginal revenue equal to the marginal cost.\n\nStep 10: Find the marginal revenue and marginal cost\nThe marginal revenue is the derivative of the total revenue with respect to quantity. The total revenue is P * Q. The marginal revenue is d(TR)/dQ = P + Q * dP/dQ.\n\nThe marginal cost is the derivative of the total cost with respect to quantity. The total cost is the sum of the costs from the local orchard and the store. The local orchard's cost is 25 * 50 = 1250. The store's cost is 75 * (Q - 50). Therefore, the total cost is 1250 + 75 * (Q - 50) = 1250 + 75Q - 3750 = 75Q - 2500. The marginal cost is d(TC)/dQ = 75.\n\nStep 11: Equate marginal revenue and marginal cost\nTo find the equilibrium quantity, we equate the marginal revenue and marginal cost:\n\nP + Q * dP/dQ = 75\n\nSince the demand function is Q = 2P, we can substitute Q = 2P into the equation:\n\nP + 2P * dP/dQ = 75\n\nStep 12: Find dP/dQ\nSince Q = 2P, dQ/dP = 2. Therefore, dP/dQ = 1 / (dQ/dP) = 1 / 2.\n\nStep 13: Substitute dP/dQ into the equation\nSubstitute dP/dQ = 1/2 into the equation:\n\nP + 2P * (1/2) = 75\n\nSimplify:\n\nP + P = 75\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2P = 75\n\nDivide by 2:\n\nP = 75 / 2\n\nP = 37.5\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium price is 37.5 cents.\n\nStep 14: Verify the solution\nTo verify, we can check if the demand and supply are equal at P = 37.5.\n\nDemand: Q = 2P = 2 * 37.5 = 75\n\nSupply: S = 50 + Q = 50 + 75 = 125\n\nSince Q = 75 and S = 125, the demand is less than the supply. However, the problem states that the residents buy 150 apples when the price is 75 cents. Therefore, the demand is 150 at P = 75, which is more than the supply. Therefore, the equilibrium price is 37.5 cents.\n\nTherefore, the city of Cambridge should set the price at 37.5 cents.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{37.5}",

The factory is facing a lawsuit due to food poisoning, and Judge Judy is considering two options as equivalent: either pay a lump sum equal to the profits or impose a tax on each can equal to the profit per can. We need to find the tax amount in dollars per can.\n\nStep 2: Determine the profit-maximizing output\nTo find the profit-maximizing output, we need to use the marginal cost (MC) and average total cost (ATC) information provided. The profit-maximizing output occurs where MC equals ATC.\n\nFrom the given data:\n- At q = 5, MC(5) = 10 and ATC(5) = 6.\n- At q = 4, MC(4) = 4 and ATC(4) = 4.\n\nSince MC(5) > ATC(5), the profit-maximizing output is at q = 4, where MC(4) = ATC(4) = 4.\n\nTherefore, the profit-maximizing output is q* = 4.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the profit per can\nThe profit per can is the difference between the market price and the average total cost at the profit-maximizing output.\n\nMarket price = $10 per can\nATC(q*) = ATC(4) = 4\n\nProfit per can = Market price - ATC(q*) = 10 - 4 = $6 per can\n\nTherefore, the tax is $\\left[P - ATC\\left(q^{*}\\right)\\right] = 6$ dollars per can.\n\nSo, the tax amount is $6 per can.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{6}",
  "Step 1: Understand the problem and the given information. We are dealing with two consumers, Albie and Bubbie, who demand strawberries.

We need to find Albie's own-price elasticity of demand, \\(\\epsilon_{q_{a}, p}\\), using the formula \\(\\epsilon_{y, x} = \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x} \\frac{x}{y}\\).\n\nStep 2: Recall the formula for own-price elasticity of demand. The own-price elasticity of demand is given by \\(\\epsilon_{q_{a}, p} = \\frac{\\partial q_{a}}{\\partial p} \\frac{p}{q_{a}}\\). We need to compute \\(\\frac{\\partial q_{a}}{\\partial p}\\) and then substitute into the formula.\n\nStep 3: Compute \\(\\frac{\\partial q_{a}}{\\partial p}\\). Given that \\(q_{a}(p) = p^{\\alpha} f_{a}(I_{a})\\), we can use the product rule to find the derivative. The derivative of \\(p^{\\alpha}\\) with respect to \\(p\\) is \\(\\alpha p^{\\alpha - 1}\\), and the derivative of \\(f_{a}(I_{a})\\) with respect to \\(p\\) is zero since \\(f_{a}\\) is a function of \\(I_{a}\\), which is not a function of \\(p\\). Therefore, \\(\\frac{\\partial q_{a}}{\\partial p} = \\alpha p^{\\alpha - 1} f_{a}(I_{a})\\).\n\nStep 4: Substitute \\(\\frac{\\partial q_{a}}{\\partial p}\\) into the formula for own-price elasticity of demand. Plugging in, we get \\(\\epsilon_{q_{a}, p} = \\alpha p^{\\alpha - 1} f_{a}(I_{a}) \\frac{p}{p^{\\alpha} f_{a}(I_{a})}\\).\n\nStep 5: Simplify the expression. Canceling out \\(p^{\\alpha}\\) and \\(f_{a}(I_{a})\\) in the numerator and denominator, we get \\(\\epsilon_{q_{a}, p} = \\alpha \\frac{p}{p^{\\alpha}}\\).\n\nStep 6: Further simplify. Since \\(\\frac{p}{p^{\\alpha}} = p^{1 - \\alpha}\\), we have \\(\\epsilon_{q_{a}, p} = \\alpha p^{1 - \\alpha}\\).\n\nStep 7: Note that the expression \\(\\alpha p^{1 - \\alpha}\\) is a function of \\(p\\), but since we are asked to find the elasticity, which is a measure of how responsive demand is to price changes, we can consider the elasticity at a specific price or in general. However, the problem does not specify a particular price, so we can leave the expression as is.\n\nStep 8: However, elasticity is typically a constant value that does not depend on the price. Therefore, the expression \\(\\alpha p^{1 - \\alpha}\\) is not a constant, so it cannot be the elasticity. This seems to be a contradiction.\n\nStep 9: Revisit the problem and the formula for elasticity. The formula \\(\\epsilon_{y, x} = \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x} \\frac{x}{y}\\) implies that elasticity is a ratio of the derivative of the variable to the variable itself, multiplied by the variable. In this case, \\(\\epsilon_{q_{a}, p} = \\frac{\\partial q_{a}}{\\partial p} \\frac{p}{q_{a}}\\). However, the derivative \\(\\frac{\\partial q_{a}}{\\partial p}\\) is \\(\\alpha p^{\\alpha - 1} f_{a}(I_{a})\\), and the ratio \\(\\frac{p}{q_{a}} = \\frac{p}{p^{\\alpha} f_{a}(I_{a})} = \\frac{1}{p^{\\alpha - 1} f_{a}(I_{a})}\\). Multiplying these two expressions, we get \\(\\epsilon_{q_{a}, p} = \\alpha p^{\\alpha - 1} f_{a}(I_{a}) \\frac{1}{p^{\\alpha - 1} f_{a}(I_{a})} = \\alpha\\).\n\nStep 10: Therefore, the own-price elasticity of demand for Albie is \\(\\alpha\\).\n\nStep 11: Note that the elasticity is a constant value, which is \\(\\alpha\\). This makes sense because elasticity is a measure of how responsive demand is to price changes, and in this case, the demand function is \\(q_{a}(p) = p^{\\alpha} f_{a}(I_{a})\\). The exponent \\(\\alpha\\) determines how responsive demand is to price changes. Therefore, the elasticity is \\(\\alpha\\).\n\nStep 12: Therefore, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{\\alpha}\\).",
  "Step 1: Understand the problem and the given information.\n\nWe are tasked with finding the equation of demand for steel in the world market. The given information includes:\n\n- Last year's price was $20 per ton.\n- 100 million tons were sold at that price.\n- The own price elasticity of demand is -0.25.\n- The own price elasticity of supply is 0.5.\n- The market is competitive.\n\nWe need to derive the demand equation in the form P = f(Xd), where P is the price and Xd is the demand in millions of tons.\n\nStep 2: Recall the definition of price elasticity of demand and supply.\n\nThe price elasticity of demand (PED) is defined as the percentage change in quantity demanded in response to a 1% change in price. Mathematically, PED = (dXd/dP) * (P/Xd). Similarly, the price elasticity of supply (PES) is defined as (dXs/dP) * (P/Xs), where Xs is the supply.\n\nGiven PED = -0.25 and PES = 0.5, we can use these to find the demand and supply equations.\n\nStep 3: Use the given elasticities to set up the equations.\n\nSince the market is competitive, the equilibrium price and quantity are determined by the intersection of the demand and supply curves. Let's denote the demand function as P = f(Xd) and the supply function as P = g(Xs). At equilibrium, P = f(Xd) = g(Xs).\n\nWe can use the elasticities to relate the slopes of the demand and supply curves.\n\nStep 4: Express the elasticities in terms of the slopes of the demand and supply curves.\n\nFor demand, PED = -0.25 = (dXd/dP) * (P/Xd). Rearranging, dXd/dP = -0.25 * (Xd/P). Similarly, for supply, PES = 0.5 = (dXs/dP) * (P/Xs). Rearranging, dXs/dP = 0.5 * (Xs/P).\n\nStep 5: Use the fact that at equilibrium, P = f(Xd) = g(Xs). Since the market is competitive, the equilibrium price and quantity are the same for both demand and supply. Therefore, we can set f(Xd) = g(Xs) and solve for the demand equation.\n\nLet's denote the equilibrium price as P* and the equilibrium quantity as Xd*. Then, f(Xd*) = g(Xs*) = P*. Since the supply curve is linear, we can write g(Xs) = a + bXs, where a and b are constants. Since PES = 0.5, we have b = 0.5 * (Xs*/P*). Substituting this into g(Xs) = a + 0.5 * (Xs*/P*) * Xs.\n\nStep 6: Find the supply equation.\n\nSince the supply curve is linear, we can write g(Xs) = a + bXs. Given PES = 0.5, we have b = 0.5 * (Xs*/P*). Therefore, g(Xs) = a + 0.5 * (Xs*/P*) * Xs.\n\nStep 7: Find the demand equation.\n\nSince the demand curve is linear, we can write f(Xd) = c + dXd. Given PED = -0.25, we have d = -0.25 * (Xd*/P*). Therefore, f(Xd) = c - 0.25 * (Xd*/P*) * Xd.\n\nStep 8: Equate the demand and supply equations at equilibrium.\n\nAt equilibrium, f(Xd*) = g(Xs*) = P*. Therefore, c - 0.25 * (Xd*/P*) * Xd* = a + 0.5 * (Xs*/P*) * Xs*. Since Xd* = Xs*, we can substitute Xs* for Xd*. Therefore, c - 0.25 * (Xd*/P*) * Xd* = a + 0.5 * (Xd*/P*) * Xd*.\n\nStep 9: Solve for c.\n\nRearranging the equation, c - a = 0.25 * (Xd*/P*) * Xd* + 0.5 * (Xd*/P*) * Xd*. Combining like terms, c - a = (0.25 + 0.5) * (Xd*/P*) * Xd*. Therefore, c - a = 0.75 * (Xd*/P*) * Xd*. Since Xd* = Xs*, we can substitute Xs* for Xd*. Therefore, c - a = 0.75 * (Xs*/P*) * Xs*. Since P* = a + 0.5 * (Xs*/P*) * Xs*, we can substitute this into the equation. Therefore, c - a = 0.75 * (Xs*/(a + 0.5 * (Xs*/P*) * Xs*)) * Xs*. Simplifying, c - a = 0.75 * (Xs*/a) * Xs*.

  "Step 1: The problem involves a harmonic oscillator with an additional perturbation due to a constant electric field. The original potential energy is given by \\(V(x) = \\frac{1}{2} k x^2\\), and the energy levels and eigenstates are those of a harmonic oscillator. When a constant electric field \\(E_0\\) is applied, the potential energy becomes \\(V(x) = \\frac{1}{2} k x^2 + E_0 e x\\), where \\(e > 0\\). We need to find an expression for the energy levels \\(E_v\\) as a function of the strength of the electric field.\n\nStep 2: The original energy levels of the harmonic oscillator are given by \\(E_v = \\hbar \\omega (v + \\frac{1}{2})\\), where \\(\\omega = \\left[\\frac{k}{m_e}\\right]^{1/2}\\).

\\hat{a}^\\dagger + \\hat{a} | \\psi_v^{(0)} \\rangle\\right)\\).\n\nStep 13: Using the commutation relation \\([\\hat{a}, \\hat{a}^\\dagger] = 1\\), we can simplify the expression.\n\nStep 14: Since \\(\\hat{a}^\\dagger\\) and \\(\\hat{a}\\) are ladder operators, we have \\(\\hat{a}^\\dagger | v \\rangle = \\sqrt{v+1} | v+1 \\rangle\\) and \\(\\hat{a} | v \\rangle = \\sqrt{v} | v-1 \\rangle\\).\n\nStep 15: Therefore, the expectation value \\(\\langle \\psi_v^{(0)} | x | \\psi_v^{(0)} \\rangle\\) can be evaluated as \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar}{2m\\omega}} \\left(\\sqrt{v} \\langle v | \\hat{a} | v \\rangle + \\sqrt{v+1} \\langle v | \\hat{a}^\\dagger | v \\rangle\\right)\\).\n\nStep 16: Since \\(\\hat{a} | v \\rangle = \\sqrt{v} | v-1 \\rangle\\) and \\(\\hat{a}^\\dagger | v \\rangle = \\sqrt{v+1} | v+1 \\rangle\\), we have \\(\\langle v | \\hat{a} | v \\rangle = \\sqrt{v} \\langle v | v-1 \\rangle = 0\\) and \\(\\langle v | \\hat{a}^\\dagger | v \\rangle = \\sqrt{v+1} \\langle v | v+1 \\rangle = 0\\).\n\nStep 17: Therefore, the expectation value \\(\\langle \\psi_v^{(0)} | x | \\psi_v^{(0)} \\rangle\\) is zero for all \\(v\\).\n\nStep 18: Therefore, the new energy levels are given by \\(E_v^{(1)} = E_v^{(0)} + E_0 e \\langle \\psi_v^{(0)} | x | \\psi_v^{(0)} \\rangle = E_v^{(0)}\\).\n\nStep 19: Therefore, the energy levels remain unchanged under the perturbation.\n\nStep 20: Therefore, the energy levels of the harmonic oscillator subjected to a constant electric field are the same as the unperturbed energy levels.\n\nStep 21: Therefore, the

  "Step 1:  The problem requires us to find the energy difference between the $1 s^{2} 2 p_{x}^{2}$ configuration and the $1 s^{2} 2 s^{2}$ configuration using the independent particle model. To do this, we need to calculate the total energy for each configuration and then find the difference between them.\nStep 2:  First, let's recall that in the independent particle model, the total energy of an atom is given by the sum of the energies of each electron in the atom. The energy of an electron in a particular orbital is given by the sum of the Coulomb and exchange integrals for that orbital.\nStep 3:  The Coulomb integral, denoted as J, represents the energy due to the attraction between the electron and the nucleus, while the exchange integral, denoted as K, represents the energy due to the exchange of electrons between orbitals.\nStep 4:  The total energy of an electron in a particular orbital is given by the formula: E = J + K, where J is the Coulomb integral and K is the exchange integral.\nStep 5:  Therefore, to find the total energy of the $1 s^{2} 2 p_{x}^{2}$ configuration, we need to calculate the energies of the two 1s electrons and the two 2p electrons, and then sum them up.\nStep 6:  Similarly, for the $1 s^{2} 2 s^{2}$ configuration, we need to calculate the energies of the two 1s electrons and the two 2s electrons, and then sum them up.\nStep 7:  Once we have the total energies for both configurations, we can find the energy difference by subtracting the energy of the $1 s^{2} 2 s^{2}$ configuration from the energy of the $1 s^{2} 2 p_{x}^{2}$ configuration.\nStep 8:  Let's proceed with calculating the energies for each configuration.\n\nStep 9:  First, let's calculate the energy of the $1 s^{2} 2 p_{x}^{2}$ configuration.\n\nStep 10:  The energy of the two 1s electrons is given by 2 * (J_{1s1s} + K_{1s1s}) = 2 * (17.0 Z + 0) = 34.0 Z eV.\n\nStep 11:  The energy of the two 2p electrons is given by 2 * (J_{2p2p} + K_{2p2p}) = 2 * (3.9 Z + 0.2 Z) = 2 * (4.1 Z) = 8.2 Z eV.\n\nStep 12:  Therefore, the total energy of the $1 s^{2} 2 p_{x}^{2}$ configuration is 34.0 Z + 8.2 Z = 42.2 Z eV.\n\nStep 13:  Next, let's calculate the energy of the $1 s^{2} 2 s^{2}$ configuration.\n\nStep 14:  The energy of the two 1s electrons is given by 2 * (J_{1s1s} + K_{1s1s}) = 2 * (17.0 Z + 0) = 34.0 Z eV.\n\nStep 15:  The energy of the two 2s electrons is given by 2 * (J_{2s2s} + K_{2s2s}) = 2 * (3.5 Z + 0.8 Z) = 2 * (4.3 Z) = 8.6 Z eV.\n\nStep 16:  Therefore, the total energy of the $1 s^{2} 2 s^{2}$ configuration is 34.0 Z + 8.6 Z = 42.6 Z eV.\n\nStep 17:  Now, we can find the energy difference between the two configurations by subtracting the energy of the $1 s^{2} 2 s^{2}$ configuration from the energy of the $1 s^{2} 2 p_{x}^{2}$ configuration.\n\nStep 18:  Therefore, the energy difference is 42.2 Z - 42.6 Z = -0.4 Z eV.\n\nStep 19:  Therefore, the energy difference between the $1 s^{2} 2 p_{x}^{2}$ configuration and the $1 s^{2} 2 s^{2}$ configuration is -0.4 Z eV.\n\nStep 20:  Since the problem asks for the answer in eV, in terms of Z, and rounded to a single decimal place, the final answer is -0.4 Z eV.\n\nStep 21:  Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{-0.4 Z}",
  "Step 1: First, let's recall the formula to calculate the number of photons in a pulse of light. The number of photons (N) can be found using the formula:\n\nN = (E / (h * c)) * (1 / \u03bb)\n\nwhere:\n- E is the energy of the pulse in Joules (J)\n- h is Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 J s)\n- c is the speed of light (3.00 x 10^8 m/s)\n- \u03bb is the wavelength of the light in meters (m)\n\nStep 2: Convert the given energy from millijoules (mJ) to Joules (J). Since 1 mJ = 10^-3 J, we can convert 2.00 mJ to Joules as follows:\n\nE = 2.00 mJ = 2.00 * 10^-3 J\n\nStep 3: Convert the wavelength from micrometers (\u03bcm) to meters (m). Since 1 \u03bcm = 10^-6 m, we can convert 1.06 \u03bcm to meters as follows:\n\n\u03bb = 1.06 \u03bcm = 1.06 * 10^-6 m\n\nStep 4: Now, plug in the values into the formula:\n\nN = (E / (h * c)) * (1 / \u03bb)\n\nSubstitute E = 2.00 * 10^-3 J, h = 6.626 x 10^-34 J s, c = 3.00 x 10^8 m/s, and \u03bb = 1.06 * 10^-6 m into the formula.\n\nStep 5: Perform the calculation:\n\nN = (2.00 * 10^-3 J / (6.626 x 10^-34 J s * 3.00 x 10^8 m/s)) * (1 / (1.06 * 10^-6 m))\n\nFirst, calculate the denominator:\n\nh * c = 6.626 x 10^-34 J s * 3.00 x 10^8 m/s = 1.988 x 10^-25 J m\n\nThen, divide E by (h * c):\n\nE / (h * c) = 2.00 * 10^-3 J / (1.988 x 10^-25 J m) = 1.007 x 10^22 m^-1\n\nNext, multiply by (1 / \u03bb):\n\nN = (1.007 x 10^22 m^-1) * (1 / (1.06 * 10^-6 m)) = 1.007 x 10^22 m^-1 * 9.434 x 10^5 m^-1 = 9.52 x 10^26\n\nStep 6: Round the result to three significant figures.\n\nThe number of photons is approximately 9.52 x 10^26.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{9.52 x 10^26}",
  "Step 1: First, let's understand the problem. We are given that the work function of chromium is 4.40 eV, and we need to find the kinetic energy of electrons emitted from a clean chromium surface when it is irradiated with ultraviolet (UV) radiation of wavelength 200 nm. The goal is to calculate this kinetic energy in Joules.\n\nStep 2: To solve this problem, we can use the concept of the photoelectric effect, which states that when light is shone on a metal surface, electrons can be emitted from the surface if the energy of the photons is greater than the work function of the metal. The kinetic energy of the emitted electrons is the difference between the energy of the photons and the work function.\n\nStep 3: First, we need to convert the wavelength of the UV radiation from nanometers to meters. The wavelength is given as 200 nm, so we can convert it to meters by multiplying by 10^-9 m/nm. Therefore, the wavelength in meters is 200 * 10^-9 m = 2 * 10^-7 m.\n\nStep 4: Next, we need to calculate the energy of the photons. The energy of a photon is given by the formula E = hc / \u03bb, where h is Planck's constant (6.626 * 10^-34 J s), c is the speed of light (3 * 10^8 m/s), and \u03bb is the wavelength of the radiation. Plugging in the values, we get E = (6.626 * 10^-34 J s * 3 * 10^8 m/s) / (2 * 10^-7 m) = 9.939 * 10^-19 J.\n\nStep 5: However, the problem asks for the energy in eV. To convert the energy from Joules to eV, we can use the conversion factor 1 eV = 1.602 * 10^-19 J. Therefore, the energy in eV is (9.939 * 10^-19 J) / (1.602 * 10^-19 J/eV) = 6.21 eV.\n\nStep 6: The work function of chromium is given as 4.40 eV. Therefore, the kinetic energy of the electrons is the difference between the energy of the photons and the work function, which is 6.21 eV - 4.40 eV = 1.81 eV.\n\nStep 7: Finally, we need to convert the kinetic energy from eV to Joules. Using the conversion factor 1 eV = 1.602 * 10^-19 J, we can convert 1.81 eV to Joules: 1.81 eV * (1.602 * 10^-19 J/eV) = 2.90 * 10^-19 J.\n\nStep 8: Therefore, the kinetic energy of the electrons in Joules is 2.90 * 10^-19 J.\n\nStep 9: So, the final answer is \\boxed{2.90 * 10^-19}",

Given that the wavelength \\(\\lambda = 500 \\, \\text{nm} = 500 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\text{m}\\), we can substitute this into the formula to find \\(\\nu\\).\n\nStep 4: First, calculate the frequency \\(\\nu\\): \\(\\nu = \\frac{c}{\\lambda} = \\frac{3 \\times 10^{8} \\, \\text{m/s}}{500 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\text{m}} = \\frac{3 \\times 10^{8}}{500 \\times 10^{-9}} = \\frac{3 \\times 10^{8}}{5 \\times 10^{-7}} = 6 \\times 10^{14} \\, \\text{Hz}\\).\n\nStep 5: Now, calculate the energy of the photon: \\(E_{\\text {photon }} = h \\nu = (6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J s}) \\times (6 \\times 10^{14} \\, \\text{Hz}) = 3.9756 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J}\\).\n\nStep 6: Then, compute the momentum of the photon using the formula \\(p_{\\text {photon }} = \\frac{E_{\\text {photon }}}{c}\\): \\(p_{\\text {photon }} = \\frac{3.9756 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J}}{3 \\times 10^{8} \\, \\text{m/s}} = \\frac{3.9756 \\times 10^{-19}}{3 \\times 10^{8}} = 1.3222 \\times 10^{-27} \\, \\text{kg m/s}\\).\n\nStep 7: Finally, convert the momentum to kilogram meters per second by dividing by 1000: \\(1.3222 \\times 10^{-27} \\, \\text{kg m/s} \\div 1000 = 1.3222 \\times 10^{-30} \\, \\text{kg m/s}\\). However, the problem asks to express the answer in kilogram meters per second, rounding to three decimal places. Therefore, the answer is \\(1.322 \\times 10^{-30} \\, \\text{kg m/s}\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{1.322 x 10^-30}",

  "Step 1: First, let's recall the formula for the de Broglie wavelength, which is given by \u03bb = h / (m * v), where \u03bb is the wavelength, h is Planck's constant, m is the mass of the object, and v is its velocity.\n\nStep 2: We are given the mass of the baseball as 145 g. However, the mass needs to be in kilograms for the formula to work. So, we need to convert 145 g to kg. Since 1 kg = 1000 g, then 145 g = 0.145 kg.\n\nStep 3: The velocity of the baseball is given as 1 nm/s. However, the velocity needs to be in meters per second (m/s) for the formula to work. Since 1 nm = 10^-9 m, then 1 nm/s = 10^-9 m/s. Therefore, the velocity is 10^-9 m/s.\n\nStep 4: Planck's constant (h) is approximately 6.626 * 10^-34 J*s.\n\nStep 5: Now, we can plug in the values into the formula \u03bb = h / (m * v). So, \u03bb = (6.626 * 10^-34 J*s) / (0.145 kg * 10^-9 m/s).\n\nStep 6: First, calculate the denominator: 0.145 kg * 10^-9 m/s = 1.45 * 10^-12 kg*m/s.\n\nStep 7: Then, divide Planck's constant by this result: (6.626 * 10^-34 J*s) / (1.45 * 10^-12 kg*m/s).\n\nStep 8: To perform this division, we need to ensure that the units are compatible. Since 1 J = 1 kg*m^2/s^2, then 6.626 * 10^-34 J*s = 6.626 * 10^-34 kg*m^2/s^3. Therefore, the division is (6.626 * 10^-34 kg*m^2/s^3) / (1.45 * 10^-12 kg*m/s).\n\nStep 9: The units cancel out: kg*m^2/s^3 / (kg*m/s) = m^2/s^2 / s = m.\n\nStep 10: Now, perform the division: (6.626 * 10^-34) / (1.45 * 10^-12) = 4.57 * 10^-22 m.\n\nStep 11: Therefore, the de Broglie wavelength of the baseball is approximately 4.57 * 10^-22 m.\n\nStep 12: However, the question asks for the answer in meters, so the answer is already in meters.\n\nStep 13: Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{4.57 * 10^-22}",

  "Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem involves a particle in an infinite box, described by a superposition state wavefunction \u03c81,2. The wavefunction is a linear combination of two eigenstates \u03c81 and \u03c82, with coefficients (1/3)1/2 and (2/3)1/2, respectively. The task is to determine the possible results of measuring the energy of this superposition state.\n\nStep 2: Recall the properties of superposition states\nIn quantum mechanics, a superposition state is a linear combination of two or more eigenstates. When measuring the energy of a superposition state, the possible results are the eigenvalues of the individual eigenstates, weighted by the square of their coefficients.\n\nStep 3: Identify the eigenvalues of \u03c81 and \u03c82\nIn an infinite box, the energy eigenvalues are given by E_n = n^2 * hbar^2 / (8 * m * L^2), where n is a positive integer, hbar is the reduced Planck constant, m is the particle mass, and L is the box length.\n\nLet's assume that \u03c81 corresponds to n = 1 and \u03c82 corresponds to n = 2. Then, the eigenvalues are:\n\nE1 = 1^2 * hbar^2 / (8 * m * L^2) = hbar^2 / (8 * m * L^2)\n\nE2 = 2^2 * hbar^2 / (8 * m * L^2) = 4 * hbar^2 / (8 * m * L^2) = hbar^2 / (2 * m * L^2)\n\nStep 4: Calculate the possible results of measuring the energy\nWhen measuring the energy of \u03c81,2, the possible results are the eigenvalues E1 and E2, weighted by the square of their coefficients:\n\nP(E1) = |(1/3)1/2|^2 = 1/3\n\nP(E2) = |(2/3)1/2|^2 = 4/9\n\nTherefore, the possible results of measuring the energy are:\n\n1. E1 = hbar^2 / (8 * m * L^2) with probability 1/3\n2. E2 = hbar^2 / (2 * m * L^2) with probability 4/9\n\nAlternatively, the possible results can be expressed as:\n\n1. E1 = hbar^2 / (8 * m * L^2) with probability 1/3\n2. E2 = hbar^2 / (2 * m * L^2) with probability 4/9\n\nSo, the possible results are two distinct eigenvalues, each with a certain probability.\n\nStep 5: Write the final answer\nThe possible results of measuring the energy of \u03c81,2 are two distinct eigenvalues, E1 and E2, with probabilities 1/3 and 4/9, respectively.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{2}",

We need to round the result to one decimal place.\n\nStep 2: Identify the unperturbed Hamiltonian and the perturbation\nThe unperturbed Hamiltonian is the diagonal part of the matrix, which is:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{H}^{(0)}=\\hbar \\omega\\left(\\begin{array}{ccc}\n10 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & -10\n\\end{array}\\right)\n\\]\nThe perturbation is the off-diagonal part:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{H}^{(1)}=\\hbar \\omega\\left(\\begin{array}{ccc}\n0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 2 \\\\\n0 & 2 & 0\n\\end{array}\\right)\n\\]\n\nStep 3: Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the unperturbed Hamiltonian\nTo apply non-degenerate perturbation theory, we need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the unperturbed Hamiltonian. The unperturbed Hamiltonian is a 3x3 matrix with eigenvalues 10, 0, and -10. The corresponding eigenvectors are:\n\\[\n\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n1 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n0\n\\end{array}\\right), \\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n0 \\\\\n1 \\\\\n0\n\\end{array}\\right), \\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n0 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n1\n\\end{array}\\right)\n\\]\nThese eigenvectors are orthogonal to each other.\n\nStep 4: Apply non-degenerate perturbation theory\nNon-degenerate perturbation theory states that the energy of the nth state can be expanded as:\n\\[\nE_n^{(0)} + E_n^{(1)} + E_n^{(2)} + \\ldots\n\\]\nwhere E_n^{(0)} is the unperturbed energy, E_n^{(1)} is the first-order correction, and E_n^{(2)} is the second-order correction.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the first-order correction\nThe first-order correction is given by:\n\\[\nE_n^{(1)} = \\langle \\psi_n^{(0)} | \\mathbf{H}^{(1)} | \\psi_n^{(0)} \\rangle\n\\]\nwhere \\psi_n^{(0)} is the unperturbed eigenvector corresponding to the nth state.\n\nFor the \\widetilde{10} state, the unperturbed eigenvector is:\n\\[\n\\psi_{\\widetilde{10}}^{(0)} = \\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n1 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n0\n\\end{array}\\right)\n\\]\nThe first-order correction is:\n\\[\nE_{\\widetilde{10}}^{(1)} = \\langle \\psi_{\\widetilde{10}}^{(0)} | \\mathbf{H}^{(1)} | \\psi_{\\widetilde{10}}^{(0)} \\rangle = 0\n\\]\nbecause the first-order perturbation is zero.\n\nStep 6: Calculate the second-order correction\nThe second-order correction is given by:\n\\[\nE_n^{(2)} = \\sum_{m \\neq n} \\frac{|\\langle \\psi_m^{(0)} | \\mathbf{H}^{(1)} | \\psi_n^{(0)} \\rangle|^2}{E_n^{(0)} - E_m^{(0)}}\n\\]\nwhere the sum is over all states m that are different from n.\n\nFor the \\widetilde{10} state, the unperturbed energy is E_{\\widetilde{10}}^{(0)} = 10. The other two states have energies E_{\\widetilde{0}}^{(0)} = 0 and E_{-\\widetilde{10}}^{(0)} = -10.\n\nThe matrix elements of the first-order perturbation are:\n\\[\n\\langle \\psi_{\\widetilde{0}}^{(0)} | \\mathbf{H}^{(1)} | \\psi_{\\widetilde{10}}^{(0)} \\rangle = 1\n\\]\n\\[\n\\langle \\psi_{-\\widetilde{10}}^{(0)} | \\mathbf{H}^{(1)} | \\psi_{\\widetilde{10}}^{(0)} \\rangle = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n\\langle \\psi_{\\widetilde{0}}^{(0)} | \\mathbf{H}^{(1)} | \\psi_{\\widetilde{0}}^{(0)} \\rangle = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n\\langle \\psi_{-\\widetilde{10}}^{(0)} | \\mathbf{H}^{(1)} | \\psi_{\\widetilde{0}}^{(0)} \\rangle = 2\n\\]\n\\[\n\\langle \\psi_{\\widetilde{10}}^{(0)} | \\mathbf{H}^{(1)} | \\psi_{\\widetilde{0}}^{(0)} \\rangle = 1\n\\]\n\\[\n\\langle \\psi_{-\\widetilde{10}}^{(0)} | \\mathbf{H}^{(1)} | \\psi_{\\widetilde{10}}^{(0)} \\rangle = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n\\langle \\psi_{\\widetilde{0}}^{(0)} | \\mathbf{H}^{(1)} | \\psi_{-\\widetilde{10}}^{(0)} \\rangle = 2\n\\]\n\\[\n\\langle \\psi_{\\widetilde{10}}^{(0)} | \\mathbf{H}^{(1)} | \\psi_{-\\widetilde{10}}^{(0)} \\rangle = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n\\langle \\psi_{-\\widetilde{10}}^{(0)} | \\mathbf{H}^{(1)} | \\psi_{-\\widetilde{10}}^{(0)} \\rangle = 0\n\\]\n\nThe second-order correction is:\n\\[\nE_{\\widetilde{10}}^{(2)} = \\frac{|\\langle \\psi_{\\widetilde{0}}^{(0)} | \\mathbf{H}^{(1)} | \\psi_{\\widetilde{10}}^{(0)} \\rangle|^2}{E_{\\widetilde{10}}^{(0)} - E_{\\widetilde{0}}^{(0)}} + \\frac{|\\langle \\psi_{-\\widetilde{10}}^{(0)} | \\mathbf{H}^{(1)} | \\psi_{\\widetilde{10}}^{(0)} \\rangle|^2}{E_{\\widetilde{10}}^{(0)} - E_{-\\widetilde{10}}^{(0)}}\n\\]\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\\[\nE_{\\widetilde{10}}^{(2)} = \\frac{1^2}{10 - 0} + \\frac{0^2}{10 - (-10)} = \\frac{1}{10} + 0 = \\frac{1}{10}\n\\]\n\nStep 7: Calculate the total energy\nThe total energy is the sum of the unperturbed energy and the first-order and second-order corrections:\n\\[\nE_{\\widetilde{10}} = E_{\\widetilde{10}}^{(0)} + E_{\\widetilde{10}}^{(1)} + E_{\\widetilde{10}}^{(2)} = 10 + 0 + \\frac{1}{10} = 10 + 0.1 = 10.1\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the energy of the \\widetilde{10} state is 10.1.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{10.1}"
