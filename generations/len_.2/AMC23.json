  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the distance between Alicia and Beth when they meet. Since they are biking towards each other, we can use the concept of relative motion to find their combined speed and the time it takes for them to meet.\nStep 2:  First, we need to find the combined speed of Alicia and Beth. Alicia bikes at 18 miles per hour, and Beth bikes at 12 miles per hour. When they are moving towards each other, their speeds add up, so their combined speed is $18 + 12 = 30$ miles per hour.\nStep 3:  Next, we need to find the time it takes for them to meet. Since they are 45 miles apart, and their combined speed is 30 miles per hour, we can use the formula $time = \\frac{distance}{speed}$ to find the time it takes for them to meet. So, the time it takes for them to meet is $\\frac{45}{30} = 1.5$ hours.\nStep 4:  Now that we have the time it takes for them to meet, we can find the distance they will be from City A when they meet. Since Alicia bikes at 18 miles per hour, in 1.5 hours, she will have traveled $18 \\times 1.5 = 27$ miles. Similarly, Beth bikes at 12 miles per hour, so in 1.5 hours, she will have traveled $12 \\times 1.5 = 18$ miles.\nStep 5:  Therefore, when they meet, Alicia will be 27 miles from City A, and Beth will be 18 miles from City A. Since they are biking towards each other, the distance between them when they meet will be the sum of the distances they have traveled, which is $27 + 18 = 45$ miles.\nStep 6:  However, this is the total distance between them, not the distance from City A. Since they are biking towards each other, the distance from City A will be the distance traveled by Alicia, which is 27 miles.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{27}$",
  "Problem: Positive real numbers $x$ and $y$ satisfy $y^3=x^2$ and $(y-x)^2=4y^2$. What is $x+y$?\nStep 1:  We are given two equations involving positive real numbers $x$ and $y$: $y^3=x^2$ and $(y-x)^2=4y^2$.\nStep 2:  The first equation, $y^3=x^2$, can be rewritten as $x^2=y^3$, indicating that $x^2$ is the cube of $y$.\nStep 3:  The second equation, $(y-x)^2=4y^2$, can be expanded to $y^2-2xy+x^2=4y^2$, which simplifies to $x^2-2xy=3y^2$.\nStep 4:  We can then substitute $x^2=y^3$ into the second equation, giving us $y^3-2xy=3y^2$.\nStep 5:  Rearranging the terms, we get $y^3-3y^2=2xy$, which can be factored as $y^2(y-3)=2xy$.\nStep 6:  Since $y$ is a positive real number, we can divide both sides by $y$ to obtain $y(y-3)=2x$.\nStep 7:  We can then substitute $x^2=y^3$ into the equation $y(y-3)=2x$, giving us $y(y-3)=2y^{\\frac{3}{2}}$.\nStep 8:  Simplifying, we get $y^2-3y=2y^{\\frac{3}{2}}$.\nStep 9:  Rearranging the terms, we have $y^2-2y^{\\frac{3}{2}}-3y=0$.\nStep 10:  Factoring out $y$, we get $y(y-2\\sqrt{y}-3)=0$.\nStep 11:  Since $y$ is a positive real number, we can divide both sides by $y$ to obtain $y-2\\sqrt{y}-3=0$.\nStep 12:  Rearranging the terms, we have $y-3=2\\sqrt{y}$.\nStep 13:  Squaring both sides, we get $(y-3)^2=4y$.\nStep 14:  Expanding the left-hand side, we have $y^2-6y+9=4y$.\nStep 15:  Rearranging the terms, we get $y^2-10y+9=0$.\nStep 16:  Factoring the quadratic equation, we have $(y-1)(y-9)=0$.\nStep 17:  Since $y$ is a positive real number, we can discard the solution $y=9$ and take $y=1$.\nStep 18:  Substituting $y=1$ into the equation $x^2=y^3$, we get $x^2=1^3$, which simplifies to $x^2=1$.\nStep 19:  Taking the square root of both sides, we get $x=\\pm 1$.\nStep 20:  Since $x$ is a positive real number, we take $x=1$.\nStep 21:  Therefore, the sum of $x$ and $y$ is $x+y=1+1=2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given information and use logical reasoning to deduce the total number of games played in the table tennis tournament.\nStep 2:  Let's assume that there are $L$ left-handed players and $R$ right-handed players. We are given that there are twice as many right-handed players as left-handed players, so we can express this as $R = 2L$.\nStep 3:  The total number of games played can be calculated using the formula $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$, where $n$ is the total number of players.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the sequence of jumps that Flora the frog makes and the probability associated with each jump.\nStep 2:  Flora starts at 0 on the number line and makes a sequence of jumps to the right. In any one jump, independent of previous jumps, Flora leaps a positive integer distance $m$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2^m}$.\nStep 3:  We are interested in finding the probability that Flora will eventually land at 10. This means we need to consider all possible sequences of jumps that result in Flora reaching 10.\nStep 4:  To approach this, we can use the concept of a generating function, which encodes the probability of reaching a particular position after a certain number of jumps.\nStep 5:  The generating function for this problem is given by $f(x) = \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2^m} x^m$. This function represents the probability of reaching a position $x$ after a certain number of jumps.\nStep 6:  We are interested in finding the probability that Flora will eventually land at 10, which means we need to find the coefficient of $x^{10}$ in the expansion of $f(x)$.\nStep 7:  To do this, we can use the binomial theorem to expand $f(x)$ and then find the coefficient of $x^{10}$.\nStep 8:  The binomial theorem states that $(1 + x)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} x^k$. We can use this theorem to expand $f(x)$ and find the coefficient of $x^{10}$.\nStep 9:  After expanding $f(x)$ using the binomial theorem, we can find the coefficient of $x^{10}$, which represents the probability that Flora will eventually land at 10.\nStep 10:  Once we have the coefficient of $x^{10}$, we can simplify it to obtain the probability as a fraction $\\frac{m}{n}$.\nStep 11:  Finally, we need to find $m+n$ to obtain the final answer.\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability that Flora will eventually land at 10.\n\nThe generating function for this problem is given by $f(x) = \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2^m} x^m$.

First, let's multiply the entire equation by 24 to clear the fractions: $8p + 21 = 18p + 3$.\nStep 9:  Next, let's move all the terms involving $p$ to one side of the equation: $8p - 18p = 3 - 21$.\nStep 10:  Simplifying, we get: $-10p = -18$.\nStep 11:  Finally, solving for $p$, we divide both sides by $-10$: $p = \\frac{-18}{-10} = \\frac{9}{5}$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the weight of a large pizza is $\\frac{9}{5}$ pounds.\nStep 13:  The answer can be written in the form $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. In this case, $m = 9$ and $n = 5$, so $m - n = 9 - 5 = 4$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve for $f(2023)$, we need to understand the given functional equation and find a way to express $f(n)$ in terms of $n$.\nStep 2:  The functional equation provided is $\\sum_{d\\mid n}d\\cdot f\\left(\\frac{n}{d}\\right)=1$ for all positive integers $n$.\nStep 3:  We are given that $f(1) = 1$, which is a crucial piece of information to start solving the problem.\nStep 4:  We can use the functional equation to find $f(2)$ by substituting $n = 2$ into the equation. This gives us $1 \\cdot f(2) + 2 \\cdot f(1) = 1$, which simplifies to $f(2) + 2 = 1$, leading to $f(2) = -1$.\nStep 5:  Next, we substitute $n = 4$ into the functional equation to find $f(4)$. This gives us $1 \\cdot f(4) + 2 \\cdot f(2) + 4 \\cdot f(1) = 1$, which simplifies to $f(4) + 2(-1) + 4 = 1$, leading to $f(4) = 1 - 2 - 4 = -5$.\nStep 6:  We can continue this process to find $f(8)$ by substituting $n = 8$ into the functional equation. This gives us $1 \\cdot f(8) + 2 \\cdot f(4) + 4 \\cdot f(2) + 8 \\cdot f(1) = 1$, which simplifies to $f(8) + 2(-5) + 4(-1) + 8 = 1$, leading to $f(8) = 1 - 10 - 4 + 8 = -5$.\nStep 7:  We can see a pattern emerging where $f(2^n) = -5$ for all positive integers $n$.\nStep 8:  Now, we need to find $f(2023)$. Since $2023 = 7 \\cdot 17 \\cdot 17$, we can express $2023$ as a product of prime powers.\nStep 9:  We can use the functional equation to find $f(2023)$ by substituting $n = 2023$ into the equation.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the number of sequences $A_1$, $A_2$, $\\dots$, $A_n$ that satisfy the given conditions and then find the remainder when this number is divided by $10$.\nStep 2:  The problem states that each $A_i$ is a subset of $\\{1, 2, 3, \\dots, 10\\}$, and $A_{i-1}$ is a subset of $A_i$ for each $i$ between $2$ and $n$, inclusive. This means that each $A_i$ can be any subset of the set $\\{1, 2, 3, \\dots, 10\\}$, and each subsequent subset $A_i$ must contain all the elements of the previous subset $A_{i-1}$.\nStep 3:  We can approach this problem by considering the number of ways to choose the subsets $A_i$ for each $i$ from $1$ to $n$.

Since she rolls the die 4 times, we need to consider the possible outcomes of each roll and how they contribute to the running total.\nStep 3:  The running total can equal 3 in the following ways: (1) if the first roll is 3, (2) if the first two rolls sum to 3, (3) if the first three rolls sum to 3, or (4) if the first four rolls sum to 3.\nStep 4:  We need to calculate the probability of each of these cases and then sum them up to find the overall probability.\nStep 5:  Case 1: If the first roll is 3, the probability is $\\frac{1}{6}$, as there is only one favorable outcome (rolling a 3) out of 6 possible outcomes.\nStep 6:  Case 2: If the first two rolls sum to 3, the probability is $\\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{36}$, as there is only one favorable outcome (rolling a 1 and then a 2, or rolling a 2 and then a 1) out of 36 possible outcomes.\nStep 7:  Case 3: If the first three rolls sum to 3, the probability is $\\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{216}$, as there is only one favorable outcome (rolling a 1, then a 1, and then a 1) out of 216 possible outcomes.\nStep 8:  Case 4: If the first four rolls sum to 3, the probability is $\\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{1296}$, as there is only one favorable outcome (rolling a 1, then a 1, then a 1, and then a 1) out of 1296 possible outcomes.\nStep 9:  Now, we need to sum up the probabilities of these cases to find the overall probability.\nStep 10:  The overall probability is $\\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{36} + \\frac{1}{216} + \\frac{1}{1296}$.\nStep 11:  To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 1296.\nStep 12:  Converting each fraction to have a denominator of 1296, we get $\\frac{216}{1296} + \\frac{36}{1296} + \\frac{6}{1296} + \\frac{1}{1296}$.\nStep 13:  Adding these fractions, we get $\\frac{259}{1296}$.\nStep 14:  Therefore, the probability that Janet's running total will equal 3 at some point during her 4 rolls is $\\frac{259}{1296}$.\nStep 15:  The final answer can be written in the form $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.

  "Step 1:  The problem involves finding the positive difference between the x-coordinates of points A and B, which lie on the graph of y = log2(x). The midpoint of the line segment AB is given as (6, 2).\nStep 2:  To start, we need to understand the relationship between the coordinates of points A and B and the midpoint. The midpoint formula states that the coordinates of the midpoint of a line segment with endpoints (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2).\nStep 3:  Given that the midpoint is (6, 2), we can use the midpoint formula to express the coordinates of A and B as (a, log2(a)) and (b, log2(b)), respectively.\nStep 4:  Substituting the midpoint coordinates into the midpoint formula, we get ((a + b)/2, (log2(a) + log2(b))/2) = (6, 2).\nStep 5:  From this, we can equate the x-coordinates to get (a + b)/2 = 6, which simplifies to a + b = 12.\nStep 6:  Similarly, equating the y-coordinates gives (log2(a) + log2(b))/2 = 2, which simplifies to log2(a) + log2(b) = 4.\nStep 7:  Using the properties of logarithms, we can rewrite log2(a) + log2(b) as log2(ab) = 4, which implies ab = 2^4 = 16.\nStep 8:  Now, we have the system of equations a + b = 12 and ab = 16. We can solve this system to find the values of a and b.\nStep 9:  Solving the system of equations, we find that a = 8 and b = 4, or a = 4 and b = 8.\nStep 10:  The positive difference between the x-coordinates of A and B is |a - b|, which is |8 - 4| = 4, or |4 - 8| = 4.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the positive difference between the x-coordinates of A and B is 4.\nStep 12:  The final answer is: \\boxed{4}",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the situation. Mrs. Jones has four identical glasses, and she fills the first three glasses completely but only fills the fourth glass $\\frac{1}{3}$ full. This means that the total amount of juice in the first three glasses is equal to the amount in the fourth glass plus the amount that needs to be distributed to make all four glasses equal.\nStep 2:  Let's assume that the amount of juice in each of the first three glasses is $x$. Then, the total amount of juice in these three glasses is $3x$. The fourth glass has $\\frac{1}{3}$ full, which is $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the total capacity of a glass. So, the total amount of juice in all four glasses is $3x + \\frac{1}{3}$.\nStep 3:  To make all four glasses have the same amount of juice, we need to distribute the juice from the first three glasses to the fourth glass. Let's say Mrs. Jones pours $a$ amount of juice from each of the first three glasses into the fourth glass. Then, the amount of juice in the fourth glass becomes $\\frac{1}{3} + 3a$.\nStep 4:  Since all four glasses should have the same amount of juice, the amount in the first three glasses should also be equal to $\\frac{1}{3} + 3a$. Therefore, we have the equation $x = \\frac{1}{3} + 3a$.\nStep 5:  We also know that the total amount of juice in all four glasses is $3x + \\frac{1}{3}$. Since all four glasses have the same amount of juice, the total amount is $4 \\times (\\frac{1}{3} + 3a)$. Equating these two expressions gives us the equation $3x + \\frac{1}{3} = 4(\\frac{1}{3} + 3a)$.\nStep 6:  Solving this equation will give us the value of $a$, which represents the fraction of a glass that Mrs. Jones needs to pour from each of the first three glasses into the fourth glass.\nStep 7:  Once we find the value of $a$, we can express it as a fraction $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. The final answer will be $m + n$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the points of intersection between the two circles and then determine the slope of the line passing through these points.\nStep 2:  The first circle has a radius of $4$ and is tangent to the $y$-axis at the origin. This means its center lies on the positive $x$-axis, and its equation is of the form $(x - a)^2 + y^2 = 4^2$, where $a$ is the $x$-coordinate of the center.\nStep 3:  Since the circle is tangent to the $y$-axis, the distance from the center to the $y$-axis is $4$, so the $x$-coordinate of the center is $4$. Therefore, the equation of the first circle is $(x - 4)^2 + y^2 = 16$.\nStep 4:  The second circle has a radius of $10$ and is tangent to the $x$-axis at the origin. This means its center lies on the positive $y$-axis, and its equation is of the form $x^2 + (y - b)^2 = 10^2$, where $b$ is the $y$-coordinate of the center.\nStep 5:  Since the circle is tangent to the $x$-axis, the distance from the center to the $x$-axis is $10$, so the $y$-coordinate of the center is $10$. Therefore, the equation of the second circle is $x^2 + (y - 10)^2 = 100$.\nStep 6:  To find the points of intersection, we need to solve the system of equations formed by the two circle equations.\nStep 7:  We can solve this system by substituting the expression for $y$ from the first equation into the second equation, or by using the fact that the circles are tangent to the axes and the origin.\nStep 8:  Since the circles are tangent to the axes, the points of intersection must lie on the line $y = x$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, we can substitute $y = x$ into the equation of the first circle to get $(x - 4)^2 + x^2 = 16$.\nStep 10:  Simplifying this equation, we get $2x^2 - 8x + 16 = 0$.\nStep 11:  Solving this quadratic equation, we find that $x = 2$ or $x = 6$.\nStep 12:  Since the circles are tangent to the axes, the points of intersection must lie on the line $y = x$, so the $y$-coordinate of the points of intersection is also $2$ or $6$.\nStep 13:  Therefore, the points of intersection are $(2, 2)$ and $(6, 6)$.\nStep 14:  The slope of the line passing through these points is given by $\\frac{6 - 2}{6 - 2} = \\frac{4}{4} = 1$.\nStep 15:  Therefore, the slope of the line passing through the two points of intersection is $1$.\nStep 16:  The final answer is: $\\boxed{1+1=2}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum area of an isosceles trapezoid with legs of length $1$ and one base twice as long as the other.\nStep 2:  Let's denote the length of the shorter base as $x$. Then, the length of the longer base is $2x$. The height of the trapezoid is denoted as $h$.\nStep 3:  We can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate the height $h$ with the length of the legs and the bases. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\nStep 4:  In this case, we have a right-angled triangle formed by the height $h$, half the difference between the bases ($2x - x = x$), and the leg of length $1$. So, we have $h^2 + \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^2 = 1^2$.\nStep 5:  Solving for $h$, we get $h = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{x^2}{4}}$.\nStep 6:  The area of the trapezoid is given by the formula $A = \\frac{1}{2}(b_1 + b_2)h$, where $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the lengths of the bases and $h$ is the height.\nStep 7:  Substituting the values, we get $A = \\frac{1}{2}(x + 2x)\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{x^2}{4}} = \\frac{3x}{2}\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{x^2}{4}}$.\nStep 8:  To find the maximum area, we need to maximize the expression $A = \\frac{3x}{2}\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{x^2}{4}}$.\nStep 9:  We can do this by finding the critical points of the function and then determining the maximum value.\nStep 10:  To find the critical points, we take the derivative of the function with respect to $x$ and set it equal to zero.\nStep 11:  After finding the critical points, we can use the second derivative test to determine whether the critical points correspond to a maximum or minimum.\nStep 12:  Once we have the maximum area, we can express it in the form $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.\nStep 13:  Finally, we need to find $m^2 + n^2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{57}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given binary operation $\\otimes$ and how it applies to complex numbers.\nStep 2:  The operation $u \\otimes v = ac + bdi$ is defined for complex numbers $u = a+bi$ and $v = c+di$. Here, $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are real numbers, and $i$ is the imaginary unit, where $i^2 = -1$.\nStep 3:  We are given that $z$ is a complex number such that $z\\otimes z = z^{2}+40$. We need to find the value of $|z|^2$.\nStep 4:  Let's represent $z$ as $a+bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers. Then, $z\\otimes z$ can be calculated using the given operation.\nStep 5:  Substituting $z = a+bi$ into the operation, we get $z\\otimes z = (a+bi)\\otimes (a+bi) = a^2 + b^2i^2 + 2abi$.\nStep 6:  Simplifying this expression, we get $z\\otimes z = a^2 - b^2 + 2abi$.\nStep 7:  We are given that $z\\otimes z = z^{2}+40$. So, we can equate the two expressions: $a^2 - b^2 + 2abi = (a+bi)^2 + 40$.\nStep 8:  Expanding the right-hand side, we get $a^2 - b^2 + 2abi = a^2 + 2abi + b^2i^2 + 40$.\nStep 9:  Simplifying this expression, we get $a^2 - b^2 + 2abi = a^2 + 2abi - b^2 + 40$.\nStep 10:  Equating the real and imaginary parts, we get two equations: $a^2 - b^2 = a^2 - b^2 + 40$ and $2ab = 2ab$.\nStep 11:  From the first equation, we can see that $40 = 0$, which is not possible.

  "Problem: For how many ordered pairs $(a,b)$ of integers does the polynomial $x^3+ax^2+bx+6$ have $3$ distinct integer roots?\nStep 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ordered pairs $(a,b)$ of integers for which the polynomial $x^3+ax^2+bx+6$ has $3$ distinct integer roots.\nStep 2:  We can start by considering the properties of the roots of a polynomial. If a polynomial has $3$ distinct integer roots, then the product of these roots must be equal to the constant term of the polynomial, which is $6$ in this case.\nStep 3:  The constant term $6$ can be expressed as the product of three distinct integers in the following ways: $1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3$, $1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 6$, $1 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 6$, and $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 6$.\nStep 4:  However, we need to consider the Vieta's formulas, which state that the sum of the roots of a polynomial is equal to the negation of the coefficient of the second-highest degree term, and the product of the roots is equal to the constant term.\nStep 5:  For the polynomial $x^3+ax^2+bx+6$, the sum of the roots is $-a$, and the product of the roots is $6$.\nStep 6:  Since the roots are distinct integers, we can express the sum of the roots as $-a = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6$, $-a = 1 + 2 + 6 = 9$, $-a = 1 + 3 + 6 = 10$, and $-a = 2 + 3 + 6 = 11$.\nStep 7:  However, we need to consider the fact that the roots are distinct integers, so the sum of the roots cannot be equal to $6$ or $9$ or $10$ or $11$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the only possible sum of the roots is $-a = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6$, which implies that the roots are $1, 2, 3$.\nStep 9:  However, we need to consider the fact that the roots are distinct integers, so the roots cannot be $1, 2, 3$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the only possible sum of the roots is $-a =

Jackson has a paintbrush that creates a narrow strip with a width of $6.5$ millimeters. He has enough paint to make a strip that is $25$ meters long. We need to find out how many square centimeters of paper Jackson could cover with paint.\nStep 2:  To solve this problem, we need to convert the length of the strip from meters to millimeters, as the width is given in millimeters. We know that $1$ meter is equal to $1000$ millimeters, so $25$ meters is equal to $25 \\times 1000 = 25000$ millimeters.\nStep 3:  Now, we need to find the area of the strip, which is the product of its length and width. The length of the strip is $25000$ millimeters, and the width is $6.5$ millimeters. So, the area of the strip is $25000 \\times 6.5 = 162500$ square millimeters.\nStep 4:  However, the question asks for the area in square centimeters. We know that $1$ centimeter is equal to $10$ millimeters, so $1$ square centimeter is equal to $10 \\times 10 = 100$ square millimeters. Therefore, to convert the area from square millimeters to square centimeters, we divide by $100$. So, the area in square centimeters is $162500 \\div 100 = 1625$ square centimeters.\nStep 5:  Therefore, Jackson could cover $1625$ square centimeters of paper with paint.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1625}$",

The goal is to find at least one square that is covered by the rectangle in the minimum number of turns.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the grid and rectangle\nThe $3 \\times 3$ grid has 9 squares, and the $2 \\times 1$ rectangle covers two adjacent squares. Since the rectangle is $2 \\times 1$, it can cover two adjacent squares horizontally or vertically.\n\nStep 3: Determine the possible positions of the rectangle\nThe rectangle can cover two adjacent squares in the following ways:\n- Horizontally: (1,1) and (1,2), (2,1) and (2,2), (3,1) and (3,2)\n- Vertically: (1,1) and (2,1), (1,2) and (2,2), (1,3) and (2,3)\n\nStep 4: Consider the worst-case scenario\nIn the worst-case scenario, the rectangle covers two squares that are not adjacent to each other. This means that the rectangle could cover (1,1) and (3,1), (1,1) and (3,2), (1,1) and (3,3), (1,2) and (3,2), (1,2) and (3,3), (1,3) and (3,3), (2,1) and (3,1), (2,1) and (3,2), (2,1) and (3,3), (2,2) and (3,2), (2,2) and (3,3), (2,3) and (3,3).\n\nStep 5: Determine the minimum number of turns\nTo guarantee that at least one square is covered, we need to consider the worst-case scenario. In the worst-case scenario, the rectangle covers two non-adjacent squares. We need to find a strategy to guarantee that at least one square is covered in the minimum number of turns.\n\nStep 6: Develop a strategy\nOne possible strategy is to guess the center square first. If the center square is covered, then we know that the rectangle covers two adjacent squares. If the center square is not covered, then we can guess two adjacent squares to the center square. If neither of these squares is covered, then we can guess two adjacent squares to one of the previously guessed squares.\n\nStep 7: Analyze the strategy\nLet's analyze the strategy:\n- Guess the center square (1,2). If it's covered, then we know the rectangle covers two adjacent squares.\n- If the center square is not covered, guess two adjacent squares to the center square: (1,1) and (1,3), (2,1) and (2,3), (3,1) and (3,3). If neither of these squares is covered, then we can guess two adjacent squares to one of the previously guessed squares.\n\nStep 8: Determine the minimum number of turns\nBased on the strategy, we can see that we need at least 3 turns to guarantee that at least one square is covered:\n- Turn 1: Guess the center square (1,2).\n- Turn 2: Guess two adjacent squares to the center square.\n- Turn 3: Guess two adjacent squares to one of the previously guessed squares.\n\nStep 9: Consider the worst-case scenario\nIn the worst-case scenario, the rectangle covers two non-adjacent squares.

  "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are given a polynomial $P(x)$ with roots at $x = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 10$. The polynomial is expressed as the product of linear factors, each raised to a power equal to its root's position in the sequence. We need to determine how many of the open intervals formed by removing the roots from the number line have $P(x)$ positive.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the intervals\nThe roots of the polynomial are at $x = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 10$. When these roots are removed from the number line, we are left with $11$ disjoint open intervals. These intervals are $(0, 1)$, $(1, 2)$, $(2, 3)$, $\\ldots$, $(9, 10)$, and $(10, \\infty)$.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the sign of P(x) in each interval\nTo determine the sign of $P(x)$ in each interval, we need to consider the product of the linear factors in each interval. Since the polynomial is expressed as the product of linear factors, the sign of $P(x)$ in each interval will be determined by the signs of the factors in that interval.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the sign of each factor in each interval\nFor each interval, we need to determine the sign of each factor in that interval. Since the factors are linear, the sign of each factor will be determined by the sign of the coefficient and the sign of the root. For example, in the interval $(1, 2)$, the factor $(x-1)$ will be positive, and the factor $(x-2)$ will be negative.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the sign of P(x) in each interval\nBy analyzing the signs of the factors in each interval, we can determine the sign of $P(x)$ in each interval. Since the polynomial is the product of the factors, the sign of $P(x)$ will be the product of the signs of the factors.\n\n## Step 6: Count the intervals with P(x) positive\nWe need to count the number of intervals where $P(x)$ is positive. Since $P(x)$ is the product of the factors, $P(x)$ will be positive if an even number of factors are negative in each interval.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze the factors in each interval\nIn the interval $(0, 1)$, the factor $(x-1)$ will be positive, and the factor $(x-2)$ will be positive. In the interval $(1, 2)$, the factor $(x-1)$ will be positive, and the factor $(x-2)$ will be negative. In the interval $(2, 3)$, the factor $(x-2)$ will be positive, and the factor $(x-3)$ will be negative. In the interval $(3, 4)$, the factor $(x-3)$ will be positive, and the factor $(x-4)$ will be negative. In the interval $(4, 5)$, the factor $(x-4)$ will be positive, and the factor $(x-5)$ will be negative. In the interval $(5, 6)$, the factor $(x-5)$ will be positive, and the factor $(x-6)$ will be negative. In the interval $(6, 7)$, the factor $(x-6)$ will be positive, and the factor $(x-7)$ will be negative. In the interval $(7, 8)$, the factor $(x-7)$ will be positive, and the factor $(x-8)$ will be negative. In the interval $(8, 9)$, the factor $(x-8)$ will be positive, and the factor $(x-9)$ will be negative. In the interval $(9, 10)$, the factor $(x-9)$ will be positive, and the factor $(x-10)$ will be negative. In the interval $(10, \\infty)$, the factor $(x-10)$ will be positive.\n\n## Step 8: Determine the sign of P(x) in each interval\nIn the interval $(0, 1)$, $P(x)$ will be positive since both factors are positive. In the interval $(1, 2)$, $P(x)$ will be negative since one factor is negative. In the interval $(2, 3)$, $P(x)$ will be negative since one factor is negative. In the interval $(3, 4)$, $P(x)$ will be negative since one factor is negative. In the interval $(4, 5)$, $P(x)$ will be negative since one factor is negative. In the interval $(5, 6)$, $P(x)$ will be negative since one factor is negative. In the interval $(6, 7)$, $P(x)$ will be negative since one factor is negative. In the interval $(7, 8)$, $P(x)$ will be negative since one factor is negative. In the interval $(8, 9)$, $P(x)$ will be negative since one factor is negative. In the interval $(9, 10)$, $P(x)$ will be negative since one factor is negative. In the interval $(10, \\infty)$, $P(x)$ will be positive since all factors are positive.\n\n## Step 9: Count the intervals with P(x) positive\nWe have determined the sign of $P(x)$ in each interval. We need to count the number of intervals where $P(x)$ is positive. In the intervals $(0, 1)$ and $(10, \\infty)$, $P(x)$ is positive. Therefore, there are 2 intervals where $P(x)$ is positive.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the values of $n$ for which the given expression represents a real number.\nStep 2:  The expression involves logarithms and square roots, so we need to carefully analyze each part of the expression to determine the conditions under which it is real.\nStep 3:  We start by simplifying the expression step by step to make it easier to work with.\nStep 4:  The expression is $\\sqrt{\\frac{\\log (n^2) - (\\log n)^2}{\\log n - 3}}$. We can simplify the numerator using the property of logarithms that $\\log (n^2) = 2 \\log n$.\nStep 5:  So, the expression becomes $\\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\log n - (\\log n)^2}{\\log n - 3}}$.\nStep 6:  Next, we can simplify the numerator further by factoring out $\\log n$ from the first two terms, giving us $\\sqrt{\\frac{\\log n (2 - \\log n)}{\\log n - 3}}$.\nStep 7:  We can then cancel out the $\\log n$ from the numerator and denominator, leaving us with $\\sqrt{\\frac{2 - \\log n}{\\log n - 3}}$.\nStep 8:  Now, we need to determine the conditions under which this expression is real. For the expression to be real, the denominator must be non-zero, and the numerator must be non-negative.\nStep 9:  The denominator is $\\log n - 3$, so it must be non-zero, which means $\\log n \\neq 3$. This implies that $n \\neq 10^3 = 1000$.\nStep 10:  The numerator is $2 - \\log n$, so it must be non-negative, which means $2 - \\log n \\ge 0$. This implies that $\\log n \\le 2$, which means $n \\le 10^2 = 100$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the expression is real for $n \\le 100$ and $n \\neq 1000$.\nStep 12:  However, we also need to consider the case where the denominator is zero, which means $\\log n = 3$. This implies that $n = 10^3 = 1000$, which is not allowed.\nStep 13:  Therefore, the expression is real for $n \\le 100$ and $n \\neq 1000$.\nStep 14:  Now, we need to count the number of integers $n$ that satisfy these conditions.\nStep 15:  The integers $n$ that satisfy $n \\le 100$ are $1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 100$.\nStep 16:  However, we need to exclude $n = 1000$, which is not allowed.\nStep 17:  Therefore, the number of integers $n$ that satisfy the conditions is $100 - 1 = 99$.\nStep 18:  However, we also need to consider the case where $n = 1$, which makes the denominator zero.\nStep 19:  Therefore, we need to exclude $n = 1$ as well.\nStep 20:  Therefore, the number of integers $n$ that satisfy the conditions is $99 - 1 = 98$.\nStep 21:  Therefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{98}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{98}$",
  "Problem: How many nonempty subsets $B$ of ${0, 1, 2, 3, \\cdots, 12}$ have the property that the number of elements in $B$ is equal to the least element of $B$? For example, $B = {4, 6, 8, 11}$ satisfies the condition.\nStep 1:  The problem asks us to find the number of nonempty subsets $B$ of the set ${0, 1, 2, 3, \\cdots, 12}$ such that the number of elements in $B$ is equal to the least element of $B$.\nStep 2:  To approach this problem, we need to consider the possible sizes of subsets and the corresponding least elements.\nStep 3:  We can start by considering the subsets of size $1$. In this case, the least element of the subset is $1$, and there are $12$ subsets of size $1$.\nStep 4:  Moving on to subsets of size $2$, the least element must be $2$, and there are ${12 \\choose 2} = 66$ subsets of size $2$.\nStep 5:  For subsets of size $3$, the least element must be $3$, and there are ${12 \\choose 3} = 220$ subsets of size $3$.\nStep 6:  Similarly, for subsets of size $4$, the least element must be $4$, and there are ${12 \\choose 4} = 495$ subsets of size $4$.\nStep 7:  Continuing this pattern, we can calculate the number of subsets for each size from $5$ to $12$.\nStep 8:  However, we need to be careful about the subsets of size $0$, as the problem specifies nonempty subsets.\nStep 9:  Therefore, we need to exclude the empty subset from the count for each size.\nStep 10:  After calculating the number of subsets for each size, we can sum them up to find the total number of nonempty subsets that satisfy the given condition.\nStep 11:  This will give us the final answer to the problem.\n\nStep 12:  Now, let's calculate the number of subsets for each size from $1$ to $12$ and sum them up to find the total number of nonempty subsets that satisfy the given condition.\n\nStep 13:  For size $1$, the number of subsets is $12$.\nStep 14:  For size $2$, the number of subsets is ${12 \\choose 2} = 66$.\nStep 15:  For size $3$, the number of subsets is ${12 \\choose 3} = 220$.\nStep 16:  For size $4$, the number of subsets is ${12 \\choose 4} = 495$.\nStep 17:  For size $5$, the number of subsets is ${12 \\choose 5} = 792$.\nStep 18:  For size $6$, the number of subsets is ${12 \\choose 6} = 924$.\nStep 19:  For size $7$, the number of subsets is ${12 \\choose 7} = 792$.\nStep 20:  For size $8$, the number of subsets is ${12 \\choose 8} = 495$.\nStep 21:  For size $9$, the number of subsets is ${12 \\choose 9} = 220$.\nStep 22:  For size $10$, the number of subsets is ${12 \\choose 10} = 66$.\nStep 23:  For size $11$, the number of subsets is ${12 \\choose 11} = 12$.\nStep 24:  For size $12$, the number of subsets is ${12 \\choose 12} = 1$.\n\nStep 25:  Now, let's sum up the number of subsets for each size to find the total number of nonempty subsets that satisfy the given condition.\n\nStep 26:  The total number of subsets is $12 + 66 + 220 + 495 + 792 + 924 + 792 + 495 + 220 + 66 + 12 + 1 = 4095$.\n\nStep 27:  Therefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{4095}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4095}$",
  "Step 1:  The given problem involves finding the area of a region in the coordinate plane defined by the inequality $| | x | - 1 | + | | y | - 1 | \\le 1$.\nStep 2:  To approach this problem, we first need to understand the nature of the inequality and how it defines the region in the coordinate plane.\nStep 3:  The inequality involves absolute values, which means the region will be defined by the intersection of multiple half-planes.\nStep 4:  We can start by analyzing the inequality $| | x | - 1 | + | | y | - 1 | \\le 1$ and try to break it down into simpler inequalities.\nStep 5:  We can consider the cases where $x \\ge 0$ and $x < 0$ separately, as the absolute value function changes its behavior based on the sign of the input.\nStep 6:  For $x \\ge 0$, the inequality becomes $| x - 1 | + | y - 1 | \\le 1$, and for $x < 0$, it becomes $| -x - 1 | + | y - 1 | \\le 1$.\nStep 7:  We can further simplify these inequalities by considering the cases where $y \\ge 0$ and $y < 0$ separately.\nStep 8:  By analyzing these cases, we can determine the boundaries of the region defined by the inequality and then find the area of the region.\nStep 9:  The region defined by the inequality is a square with vertices at $(0,0)$, $(2,0)$, $(2,2)$, and $(0,2)$.\nStep 10:  The area of a square is given by the formula $A = s^2$, where $s$ is the length of a side.\nStep 11:  In this case, the length of a side is 2, so the area of the region is $A = 2^2 = 4$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the area of the region defined by the inequality $| | x | - 1 | + | | y | - 1 | \\le 1$ is $\\boxed{4}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$"
