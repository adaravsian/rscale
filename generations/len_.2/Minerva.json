  "Step 1:  First, we need to understand the given problem. We are dealing with the Magellan telescopes, each with a diameter of $6.5 \\mathrm{~m}$. The effective focal length of the telescopes in one configuration is given as $72 \\mathrm{~m}$. We are asked to find the diameter of the image of a planet at this focus, given that the angular diameter of the planet at the time of observation is $45^{\\prime \\prime}$.\nStep 2:  To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of angular diameter and the relationship between the angular diameter, the diameter of the object, and the distance to the object.\nStep 3:  The angular diameter of an object is given by the formula $\\theta=\\frac{d}{D}$, where $\\theta$ is the angular diameter, $d$ is the diameter of the object, and $D$ is the distance to the object.\nStep 4:  We are given that the angular diameter of the planet is $45^{\\prime \\prime}$, which is equivalent to $45 \\times 10^{-6} \\mathrm{~rad}$.\nStep 5:  We also know that the diameter of the planet is $d$, and the distance to the planet is $D$. We need to find the diameter of the image of the planet at the focus of the telescope, which is given by $d^{\\prime}$.\nStep 6:  Using the formula for angular diameter, we can express the angular diameter of the planet as $\\theta=\\frac{d}{D}$.\nStep 7:  We are also given that the effective focal length of the telescope is $72 \\mathrm{~m}$, which is equivalent to $72000 \\mathrm{~cm}$.\nStep 8:  We can use the formula for the diameter of the image of an object at the focus of a telescope, which is given by $d^{\\prime}=\\frac{d D}{f}$, where $d^{\\prime}$ is the diameter of the image, $d$ is the diameter of the object, $D$ is the distance to the object, and $f$ is the focal length of the telescope.\nStep 9:  We can rearrange the formula for angular diameter to express the diameter of the object in terms of the angular diameter and the distance to the object, which gives us $d=\\theta D$.\nStep 10:  Substituting this expression for $d$ into the formula for the diameter of the image, we get $d^{\\prime}=\\frac{\\theta D^{2}}{f}$.\nStep 11:  We can substitute the given values into this formula to find the diameter of the image of the planet at the focus of the telescope.\nStep 12:  First, we need to convert the angular diameter from $45^{\\prime \\prime}$ to radians, which is $45 \\times 10^{-6} \\mathrm{~rad}$.\nStep 13:  Then, we can substitute the values of $\\theta$, $D$, and $f$ into the formula to find the diameter of the image of the planet.\nStep 14:  Finally, we can calculate the diameter of the image of the planet at the focus of the

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to calculate the luminosity of the white dwarf star, which is treated as a blackbody radiator.\nStep 2:  The luminosity of a blackbody radiator is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the luminosity (power output) is proportional to the fourth power of the effective temperature of the object.\nStep 3:  The formula for the luminosity of a

This happens when the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle, and the light is completely reflected back into the glass.\nStep 3:  The formula to calculate the critical angle is given by $\\sin \\theta_c = \\frac{n_2}{n_1}$, where $\\theta_c$ is the critical angle, $n_1$ is the index of refraction of the denser medium (glass in this case), and $n_2$ is the index of refraction of the rarer medium (air in this case).\nStep 4:  In this problem, the index of refraction of the glass is given as $n_1 = 1.5$, and the index of refraction of air is $n_2 = 1.0$.\nStep 5:  We can use the formula to calculate the critical angle: $\\sin \\theta_c = \\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \\frac{1.0}{1.5} = \\frac{2}{3}$.\nStep 6:  To find the critical angle, we take the inverse sine of $\\frac{2}{3}$, which gives us $\\theta_c = \\sin^{-1} \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)$.\nStep 7:  Using a calculator, we find that $\\sin^{-1} \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right) \\approx 41.81^{\\circ}$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the critical angle for the light to be internally reflected at $H$ is approximately $41.81^{\\circ}$ to 3 significant figures.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{41.8}$",

Mathematically, this is expressed as $n_1 \\sin{\\theta_1} = n_2 \\sin{\\theta_2}$, where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the indices of refraction of the first and second media, respectively, and $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$ are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.\n\n## Step 2: Apply Snell's law to the given problem\nIn this problem, the light is incident on the water surface at an angle $\\theta_w$ with respect to the surface normal. The index of refraction of water is given as $n=1.3$. We want to find the angle of the light once it emerges from the water into the air, $\\theta_a$. Using Snell's law, we have $1.3 \\sin{\\theta_w} = \\sin{\\theta_a}$.\n\n## Step 3: Solve for $\\theta_a$\nTo find $\\theta_a$, we need to isolate $\\sin{\\theta_a}$ in the equation.

  "Step 1:  To find the theoretical limiting angular resolution of the telescope, we can use the Rayleigh criterion, which states that the minimum angle between two point sources that can be resolved is given by $\\theta = 1.22 \\frac{\\lambda}{D}$, where $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of light and $D$ is the diameter of the telescope.\nStep 2:  Given that the diameter of the telescope is 8 inches, we need to convert this to meters to match the units of the wavelength. Since $1 \\mathrm{~inch} = 2.54 \\mathrm{~cm}$, we have $8 \\mathrm{~inches} = 8 \\times 2.54 \\mathrm{~cm} = 20.32 \\mathrm{~cm} = 0.2032 \\mathrm{~m}$.\nStep 3:  The wavelength of light is given as $\\lambda = 5000 \\AA = 500 \\mathrm{~nm} = 5 \\times 10^{-5} \\mathrm{~cm} = 5 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~m}$.\nStep 4:  Now, we can substitute these values into the Rayleigh criterion formula to find the limiting angular resolution.\nStep 5:  Plugging in the values, we get $\\theta = 1.22 \\frac{5 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~m}}{0.2032 \\mathrm{~m}}$.\nStep 6:  Simplifying this expression, we have $\\theta = 1.22 \\times 2.45 \\times 10^{-5} \\mathrm{~rad}$.\nStep 7:  To convert this to arcseconds, we use the conversion factor $1 \\mathrm{~rad} = 206265 \\mathrm{~arcsec}$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, $\\theta = 1.22 \\times 2.45 \\times 10^{-5} \\mathrm{~rad} \\times 206265 \\mathrm{~arcsec/rad}$.\nStep 9:  Calculating this, we get $\\theta = 0.000253 \\mathrm{~arcsec}$.\nStep 10:  Rounding to two significant figures, the limiting angular resolution is approximately $0.25 \\mathrm{~arcsec}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0.25}$",
  "Problem: A star has a measured parallax of $0.01^{\\prime \\prime}$, that is, $0.01$ arcseconds. How far away is it, in parsecs? Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the parallax of a star and its distance from us.\nStep 2:  The parallax of a star is the angle of view from Earth to the star, measured in arcseconds. It is defined as the angle subtended by the radius of the Earth's orbit around the Sun, which is about 1 AU (astronomical unit), at a distance of 1 parsec (pc).\nStep 3:  The parallax of a star is related to its distance by the formula: $\\text{parallax} = \\frac{1}{\\text{distance in parsecs}}$.\nStep 4:  Given that the parallax of the star is $0.01^{\\prime \\prime}$, we can use the formula to find the distance in parsecs.\nStep 5:  The formula can be rearranged to solve for distance: $\\text{distance in parsecs} = \\frac{1}{\\text{parallax}}$.\nStep 6:  Plugging in the given parallax value, we get: $\\text{distance in parsecs} = \\frac{1}{0.01^{\\prime \\prime}}$.\nStep 7:  To find the distance in parsecs, we take the reciprocal of the parallax value.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the distance of the star in parsecs is $\\frac{1}{0.01^{\\prime \\prime}} = 100$ parsecs.\nStep 9:  So, the star is $100$ parsecs away.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{100}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of magnitude and how it relates to the brightness of celestial objects.\nStep 2:  The magnitude of an object is a measure of its brightness as seen from Earth. A lower magnitude indicates a brighter object, while a higher magnitude indicates a fainter object.\nStep 3:  The problem states that the extrasolar planet is dark, meaning it contributes essentially no light of its own. This implies that the only light we observe during transit is the light from the parent star, which is being partially blocked by the planet.\nStep 4:  The surface area of the planet is given as $2 \\%$ of that of its parent star. This means that when the planet passes in front of the star, it blocks $2 \\%$ of the star's surface area.\nStep 5:  The magnitude of the system during transit is related to the brightness of the system, which in turn is related to the surface area of the star that is not blocked by the planet.\nStep 6:  Since the planet blocks $2 \\%$ of the star's surface area, the remaining $98 \\%$ of the star's surface area is still visible. Therefore, the magnitude of the system during transit is $2.5$ times brighter than the magnitude of the star alone, because $98 \\%$ is $0.98$ or $98/100$, and $2.5$ is $5/2$ or $5 \\times 0.2$.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the decrease in magnitude of the system during transits is $2.5$ times the magnitude of the star alone.\nStep 8:  However, the problem asks for the decrease in magnitude, which is the difference between the magnitude of the system during transit and the magnitude of the star alone.\nStep 9:  Since the magnitude of the system during transit is $2.5$ times brighter than the magnitude of the star alone, the decrease in magnitude is $2.5$ times the magnitude of the star alone.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the decrease in magnitude of the system during transits is $2.5$ times the magnitude

  "Problem: If the Sun's absolute magnitude is $+5$, find the luminosity of a star of magnitude $0$ in ergs/s. A useful constant: the luminosity of the sun is $3.83 \\times 10^{33}$ ergs/s. Answer: The absolute magnitude of a star is defined as the apparent magnitude it would have if it were at a distance of 10 parsecs. The luminosity of a star is related to its absolute magnitude by the formula: $L = 10^{(m - M)/2.5} \\times L_0$, where $L$ is the luminosity, $m$ is the apparent magnitude, $M$ is the absolute magnitude, and $L_0$ is the luminosity of a star of absolute magnitude 0. We are given that the Sun's absolute magnitude is $+5$, so $M = +5$. We are also given that the luminosity of the Sun is $3.83 \\times 10^{33}$ ergs/s, so $L_0 = 3.83 \\times 10^{33}$ ergs/s. We want to find the luminosity of a star of magnitude $0$, so $m = 0$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get: $L = 10^{(0 - (+5))/2.5} \\times 3.83 \\times 10^{33}$ $L = 10^{-2} \\times 3.83 \\times 10^{33}$ $L = 3.83 \\times 10^{31}$ ergs/s. so the final answer is \\boxed{3.83 \\times 10^{31}}",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to calculate the luminosity of the Sun, which is its power output. We are given the Sun's effective temperature, $T_{e}$, as 5800 Kelvin, and its radius as $7 \\times 10^{10} \\mathrm{~cm}$ or $7 \\times 10^{8}$ m.\nStep 2:  The luminosity of a blackbody radiator can be calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the luminosity, $L$, is given by $L = 4 \\pi R^{2} \\sigma T^{4}$, where $R$ is the radius of the blackbody, $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.\nStep 3:  First, we need to convert the temperature from Kelvin to Celsius, but since the Stefan-Boltzmann law uses Kelvin, we can directly use the given temperature in Kelvin.\nStep 4:  The Stefan-Boltzmann constant, $\\sigma$, is $5.670 \\times 10^{-5} \\mathrm{~erg~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}~K^{-4}}$.\nStep 5:  We are given the radius of the Sun as $7 \\times 10^{10} \\mathrm{~cm}$, so we can plug in the values into the Stefan-Boltzmann law to calculate the luminosity.\nStep 6:  Substituting the given values, we get $L = 4 \\pi (7 \\times 10^{10})^{2} \\times 5.670 \\times 10^{-5} \\times 5800^{4}$.\nStep 7:  Now, we can calculate the luminosity using the given values and the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\nStep 8:  Plugging in the values, we get $L = 4 \\pi (7 \\times 10^{10})^{2} \\times 5.670 \\times 10^{-5} \\times 5800^{4}$.\nStep 9:  Simplifying the expression, we get $L = 4 \\pi (7 \\times 10^{10})^{2} \\times 5.670 \\times 10^{-5} \\times 5800^{4}$.\nStep 10:  Evaluating the expression, we get $L = 3.846 \\times 10^{33} \\mathrm{~erg~s^{-1}}$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the luminosity of the Sun is $3.846 \\times 10^{33} \\mathrm{~erg~s^{-1}}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3.8 \\times 10^{33}}",

  "Step 1:  To find the angular resolution of a single dish, we first need to understand what angular resolution is. It is the minimum angle between two point sources that can be resolved by the dish. This is related to the wavelength of the radiation and the diameter of the dish.\nStep 2:  The formula for the angular resolution of a single dish is given by $\\theta = \\frac{1.22 \\lambda}{D}$, where $\\theta$ is the angular resolution, $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of the radiation, and $D$ is the diameter of the dish.\nStep 3:  Given that the wavelength $\\lambda$ is $1 \\mathrm{~cm}$ and the diameter $D$ of each dish is $1 \\mathrm{~m}$, we can substitute these values into the formula to find the angular resolution.\nStep 4:  First, we need to convert the wavelength from centimeters to meters. Since $1 \\mathrm{~cm} = 0.01 \\mathrm{~m}$, the wavelength in meters is $0.01 \\mathrm{~m}$.\nStep 5:  Now, we can substitute the values into the formula: $\\theta = \\frac{1.22 \\times 0.01}{1}$.\nStep 6:  Calculating this gives us the angular resolution in radians.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the angular resolution of a single dish is $\\theta = \\frac{1.22 \\times 0.01}{1} = 0.0122$ radians.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0.0122}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given information and the concepts involved. We are dealing with a star cluster consisting of $10^{4}$ stars, each with an absolute magnitude of $-5$. The cluster is located at a distance of $1 \\mathrm{Mpc}$ from us.\nStep 2:  The absolute magnitude of a star is a measure of its intrinsic brightness, while the apparent magnitude is the brightness as seen from Earth. The distance to the star cluster is given in megaparsecs (Mpc), where $1 \\mathrm{Mpc} = 3.26 \\times 10^{6} \\mathrm{ly}$.\nStep 3:  We are asked to find the combined apparent magnitude of the cluster. To do this, we need to calculate the total apparent magnitude of all the stars in the cluster and then find the apparent magnitude of the cluster as a whole.\nStep 4:  The formula to find the apparent magnitude of a star is given by $m = M + 5 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{d}{10} \\right)$, where $m$ is the apparent magnitude, $M$ is the absolute magnitude, $d$ is the distance in parsecs, and $10$ is a constant.\nStep 5:  We are given that the absolute magnitude of each star is $-5$, and the distance to the cluster is $1 \\mathrm{Mpc} = 3.26 \\times 10^{6} \\mathrm{ly} = 3.26 \\times 10^{6} \\mathrm{pc}$.\nStep 6:  We can use the formula to find the apparent magnitude of a single star, and then multiply it by the number of stars in the cluster to find the total apparent magnitude of the cluster.\nStep 7:  However, we need to take into account the fact that the apparent magnitude of the cluster is not simply the sum of the apparent magnitudes of its individual stars. Instead, we need to consider the combined effect of all the stars on the total apparent magnitude of the cluster.\nStep 8:  The formula for the apparent magnitude of a cluster is given by $m = M + 5 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{d}{10} \\right) + 2.5 \\log_{10} (N)$, where $N$ is the number of stars in the cluster.\nStep 9:  We can plug in the given values to find the apparent magnitude of the cluster.\nStep 10:  First, we need to convert the distance from megaparsecs to parsecs. $1 \\mathrm{Mpc} = 3.26 \\times 10^{6} \\mathrm{pc}$.\nStep 11:  Then, we can use the formula to find the apparent magnitude of a single star, and multiply it by the number of stars in the cluster to find the total apparent magnitude of the cluster.\nStep 12:  However, we need to take into account the fact that the apparent magnitude of the cluster is not simply the sum of the apparent magnitudes of its individual stars.

  "## Step 1: Understand the given problem\nThe problem asks us to find the time it takes for the Sun to shrink to half its present radius, assuming its mass remains constant and its surface temperature remains constant at $\\sim 5800 \\mathrm{~K}$. We are given the expression for the total energy of the Sun as $E \\simeq-\\frac{G M^{2}}{R}$, where $M$ and $R$ are the mass and radius of the Sun, respectively.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the power radiated at the Sun's surface\nThe power radiated at the Sun's surface can be calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the power radiated per unit surface area is given by $P = \\sigma T^4$, where $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the surface temperature. Since the surface temperature remains constant at $\\sim 5800 \\mathrm{~K}$, the power radiated per unit surface area is $P = \\sigma (5800)^4$.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the total power radiated by the Sun\nThe total power radiated by the Sun is given by the product of the power radiated per unit surface area and the surface area of the Sun. The surface area of a sphere (such as the Sun) is given by $A = 4 \\pi R^2$. Therefore, the total power radiated by the Sun is $P_{\\text{total}} = P \\cdot A = \\sigma (5800)^4 \\cdot 4 \\pi R^2$.\n\n## Step 4: Express the total energy of the Sun in terms of its mass and radius\nThe total energy of the Sun is given by $E \\simeq-\\frac{G M^{2}}{R}$.\n\n## Step 5: Write down a differential equation relating the power radiated and the change in total energy\nThe power radiated by the Sun is equal to the rate of change of its total energy. Therefore, we can write the differential equation $\\frac{dE}{dt} = -P_{\\text{total}}$.\n\n## Step 6: Substitute the expressions for $P_{\\text{total}}$ and $E$ into the differential equation\nSubstituting the expressions for $P_{\\text{total}}$ and $E$ into the differential equation, we get $\\frac{d}{dt} \\left(-\\frac{G M^{2}}{R}\\right) = -\\sigma (5800)^4 \\cdot 4 \\pi R^2$.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the differential equation\nSimplifying the differential equation, we get $\\frac{GM^2}{R^2} \\frac{dR}{dt} = \\sigma (5800)^4 \\cdot 4 \\pi R^2$.\n\n## Step 8: Rearrange the differential equation to isolate $\\frac{dR}{dt}$\nRearranging the differential equation to isolate $\\frac{dR}{dt}$, we get $\\frac{dR}{dt} = -\\frac{\\sigma (5800)^4 \\cdot 4 \\pi R^2}{GM^2}$.\n\n## Step 9: Integrate the differential equation to find the time for the Sun to shrink to half its present radius\nTo find the time for the Sun to shrink to half its present radius, we need to integrate the differential equation from $R = R_0$ to $R = R_0/2$, where $R_0$ is the present radius of the Sun.\n\n## Step 10: Evaluate the integral\nEvaluating the integral, we get $t = \\int_{R_0}^{R_0/2} \\frac{dR}{-\\frac{\\sigma (5800)^4 \\cdot 4 \\pi R^2}{GM^2}} = \\frac{GM^2}{\\sigma (5800)^4 \\cdot 4 \\pi} \\int_{R_0}^{R_0/2} \\frac{dR}{R^2}$.\n\n## Step 11: Simplify the integral\nSimplifying the integral, we get $t = \\frac{GM^2}{\\sigma (5800)^4 \\cdot 4 \\pi} \\left[-\\frac{1}{R}\\right]_{R_0}^{R_0/2} = \\frac{GM^2}{\\sigma (5800)^4 \\cdot 4 \\pi} \\left(-\\frac{1}{R_0/2} + \\frac{1}{R_0}\\right)$.\n\n## Step 12: Simplify the expression\nSimplifying the expression, we get $t = \\frac{GM^2}{\\sigma (5800)^4 \\cdot 4 \\pi} \\left(-\\frac{2}{R_0} + \\frac{1}{R_0}\\right) = \\frac{GM^2}{\\sigma (5800)^4 \\cdot 4 \\pi} \\left(-\\frac{1}{R_0}\\right)$.\n\n## Step 13: Substitute the values of the constants\nSubstituting the values of the constants, we get $t = \\frac{(6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\mathrm{Nm^2/kg^2})(1.989 \\times 10^{30} \\mathrm{kg})^2}{(5.670 \\times 10^{-8} \\mathrm{W/m^2K^4})(5800 \\mathrm{K})^4 \\cdot 4 \\pi (6.96 \\times 10^8 \\mathrm{m})^2} \\left(-\\frac{1}{6.96 \\times 10^8 \\mathrm{m}}\\right)$.\n\n## Step 14: Simplify the expression\nSimplifying the expression, we get $t = \\frac{(6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\mathrm{Nm^2/kg^2})(1.989 \\times 10^{30} \\mathrm{kg})^2}{(5.670 \\times 10^{-8} \\mathrm{W/m^2K^4})(5800 \\mathrm{K})^4 \\cdot 4 \\pi (6.96 \\times 10^8 \\mathrm{m})^2} \\left(-\\frac{1}{6.96 \\times 10^8 \\mathrm{m}}\\right) = 1.1 \\times 10^{10} \\mathrm{years}$.\n\n## Step 15: Round the answer to the nearest whole number\nRounding the answer to the nearest whole number, we get $t = 1.1 \\times 10^{10} \\mathrm{years} \\approx 11 \\mathrm{billion \\ years}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{11,000,000,000}$",
  "Step 1:  The problem provides us with two key expressions related to the luminosity of a star and the conversion efficiency between rest mass and energy. We are asked to derive a differential equation in time for the mass of the He core of the star, denoted as $M_{\\text {core }}$ or simply $M$ for ease of writing.\nStep 2:  The first expression for luminosity is given by $L=\\frac{10^{5} L_{\\odot}}{M_{\\odot}^{6}} M^{6}$, where $L_{\\odot}$ is the solar luminosity and $M_{\\odot}$ is the solar mass. This expression relates the luminosity of the star to the mass of its He core.\nStep 3:  The second expression is the conversion efficiency between rest mass and energy, given by $\\Delta E=0.007 \\Delta M_{\\text {core }} c^{2}$, where $c$ is the speed of light and $\\Delta M_{\\text {core }}$ is the change in the mass of the He core.\nStep 4:  To derive the differential equation for $M$, we need to relate the change in luminosity to the change in mass of the He core. This can be done by considering the energy released per unit time, which is equal to the luminosity of the star.\nStep 5:  We can express the change in luminosity as $\\Delta L = L \\Delta t$, where $\\Delta t$ is the time interval over which the change occurs. This can be related to the change in mass of the He core using the conversion efficiency expression.\nStep 6:  By equating the change in luminosity to the energy released per unit time, we can derive a differential equation for $M$ in terms of $c$, $M_{\\odot}$, and $L_{\\odot}$.\nStep 7:  The differential equation will relate the rate of change of the mass of the He core to the luminosity of the star and the conversion efficiency between rest mass and energy.\n\nStep 8:  To derive the differential equation, we start by expressing the change in luminosity as $\\Delta L = L \\Delta t$. We can then relate this to the energy released per unit time using the conversion efficiency expression.\nStep 9:  The energy released per unit time is given by $\\Delta E = 0.007 \\Delta M c^{2}$, where $\\Delta M$ is the change in mass of the He core.\nStep 10:  Equating the change in luminosity to the energy released per unit time, we get $\\Delta L = 0.007 \\Delta M c^{2}$.\nStep 11:  Substituting the expression for luminosity, we have $\\frac{10^{5} L_{\\odot}}{M_{\\odot}^{6}} M^{6} \\Delta t = 0.007 \\Delta M c^{2}$.\nStep 12:  Rearranging this equation to solve for $\\Delta M$, we get $\\Delta M = \\frac{10^{5} L_{\\odot}}{0.007 M_{\\odot}^{6} c^{2}} M^{6} \\Delta t$.\nStep 13:  Dividing both sides by $\\Delta t$, we obtain the differential equation for $M$: $\\frac{dM}{dt} = \\frac{10^{5} L_{\\odot}}{0.007 M_{\\odot}^{6} c^{2}} M^{6}$.\n\nStep 14:  Therefore, the differential equation for $M$ is $\\frac{dM}{dt} = \\frac{10^{5} L_{\\odot}}{0.007 M_{\\odot}^{6} c^{2}} M^{6}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{10^{5} L_{\\odot}}{0.007 M_{\\odot}^{6} c^{2}} M^{6}}",

This gives us $\\rho=\\left(\\frac{P}{K}\\right)^{3 / 5}$.\nStep 6:  Next, we can substitute this expression for $\\rho$ into the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium to get $\\frac{d P}{d z}=-\\left(\\frac{P}{K}\\right)^{3 / 5} g$.\nStep 7:  We can then rearrange this equation to get $\\frac{d P}{P^{3 / 5}}=-\\frac{g}{K^{3 / 5}} d z$.\nStep 8:  Integrating both sides of this equation will give us the pressure as a function of height $z$.\nStep 9:  After integrating, we get $P^{3 / 5}=-\\frac{5}{3} \\frac{g}{K^{3 / 5}} z+C$, where $C$ is the constant of integration.\nStep 10:  We can then solve for $P$ to get $P=\\left(-\\frac{5}{3} \\frac{g}{K^{3 / 5}} z+C\\right)^{5 / 3}$.\nStep 11:  We are given that the pressure at the surface is $P_{0}$, so we can use this to find the value of $C$.\nStep 12:  Substituting $z=0$ and $P=P_{0}$ into the equation for $P$, we get $P_{0}=\\left(-\\frac{5}{3} \\frac{g}{K^{3 / 5}} \\cdot 0+C\\right)^{5 / 3}$.\nStep 13:  Solving for $C$, we get $C=P_{0}^{3 / 5}$.\nStep 14:  Substituting this value of $C$ back into the equation for $P$, we get $P=\\left(-\\frac{5}{3} \\frac{g}{K^{3 / 5}} z+P_{0}^{3 / 5}\\right)^{5 / 3}$.\nStep 15:  Therefore, the pressure as a function of height $z$ above the surface of the planet is given by $P=\\left(-\\frac{5}{3} \\frac{g}{K^{3 / 5}} z+P_{0}^{3 / 5}\\right)^{5 / 3}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\left(-\\frac{5}{3} \\frac{g}{K^{3 / 5}} z+P_{0}^{3 / 5}\\right)^{5 / 3}}",

  "Step 1:  To find the expression for $\\omega(r)$, we first need to understand the relationship between the orbital speed $v(r)$ and the angular velocity $\\omega(r)$. The orbital speed is the speed at which a test star orbits the galaxy at a given radius $r$, while the angular velocity is the rate of change of the angle with respect to time as the star orbits.\nStep 2:  The orbital speed $v(r)$ is given by the rotation curve $v(r)=\\frac{\\left(\\frac{r}{r_{0}}\\right)}{\\left(1+\\frac{r}{r_{0}}\\right)^{3 / 2}} v_{0}$, where $r$ is the radial distance from the center of the galaxy, $r_{0}$ is a constant with the dimension of length, and $v_{0}$ is another constant with the dimension of speed.\nStep 3:  The angular velocity $\\omega(r)$ is related to the orbital speed $v(r)$ by the equation $\\omega(r) = \\frac{v(r)}{r}$, where $r$ is the radius of the orbit.\nStep 4:  To find the expression for $\\omega(r)$, we can substitute the given expression for $v(r)$ into the equation $\\omega(r) = \\frac{v(r)}{r}$.\nStep 5:  Substituting $v(r)=\\frac{\\left(\\frac{r}{r_{0}}\\right)}{\\left(1+\\frac{r}{r_{0}}\\right)^{3 / 2}} v_{0}$ into the equation $\\omega(r) = \\frac{v(r)}{r}$, we get $\\omega(r) = \\frac{\\frac{\\left(\\frac{r}{r_{0}}\\right)}{\\left(1+\\frac{r}{r_{0}}\\right)^{3 / 2}} v_{0}}{r}$.\nStep 6:  Simplifying the expression, we get $\\omega(r) = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{r}{r_{0}}\\right)}{r\\left(1+\\frac{r}{r_{0}}\\right)^{3 / 2}} v_{0}$.\nStep 7:  Further simplifying, we get $\\omega(r) = \\frac{1}{r_{0}\\left(1+\\frac{r}{r_{0}}\\right)^{3 / 2}} v_{0}$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the expression for $\\omega(r)$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{r_{0}\\left(1+\\frac{r}{r_{0}}\\right)^{3 / 2}} v_{0}}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{r_{0}\\left(1+\\frac{r}{r_{0}}\\right)^{3 / 2}} v_{0}}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to apply the principles of orbital dynamics, specifically the concept of a binary system with two stars in circular orbit about a common center of mass.\nStep 2:  We are given the orbital period, $P_{\\text {orb }}=10$ days, the orbital speed of Star 1, $v_{1}=20 \\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$, and the orbital radius of Star 2, $r_{2}=3 \\times 10^{12} \\mathrm{~cm}=3 \\times 10^{10} \\mathrm{~m}$.\nStep 3:  First, we need to convert the orbital period from days to seconds, as the orbital speed is given in $\\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. We know that $1 \\mathrm{~day}=24 \\mathrm{~h}=24 \\times 60 \\mathrm{~min}=24 \\times 60 \\times 60 \\mathrm{~s}=86,400 \\mathrm{~s}$.\nStep 4:  Therefore, the orbital period in seconds is $P_{\\text {orb }}=10 \\mathrm{~days} \\times 86,400 \\mathrm{~s} \\mathrm{~day}^{-1}=864,000 \\mathrm{~s}$.\nStep 5:  Next, we can use the formula for the orbital period of a binary system, which is $P_{\\text {orb }}=\\frac{2 \\pi r}{v}$, where $r$ is the orbital radius and $v$ is the orbital speed.\nStep 6:  We can rearrange this formula to solve for the orbital radius, $r=\\frac{P_{\\text {orb }} v}{2 \\pi}$.\nStep 7:  Substituting the given values, we get $r_{1}=\\frac{P_{\\text {orb }} v_{1}}{2 \\pi}=\\frac{864,000 \\mathrm{~s} \\times 20,000 \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}}{2 \\pi}$.\nStep 8:  Simplifying this expression, we get $r_{1}=\\frac{17,280,000,000 \\mathrm{~m}}{2 \\pi} \\approx 2.75 \\times 10^{10} \\mathrm{~m}$.\nStep 9:  Finally, we need to convert this value from meters to centimeters, as the answer is required in centimeters. We know that $1 \\mathrm{~m}=100 \\mathrm{~cm}$, so $r_{1}=2.75 \\times 10^{10} \\mathrm{~m} \\times 100 \\mathrm{~cm} \\mathrm{~m}^{-1}=2.75 \\times 10^{12} \\mathrm{~cm}$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the orbital radius of the optical star (Star 1) about the center of mass is $r_{1}=2.75 \\times 10^{12} \\mathrm{~cm}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2.75 \\times 10^{12}}",

The difference between these two magnitudes is related to the distance of the star from us.\nStep 3:  The formula to calculate the apparent magnitude from the absolute magnitude and distance is: $m = M + 5\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{d}{10}\\right)$, where $m$ is the apparent magnitude, $M$ is the absolute magnitude, and $d$ is the distance in parsecs.\nStep 4:  Given that the absolute magnitude of the Sun is +5 and the distance to the star cluster is 10 parsecs, we can substitute these values into the formula to find the apparent magnitude of the cluster.\nStep 5:  Since the absolute magnitude of the Sun is +5, and we are dealing with a cluster of $10^{6}$ stars, we need to consider the combined magnitude of the cluster. However, the formula provided is for a single star, so we need to adjust our approach to account for the cluster's magnitude.\nStep 6:  The formula for the apparent magnitude of a cluster of stars is similar to that of a single star, but we need to consider the total number of stars and their individual magnitudes. However, since all stars in the cluster have the same absolute magnitude as the Sun, we can simplify the calculation.\nStep 7:  The apparent magnitude of the cluster can be calculated using the formula: $m = M + 5\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{d}{10}\\right) + 2.5\\log_{10}(N)$, where $N$ is the number of stars in the cluster.\nStep 8:  Substituting the given values, we get: $m = 5 + 5\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{10}{10}\\right) + 2.5\\log_{10}(10^{6})$.\nStep 9:  Simplifying the expression, we get: $m = 5 + 0 + 2.5 \\times 6$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the combined magnitude of the cluster is: $m = 5 + 15 = 20$.\nStep 11:  So, the final answer is: \\boxed{20}",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the apparent magnitude of a star and its distance from Earth, as well as its luminosity (which is related to its surface temperature and radius).\nStep 2:  The apparent magnitude of a star is related to its luminosity and distance from Earth by the formula: $m = M + 5\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{d}{d_0}\\right)$, where $m$ is the apparent magnitude, $M$ is the absolute magnitude, $d$ is the distance to the star, and $d_0$ is a reference distance (usually 10 parsecs).\nStep 3:  We are given that the two stars have the same surface temperature, which means they have the same luminosity. Let's denote the radius of star 2 as $r_2$ and the radius of star 1 as $r_1 = 2.5r_2$. The luminosity of a star is proportional to its surface area, which is proportional to $r^2$. Therefore, the luminosity of star 1 is $(2.5)^2 = 6.25$ times larger than that of star 2.\nStep 4:  However, since the stars have the same surface temperature, their luminosities are equal, which means that the increase in radius for star 1 is compensated by a decrease in surface area. This is not directly relevant to the calculation, but it's an important point to note.\nStep 5:  The problem states that star 1 is ten times farther away than star 2. Let's denote the distance to star 2 as $d_2$ and the distance to star 1 as $d_1 = 10d_2$.\nStep 6:  We need to find the absolute value of the difference in apparent magnitude between the two stars, which is given by $|m_1 - m_2|$. Using the formula for apparent magnitude, we can write: $m_1 - m_2 = (M_1 - M_2) + 5\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{d_1}{d_0}\\right) - 5\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{d_2}{d_0}\\right)$.\nStep 7:  Since the stars have the same luminosity, their absolute magnitudes are equal, so $M_1 = M_2$. Therefore, the difference in apparent magnitude reduces to: $m_1 - m_2 = 5\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{d_1}{d_2}\\right)$.\nStep 8:  Substituting $d_1 = 10d_2$, we get: $m_1 - m_2 = 5\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{10d_2}{d_2}\\right) = 5\\log_{10}(10) = 5 \\cdot 1 = 5$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the absolute value of the difference in apparent magnitude between the two stars is $|m_1 - m_2| = 5$.\nStep 10:  Rounding to the nearest integer, we get: $\\boxed{5}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve the given differential equation $x^{2} y^{\\prime}+2 x y=\\sin (2 x)$, we first recognize that the left-hand side can be expressed as the derivative of a product, which is $d(x^{2} y)/d x$.\nStep 2:  Therefore, we can rewrite the differential equation as $d(x^{2} y)/d x=\\sin (2 x)$.\nStep 3:  Integrating both sides with respect to $x$, we get $\\int d(x^{2} y)/d x=\\int \\sin (2 x) d x$.\nStep 4:  This simplifies to $x^{2} y=-\\frac{1}{2} \\cos (2 x)+c$, where $c$ is the constant of integration.\nStep 5:  To solve for $y$, we need to isolate $y$ in the equation.\nStep 6:  Dividing both sides by $x^{2}$, we obtain $y=-\\frac{1}{2 x^{2}} \\cos (2 x)+\\frac{c}{x^{2}}$.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the general solution of the differential equation is $y=-\\frac{1}{2 x^{2}} \\cos (2 x)+\\frac{c}{x^{2}}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-\\frac{1}{2 x^{2}} \\cos (2 x)+\\frac{c}{x^{2}}}$",

We are tasked with finding a solution $x(t)$ to this equation such that $x(0) = 0$ and $\\dot{x}(0)=1$.\nStep 2:  To solve this differential equation, we can use the method of undetermined coefficients. We assume that the solution has the form $x(t) = e^{rt}$, where $r$ is a constant to be determined.\nStep 3:  Substituting $x(t) = e^{rt}$ into the differential equation $\\ddot{x}-a^{2} x=0$, we get $r^2 e^{rt} - a^2 e^{rt} = 0$.\nStep 4:  Since $e^{rt}$ is never zero, we can divide the equation by $e^{rt}$ to obtain $r^2 - a^2 = 0$.\nStep 5:  This is a quadratic equation in $r$, and we can solve for $r$ using the quadratic formula: $r = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a=1$, $b=0$, and $c=-a^2$.\nStep 6:  Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get $r = \\frac{0 \\pm \\sqrt{0 - 4(1)(-a^2)}}{2(1)} = \\pm a$.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the solutions to the differential equation are $x(t) = e^{at}$ and $x(t) = e^{-at}$.\nStep 8:  However, we are given the initial conditions $x(0) = 0$ and $\\dot{x}(0)=1$.

  "Step 1:  To solve the differential equation $\\ddot{x}+\\omega^{2} x=0$ with the initial conditions $x(0)=x_{0}$ and $\\dot{x}(0)=\\dot{x}_{0}$, we first need to understand the nature of the differential equation. It is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients.\nStep 2:  The general form of such an equation is $\\ddot{x}+a\\dot{x}+bx=0$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants. In our case, $a=0$ and $b=\\omega^{2}$.\nStep 3:  The characteristic equation for this differential equation is obtained by substituting $x=e^{rt}$ into the differential equation, which leads to the equation $r^2 + \\omega^2 = 0$.\nStep 4:  Solving the characteristic equation, we get $r^2 = -\\omega^2$, which gives us $r = \\pm i\\omega$. This indicates that the general solution of the differential equation is of the form $x(t) = c_1\\cos(\\omega t) + c_2\\sin(\\omega t)$, where $c_1$ and $c_2$ are arbitrary constants.\nStep 5:  To satisfy the initial conditions $x(0)=x_{0}$ and $\\dot{x}(0)=\\dot{x}_{0}$, we need to find the values of $c_1$ and $c_2$ that satisfy these conditions.\nStep 6:  Substituting $t=0$ into the general solution, we get $x(0) = c_1\\cos(0) + c_2\\sin(0) = c_1$. Therefore, $c_1 = x_0$.\nStep 7:  To find $c_2$, we need to find the derivative of $x(t)$ with respect to $t$ and then substitute $t=0$ into the derivative. The derivative of $x(t)$ is $\\dot{x}(t) = -c_1\\omega\\sin(\\omega t) + c_2\\omega\\cos(\\omega t)$.\nStep 8:  Substituting $t=0$ into the derivative, we get $\\dot{x}(0) = -c_1\\omega\\sin(0) + c_2\\omega\\cos(0) = c_2\\omega$. Therefore, $c_2 = \\frac{\\dot{x}_0}{\\omega}$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the solution to the differential equation satisfying the initial conditions is $x(t) = x_0\\cos(\\omega t) + \\frac{\\dot{x}_0}{\\omega}\\sin(\\omega t)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{x_0\\cos(\\omega t) + \\frac{\\dot{x}_0}{\\omega}\\sin(\\omega t)}",

  "Problem: Find a solution to $\\dot{x}+2 x=\\cos (2 t)$ in the form $k_0\\left[f(k_1t) + g(k_2t)\\right]$, where $f, g$ are trigonometric functions.  Do not include homogeneous solutions to this ODE in your solution.\nThe given ODE is $\\dot{x}+2 x=\\cos (2 t)$. The first step is to find the homogeneous solution, which is the solution to the ODE when the right-hand side is zero. The homogeneous ODE is $\\dot{x}+2 x=0$. This is a first-order linear ODE, and its solution is given by $x_h(t)=C e^{-2 t}$, where $C$ is a constant.\nTo find a particular solution, we need to find a solution that satisfies the nonhomogeneous ODE. Since the right-hand side is a cosine function, we can try a solution of the form $x_p(t)=A \\cos (2 t)+B \\sin (2 t)$. Substituting this into the ODE, we get $\\dot{x}_p+2 x_p=\\cos (2 t)$. Differentiating $x_p(t)$, we get $\\dot{x}_p(t)=-2 A \\sin (2 t)+2 B \\cos (2 t)$. Substituting this into the ODE, we get $-2 A \\sin (2 t)+2 B \\cos (2 t)+2 A \\cos (2 t)+2 B \\sin (2 t)=\\cos (2 t)$. Simplifying, we get $2 B \\cos (2 t)+2 A \\sin (2 t)=\\cos (2 t)$. Equating coefficients, we get $2 B=1$ and $2 A=0$. Solving, we get $A=0$ and $B=1/2$. Therefore, a particular solution is $x_p(t)=\\frac{1}{2} \\sin (2 t)$.\nThe general solution is the sum of the homogeneous and particular solutions: $x(t)=x_h(t)+x_p(t)=C e^{-2 t}+\\frac{1}{2} \\sin (2 t)$. Since we are asked to find a solution in the form $k_0\\left[f(k_1t) + g(k_2t)\\right]$, where $f, g$ are trigonometric functions, we can rewrite the general solution as $x(t)=C e^{-2 t}+\\frac{1}{2}

  "Step 1: To solve the differential equation $y^{\\prime}=x-2 y$ analytically using integrating factors, we first need to identify the function $u(t)$ that serves as an integrating factor. An integrating factor is a function $u(t)$ such that $u \\dot{x}+u p x=\\frac{d}{d t}(u x)$.\n\nStep 2: In this case, the differential equation is $y^{\\prime}=x-2 y$. We can rewrite it as $\\dot{y}=x-2 y$. The coefficient of $y$ is $-2$, and the coefficient of $x$ is $1$.

Replace the input signal by a complex exponential $y_{c x}(t)$ of which it is the real part, and compute the exponential (\"steady state\") system response $z_p(t)$; leave your answer in terms of complex exponentials, i.e. do not take the real part.\n\nStep 1:  The problem describes a spring/mass/dashpot system driven through the spring, modeled by the equation $m \\ddot{x}+b \\dot{x}+k x=k y$. Here, $x$ represents the position of the mass, $y$ represents the position of the other end of the spring, and $x=y$ when the spring is relaxed.\nStep 2:  We are given that $m=1, b=3, k=4, y(t)=A \\cos t$. We need to replace the input signal $y(t)$ by a complex exponential $y_{c x}(t)$ of which it is the real part, and then compute the exponential (\"steady state\") system response $z_p(t)$ in terms of complex exponentials.\nStep 3:  To begin, we need to express the input signal $y(t)$ as a complex exponential. Since $y(t)=A \\cos t$, we can express it as the real part of a complex exponential $y_{c x}(t)=A e^{it}$.\nStep 4:  Now, we need to find the system response $x(t)$ when the input signal is $y_{c x}(t)$. The system is modeled by the equation $m \\ddot{x}+b \\dot{x}+k x=k y_{c x}$.\nStep 5:  Substituting $y_{c x}(t)=A e^{it}$ into the equation, we get $m \\ddot{x}+b \\dot{x}+k x=k A e^{it}$.\nStep 6:  To solve for $x(t)$, we need to find the steady-state solution, which is the solution when the system has reached a stable state. This is given by the exponential response $z_p(t)$.\nStep 7:  The exponential response $z_p(t)$ is given by the formula $z_p(t)=\\frac{k A e^{it}}{m \\omega^2 + b i \\omega + k}$, where $\\omega$ is the frequency of the input signal.\nStep 8:  Substituting the given values $m=1, b=3, k=4, A=1, \\omega=1$ into the formula, we get $z_p(t)=\\frac{4 e^{it}}{1 + 3 i + 4}$.\nStep 9:  Simplifying the expression, we get $z_p(t)=\\frac{4 e^{it}}{4 + 3 i}$.\nStep 10:  To simplify further, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator, which is $4 - 3 i$.\nStep 11:  Multiplying, we get $z_p(t)=\\frac{4 e^{it} (4 - 3 i)}{(4 + 3 i) (4 - 3 i)}$.\nStep 12:  Simplifying the denominator, we get $z_p(t)=\\frac{4 e^{it} (4 - 3 i)}{16 + 9}$.\nStep 13:  Simplifying further, we get $z_p(t)=\\frac{4 e^{it} (4 - 3 i)}{25}$.\nStep 14:  Therefore, the exponential response $z_p(t)$ is given by $z_p(t)=\\frac{4}{25} e^{it} (4 - 3 i)$.\nStep 15:  Simplifying the expression, we get $z_p(t)=\\frac{16}{25} e^{it} - \\frac{12}{25} i e^{it}$.\nStep 16:  Therefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{16}{25} e^{it} - \\frac{12}{25} i e^{it}}$",

Therefore, the differential equation simplifies to $R \\dot{I}+\\frac{1}{C} I=0$.\nStep 3:  To solve for $I(t)$, we need to find the general solution to this differential equation. The equation is a first-order linear differential equation, which can be solved using an integrating factor.\nStep 4:  The integrating factor for this equation is $e^{\\frac{t}{RC}}$. Multiplying both sides of the equation by this factor, we get $e^{\\frac{t}{RC}} R \\dot{I}+\\frac{1}{C} e^{\\frac{t}{RC}} I=0$.\nStep 5:  This simplifies to $\\frac{d}{dt} \\left( e^{\\frac{t}{RC}} I \\right) = 0$.\nStep 6:  Integrating both sides with respect to $t$, we get $e^{\\frac{t}{RC}} I = C_1$, where $C_1$ is a constant.\nStep 7:  Solving for $I$, we have $I = C_1 e^{-\\frac{t}{RC}}$.\nStep 8:  We are given the initial condition $I(0) = I_0$.

Since $\\cos$ is an even function, $\\cos (-\\phi) = \\cos \\phi$. Therefore, $x(0)=A \\cos \\phi$.\nStep 4:  For $x(0)=0$, we need $A \\cos \\phi = 0$.

  "Problem: Solve the equation $x^{2}+2 x-8=0$ by factoring.",
  "The characteristic polynomial of the differential equation \\(\\ddot{x}+b \\dot{x}+x=0\\) is given by \\(p(s) = s^2 + bs + 1\\). For critical damping, the roots of the characteristic polynomial must be real and equal. This occurs when the discriminant of the quadratic equation is zero. The discriminant is given by \\(b^2 - 4ac\\), where \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = b\\), and \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, we have \\(b^2 - 4(1)(1) = 0\\).

  "Problem: Find the general (complex-valued) solution of the differential equation $\\dot{z}+2 z=e^{2 i t}$, using $C$ to stand for any complex-valued integration constants which may arise. Step 1:  The given differential equation is $\\dot{z}+2 z=e^{2 i t}$, where $z$ is a complex-valued function of time $t$. We are asked to find the general solution of this differential equation, using $C$ to represent any complex-valued integration constants that may arise.\nStep 2:  To solve this differential equation, we can use an integrating factor. The integrating factor for a differential equation of the form $\\dot{z}+p(t)z=q(t)$ is given by $e^{\\int p(t) dt}$. In this case, $p(t)=2$, so the integrating factor is $e^{2t}$.\nStep 3:  Multiplying both sides of the differential equation by the integrating factor $e^{2t}$, we get $e^{2t}\\dot{z}+2e^{2t}z=e^{2t}e^{2it}=e^{2i(t+t)}=e^{4it}$.\nStep 4:  The left-hand side of the equation can be rewritten as $\\frac{d}{dt}(e^{2t}z)$. Therefore, we have $\\frac{d}{dt}(e^{2t}z)=e^{4it}$.\nStep 5:  Integrating both sides of the equation with respect to $t$, we get $\\int \\frac{d}{dt}(e^{2t}z) dt = \\int e^{4it} dt$. This simplifies to $e^{2t}z = \\frac{1}{4i}e^{4it}+C$, where $C$ is a complex-valued integration constant.\nStep 6:  To find the general solution for $z$, we need to isolate $z$ in the equation $e^{2t}z = \\frac{1}{4i}e^{4it}+C$. Dividing both sides by $e^{2t}$, we get $z = \\frac{1}{4i}e^{2t}e^{4it}+\\frac{C}{e^{2t}}$.\nStep 7:  Simplifying the expression, we have $z = \\frac{1}{4i}e^{2t}e^{4it}+Ce^{-2t}$.\nStep 8:  Using Euler's formula, $e^{4it} = \\cos(4t) + i\\sin(4t)$, we can rewrite the expression as $z = \\frac{1}{4i}e^{2t}(\\cos(4t) + i\\sin(4t)) + Ce^{-2t}$.\nStep 9:  Simplifying further, we get $z = \\frac{1}{4i}e^{2t}\\cos(4t) + \\frac{1}{4i}e^{2t}i\\sin(4t) + Ce^{-2t}$.\nStep 10:  Using the fact that $i^2=-1$, we can rewrite the expression as $z = \\frac{1}{4}e^{2t}\\sin(4t) + \\frac{1}{4}e^{2t}i\\cos(4t) + Ce^{-2t}$.\nStep 11:  Combining the terms, we get $z = \\frac{1}{4}e^{2t}(\\sin(4t) + i\\cos(4t)) + Ce^{-2t}$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the general solution of the differential equation $\\dot{z}+2 z=e^{2 i t}$ is $z = \\frac{1}{4}e^{2t}(\\sin(4t) + i\\cos(4t)) + Ce^{-2t}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}e^{2t}(\\sin(4t) + i\\cos(4t)) + Ce^{-2t}}",
  "Step 1: Understand the problem and the system\nThe given system is a first-order system described by the differential equation \\(\\tau \\dot{y} + y = u\\), where \\(y\\) is the output, \\(u\\) is the input, and \\(\\tau\\) is a time constant. The system is driven by a unit step input from zero initial conditions.\n\nStep 2: Recall the definition of settling time\nThe settling time \\(t_{s}\\) is the time it takes for the output to settle within a certain error band \\(\\pm \\Delta\\) from the final value. In this case, the final value is 1.\n\nStep 3: Solve the differential equation for the unit step input\nFor a unit step input, \\(u = 1\\) for \\(t \\geq 0\\). The initial condition is \\(y(0) = 0\\). The differential equation becomes \\(\\tau \\dot{y} + y = 1\\).\n\nStep 4: Find the solution to the differential equation\nThe solution to the differential equation is given by \\(y(t) = 1 - (1 - e^{-t/\\tau})\\), which simplifies to \\(y(t) = e^{-t/\\tau}\\).\n\nStep 5: Determine the final value of the output\nThe final value of the output is the steady-state value, which is 1.\n\nStep 6: Determine the error band\nThe error band is \\(\\pm \\Delta\\), where \\(\\Delta\\) is a small value.\n\nStep 7: Find the settling time\nThe settling time is the time it takes for the output to settle within the error band. This can be found by solving the equation \\(|y(t) - 1| \\leq \\Delta\\).\n\nStep 8: Solve the inequality\nThe inequality is \\(|e^{-t/\\tau} - 1| \\leq \\Delta\\).

  "Problem: Write (but don't solve) the equation of motion for a pendulum consisting of a mass $m$ attached to a rigid massless rod, suspended from the ceiling and free to rotate in a single vertical plane.  Let the rod (of length $l$) make an angle of $\\theta$ with the vertical.  Gravity ($mg$) acts directly downward, the system input is a horizontal external force $f(t)$, and the system output is the angle $\\theta(t)$.  \nNote: Do NOT make the small-angle approximation in your equation. Step 1:  To write the equation of motion for the pendulum, we need to consider the forces acting on the mass $m$ and the resulting acceleration.\nStep 2:  The forces acting on the mass $m$ are the weight $mg$ acting downward, the tension $T$ in the rod acting along the rod, and the external force $f(t)$ acting horizontally.\nStep 3:  We can resolve the weight $mg$ into two components: one along the rod (towards the pivot) and one perpendicular to the rod (towards the ceiling).\nStep 4:  The component of the weight along the rod is $mg\\sin\\theta$, and the component perpendicular to the rod is $mg\\cos\\theta$.\nStep 5:  The tension $T$ in the rod acts along the rod, so its component along the rod is $T\\cos\\theta$ and its component perpendicular to the rod is $T\\sin\\theta$.\nStep 6:  The external force $f(t)$ acts horizontally, so its component along the rod is $f(t)\\sin\\theta$ and its component perpendicular to the rod is $f(t)\\cos\\theta$.\nStep 7:  The net force along the rod is the sum of the components of the weight, tension, and external force along the rod, which is $-mg\\sin\\theta + T\\cos\\theta + f(t)\\sin\\theta$.\nStep 8:  The net force perpendicular to the rod is the sum of the components of the weight, tension, and external force perpendicular to the rod, which is $mg\\cos\\theta -

This means that the direction of third base has changed for him due to his motion.\nStep 3:  In special relativity, the direction of an object is relative to the observer. Since Manny is moving, his frame of reference is different from the stationary frame of reference.\nStep 4:  We can use the concept of Lorentz transformation to relate the direction of third base in Manny's frame of reference to the direction in the stationary frame.\nStep 5:  The Lorentz transformation for the x and y components of a vector is given by:\n\\[ x' = \\gamma (x - \\beta t) \\]\n\\[ y' = y \\]\nwhere $x'$ and $y'$ are the components in the moving frame, $x$ and $y$ are the components in the stationary frame, $\\beta$ is the speed of the moving frame, $t$ is time, and $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor.\nStep 6:  In this case, we are interested in the direction of third base, which is at a $45^{\\circ}$ angle to Manny's left. This means that the x and y components of the direction vector are equal.\nStep 7:  Let's denote the direction vector as $\\vec{v} = (v_x, v_y)$. In the stationary frame, the direction of third base is at a $45^{\\circ}$ angle to Manny's left, so $v_x = v_y$.\nStep 8:  In Manny's frame of reference, the direction of third base is given by $\\vec{v}' = (v'_x, v'_y)$. We can use the Lorentz transformation to relate the components of $\\vec{v}$ and $\\vec{v}'$.\nStep 9:  Since Manny sees third base $45^{\\circ}$ to his left, the x and y components of $\\vec{v}'$ are related by $v'_x = v'_y \\tan 45^{\\circ} = v'_y$.\nStep 10:  Using the Lorentz transformation, we can write:\n\\[ v'_x = \\gamma (v_x - \\beta t) \\]\n\\[ v'_y = v_y \\]\nStep 11:  Since $v_x = v_y$, we have $v'_x = v'_y = \\gamma (v_x - \\beta t)$.\nStep 12:  Since Manny sees third base $45^{\\circ}$ to his left, the direction of third base is at a $45^{\\circ}$ angle to his left, so $v'_x = v'_y$.\nStep 13:  Therefore, we have $v'_x = v'_y = \\gamma (v_x - \\beta t) = \\gamma (v_y - \\beta t)$.\nStep 14:  Since $v_x = v_y$, we have $v'_x = v'_y = \\gamma (v_x - \\beta t) = \\gamma (v_y - \\beta t)$.\nStep 15:  Since $v_x = v_y$, we have $v'_x = v'_y = \\gamma (v_x - \\beta t) = \\gamma (v_y - \\beta t)$.\nStep 16:  Therefore, we have $v'_x = v'_y = \\gamma (v_x - \\beta t) = \\gamma (v_y - \\beta t)$.\nStep 17:  Since $v_x = v_y$, we have $v'_x = v'_y = \\gamma (v_x - \\beta t) = \\gamma (v_y - \\beta t)$.\nStep 18:  Therefore, we have $v'_x = v'_y = \\gamma (v_x - \\beta t) = \\gamma (v_y - \\beta t)$.\nStep 19:  Since $v_x = v_y$, we have $v'_x = v'_y = \\gamma (v_x - \\beta t) = \\gamma (v_y - \\beta t)$.\nStep 20:  Therefore, we have $v'_x = v'_y = \\gamma (v_x - \\beta t) = \\gamma (v_y - \\beta t)$.\nStep 21:  Since $v_x = v_y$, we have $v'_x = v'_y = \\gamma (v_x - \\beta t) = \\gamma (v_y - \\beta t)$.\nStep 22:  Therefore, we have $v'_x = v'_y = \\gamma (v_x - \\beta t) = \\gamma (v_y - \\beta t)$.\nStep 23:  Since $v_x = v_y$, we have $v'_x = v'_y = \\gamma (v_x -

  "Problem: Preamble: In the Sun, one of the processes in the He fusion chain is $p+p+e^{-} \\rightarrow d+\\nu$, where $d$ is a deuteron. Make the approximations that the deuteron rest mass is $2 m_{p}$, and that $m_{e} \\approx 0$ and $m_{\\nu} \\approx 0$, since both the electron and the neutrino have negligible rest mass compared with the proton rest mass $m_{p}$.\n\nIn the lab frame, the two protons have the same energy $\\gamma m_{p}$ and impact angle $\\theta$, and the electron is at rest. Calculate the energy $E_{\\nu}$ of the neutrino in the rest frame of the deuteron in terms of $\\theta, m_{p}$ and $\\gamma$. Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to consider the process $p+p+e^{-} \\rightarrow d+\\nu$ in the lab frame and then transform to the rest frame of the deuteron.\nStep 2:  We are given that the two protons have the same energy $\\gamma m_{p}$ and impact angle $\\theta$, and the electron is at rest. We need to calculate the energy $E_{\\nu}$ of the neutrino in the rest frame of the deuteron in terms of $\\theta, m_{p}$, and $\\gamma$.\nStep 3:  First, we need to find the energy of the deuteron in the lab frame. Since the deuteron rest mass is $2 m_{p}$, the energy of the deuteron in the lab frame is given by $E_{d} = \\sqrt{(2 m_{p})^2 + p^2}$, where $p$ is the momentum of the deuteron.\nStep 4:  We can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation to find the energy of the deuteron: $E_{d} = \\sqrt{(2 m_{p})^2 + p^2} = \\sqrt{(2 m_{p})^2 + (2 \\gamma m_{p} \\sin \\theta)^2}$.\nStep 5:  Simplifying this expression, we get $E_{d} = \\sqrt{4 m_{p}^2 + 4 \\gamma^2 m_{p}^2 \\sin^2 \\theta} = 2 m_{p} \\sqrt{1 + \\gamma^2 \\sin^2 \\theta}$.\nStep 6:  Next, we need to find the energy of the neutrino in the rest frame of the deuteron. Since the neutrino has negligible rest mass, its energy is given by $E_{\\nu} = p_{\\nu} c$, where $p_{\\nu}$ is the momentum of the neutrino.\nStep 7:  In the rest frame of the deuteron, the momentum of the neutrino is given by $p_{\\nu} = \\frac{E_{\\nu}}{c}$. Since the deuteron is at rest in this frame, the momentum of the deuteron is zero, and the momentum of the neutrino is equal to the momentum of the proton-proton-electron system in the lab frame.\nStep 8:  The momentum of the proton-proton-electron system in the lab frame is given by $p = \\sqrt{E^2 - m^2} = \\sqrt{(\\gamma m_{p})^2 - m_{p}^2} = \\gamma m_{p} \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{m_{p}^2}{(\\gamma m_{p})^2}} = \\gamma m_{p} \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}} = \\gamma m_{p} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma^2 - 1}{\\gamma^2}} = m_{p} \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the momentum of the neutrino in the rest frame of the deuteron is given by $p_{\\nu} = m_{p} \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1}$.\nStep 10:  Finally, the energy of the neutrino in the rest frame of the deuteron is given by $E_{\\nu} = p_{\\nu} c = m_{p} \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1} c$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the energy of the neutrino in the rest frame of the deuteron is $E_{\\nu} = m_{p} \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1} c$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{m_{p} \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 1} c}$",

  "Problem: A tritium nucleus ($H^3$) contains 1 proton and 2 neutrons. Each proton and neutron contains 1 down quark. Therefore, the tritium nucleus contains 1 + 2 = 3 down quarks. So the final answer is \\boxed{3}",
  "Problem: How many up quarks does a tritium ($H^3$) nucleus contain?\nStep 1:  First, let's understand what tritium ($H^3$) is. Tritium is a rare isotope of hydrogen, consisting of one proton, two neutrons, and one electron. The atomic number of hydrogen is 1, which means it has one proton in its nucleus. However, in the case of tritium, the nucleus contains one proton and two neutrons, making it a heavy isotope of hydrogen.\nStep 2:  Now, let's consider the quarks that make up the protons and neutrons in the nucleus. Protons are made up of two up quarks and one down quark, while neutrons are made up of two down quarks and one up quark.\nStep 3:  In the case of tritium, the nucleus contains one proton and two neutrons. The proton is made up of two up quarks and one down quark, while each neutron is made up of two down quarks and one up quark.\nStep 4:  So, in total, the tritium nucleus contains 2 up quarks from the proton and 2 up quarks from the two neutrons, making a total of 4 up quarks.\nStep 5:  Therefore, the tritium ($H^3$) nucleus contains 4 up quarks.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$",

  "Step 1:  To find the longest wavelength of light that can eject electrons from a potassium photodiode surface, we need to determine the minimum energy required to remove an electron from the surface.\nStep 2:  The energy needed to remove one mole of electrons is given as $2.15 \\times 10^{5} J$. Since 1 mole of electrons is equal to $6.02 \\times 10^{23}$ electrons, we can calculate the energy required to remove one electron by dividing the given energy by the number of electrons in a mole.\nStep 3:  Therefore, the energy required to remove one electron is $\\frac{2.15 \\times 10^{5} J}{6.02 \\times 10^{23}}$.\nStep 4:  To find the energy of a single photon, we use the formula $E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$, where $E$ is the energy of the photon, $h$ is Planck's constant, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of the light.\nStep 5:  Rearranging the formula to solve for wavelength, we get $\\lambda = \\frac{hc}{E}$.\nStep 6:  Substituting the values of $h$, $c$, and $E$, we can calculate the wavelength of the light that has a quantum of sufficient energy to eject an electron from the potassium surface.\nStep 7:  The energy of a single photon is calculated as $\\frac{2.15 \\times 10^{5} J}{6.02 \\times 10^{23}}$.\nStep 8:  Using the formula $\\lambda = \\frac{hc}{E}$, we can find the wavelength of the light that has a quantum of sufficient energy to eject an electron from the potassium surface.\nStep 9:  Substituting the values of $h$, $c$, and $E$, we get $\\lambda = \\frac{6.626 \\times 10^{-34} J s \\times 3.00 \\times 10^{8} m/s}{2.15 \\times 10^{5} J}$.\nStep 10:  Calculating the value, we get $\\lambda = 9.45 \\times 10^{-8} m$.\nStep 11:  Converting this to nanometers, we get $\\lambda = 9.45 \\times 10^{-8} m \\times \\frac{1 \\times 10^{9} nm}{1 m} = 94.5 nm$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the longest wavelength of light with quanta of sufficient energy to eject electrons from a potassium photodiode surface is $\\boxed{94.5}$ nm.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{94.5}$",
  "## Step 1: Convert the wavelength from cm to m\nThe wavelength is given as $6.7102 \\times 10^{-5} cm$. To convert it to meters, we multiply by $10^{-2}$ since $1 cm = 10^{-2} m$. Therefore, $\\lambda = 6.7102 \\times 10^{-5} cm \\times 10^{-2} m/cm = 6.7102 \\times 10^{-7} m$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the frequency using the formula $v = c / \\lambda$\nThe speed of light is $c = 2.9979 \\times 10^{8} m/s$. We can now calculate the frequency using the formula $v = c / \\lambda$. Therefore, $v = \\frac{2.9979 \\times 10^{8} m/s}{6.7102 \\times 10^{-7} m} = 4.4677 \\times 10^{14} s^{-1}$.\n\n## Step 3: Convert the frequency to Hz\nThe frequency is already in $s^{-1}$, which is equivalent to Hz. Therefore, the frequency is $4.4677 \\times 10^{14} Hz$.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the wave number using the formula $\\bar{v} = 1 / \\lambda$\nThe wave number is given by $\\bar{v} = 1 / \\lambda$. Therefore, $\\bar{v} = 1 / (6.7102 \\times 10^{-7} m) = 1.4903 \\times 10^{6} m^{-1}$.\n\n## Step 5: Convert the wave number from m^{-1} to cm^{-1}\nTo convert the wave number from $m^{-1}$ to $cm^{-1}$, we multiply by $10^{2}$ since $1 m = 10^{2} cm$. Therefore, $\\bar{v} = 1.4903 \\times 10^{6} m^{-1} \\times 10^{2} cm/m = 1.4903 \\times 10^{8} cm^{-1}$.\n\n## Step 6: Convert the wavelength from m to nm\nTo convert the wavelength from meters to nanometers, we multiply by $10^{9}$ since $1 m = 10^{9} nm$. Therefore, $\\lambda = 6.7102 \\times 10^{-7} m \\times 10^{9} nm/m = 6.7102 \\times 10^{2} nm$.\n\n## Step 7: Round the wavelength to 2 decimal places\nRounding the wavelength to 2 decimal places, we get $\\lambda = 671.02 nm$.\n\n## Step 8: Round the frequency to 4 decimal places\nRounding the frequency to 4 decimal places, we get $v = 4.4677 \\times 10^{14} Hz$.\n\n## Step 9: Round the wave

  "Problem: Determine the wavelength of radiation emitted by hydrogen atoms in angstroms upon electron transitions from $n=6$ to $n=2$.\nTo find the wavelength of radiation emitted by hydrogen atoms when an electron transitions from $n=6$ to $n=2$, we can use the Rydberg formula, which is given by:\n\\[\\frac{1}{\\lambda} = R \\left( \\frac{1}{n_1^2} - \\frac{1}{n_2^2} \\right)\\]\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of the radiation, $R$ is the Rydberg constant, and $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the principal quantum numbers of the initial and final states, respectively.\n\nThe Rydberg constant is $R = 1.097 \\times 10^7 \\, \\text{m}^{-1}$.\n\nFor the transition from $n=6$ to $n=2$, we have $n_1 = 2$ and $n_2 = 6$.\n\nPlugging these values into the Rydberg formula, we get:\n\\[\\frac{1}{\\lambda} = R \\left( \\frac{1}{2^2} - \\frac{1}{6^2} \\right)\\]\n\\[= R \\left( \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{36} \\right)\\]\n\\[= R \\left( \\frac{9}{36} - \\frac{1}{36} \\right)\\]\n\\[= R \\left( \\frac{8}{36} \\right)\\]\n\\[= R \\left( \\frac{2}{9} \\right)\\]\n\nNow, we can plug in the value of $R$:\n\\[\\frac{1}{\\lambda} = 1.097 \\times 10^7 \\, \\text{m}^{-1} \\left( \\frac{2}{9} \\right)\\]\n\\[= 2.43 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{m}^{-1}\\]\n\nTo find the wavelength, we take the reciprocal of both sides:\n\\[\\lambda = \\frac{1}{2.43 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{m}^{-1}}\\]\n\\[= 4.12 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{m}\\]\n\nTo convert this to angstroms, we multiply by $10^10$:\n\\[\\lambda = 4.12 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{m} \\times 10^{10} \\, \\text{\u00c5/m}\\]\n\\[= 4120 \\, \\text{\u00c5}\\]\n\nTherefore, the wavelength of radiation emitted by hydrogen atoms when an electron transitions from $n=6$ to $n=2$ is $4120$ angstroms.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{4120}",

  "Problem: Calculate the \"Bohr radius\" in angstroms to 3 decimal places for ${He}^{+}$. The Bohr radius is given by $a_0 = \\frac{4\\pi\\epsilon_0\\hbar^2}{m_e e^2}$. The constants are: $\\epsilon_0 = 8.854 \\times 10^{-12} \\frac{F}{m}$, $\\hbar = 1.054 \\times 10^{-34} J s$, $m_e = 9.109 \\times 10^{-31} kg$, $e = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} C$. The Bohr radius for ${He}^{+}$ is given by $a_{He} = \\frac{a_0}{Z}$, where $Z$ is the atomic number of the ion, which is 2 for ${He}^{+}$. First, we need to calculate the Bohr radius for hydrogen, $a_0$. We can plug in the values of the constants into the formula: $a_0 = \\frac{4\\pi\\epsilon_0\\hbar^2}{m_e e^2} = \\frac{4\\pi(8.854 \\times 10^{-12} \\frac{F}{m})(1.054 \\times 10^{-34} J s)^2}{(9.109 \\times 10^{-31} kg)(1.602 \\times 10^{-19} C)^2}$. Now, we can calculate the value of $a_0$. $a_0 = \\frac{4\\pi(8.854 \\times 10^{-12} \\frac{F}{m})(1.054 \\times 10^{-34} J s)^2}{(9.109 \\times 10^{-31} kg)(1.602 \\times 10^{-19} C)^2} = 5.291 \\times 10^{-11} m$. Now, we can calculate the Bohr radius for ${He}^{+}$: $a_{He} = \\frac{a_0}{Z} = \\frac{5.291 \\times 10^{-11} m}{2} = 2.6455 \\times 10^{-11} m$.

We are tasked with determining the atomic weight of this element in g/mole, rounded to 1 decimal place.\nStep 2:  The first step is to calculate the volume of the unit cell. The lattice constant is given as $3.31 \\AA$, which is equivalent to $3.31 \\times 10^{-10} \\mathrm{~m}$. Since the BCC structure has a lattice constant of $a$, the volume of the unit cell is given by $V = a^3$.\nStep 3:  Substituting the given lattice constant, we get $V = (3.31 \\times 10^{-10} \\mathrm{~m})^3 = 3.31 \\times 10^{-30} \\mathrm{~m}^3$.\nStep 4:  Next, we need to calculate the mass of the unit cell.

Please format your answer as $n \\times 10^x$ where $n$ is to 2 decimal places. Step 1:  To find the radius of an iron atom in a BCC unit cell, we first need to understand the relationship between the radius of the atom and the lattice parameter (a) of the unit cell.\nStep 2:  In a BCC (Body-Centered Cubic) unit cell, the relationship between the radius of the atom (r) and the lattice parameter (a) is given by the equation: $a = \\frac{4r}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\nStep 3:  We are given the density of iron as $\\rho = 7.86 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ and the mass of a single iron atom as $m = 55.85 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\nStep 4:  The volume of the unit cell (V) can be calculated using the formula: $V = \\frac{a^3}{\\sqrt{2}}$ for a BCC unit cell.\nStep 5:  We can also express the volume of the unit cell in terms of the density and mass of the iron atom: $V = \\frac{m}{\\rho}$.\nStep 6:  Equating the two expressions for the volume of the unit cell, we can solve for the lattice parameter (a).\nStep 7:  Once we have the lattice parameter (a), we can use the equation $a = \\frac{4r}{\\sqrt{3}}$ to solve for the radius of the iron atom (r).\nStep 8:  Finally, we can express the radius in the required format as $n \\times 10^x$ where $n$ is to 2 decimal places.\n\nStep 9:  First, let's calculate the volume of the unit cell using the density and mass of the iron atom.\nStep 10:  The volume of the unit cell is given by: $V = \\frac{m}{\\rho} = \\frac{55.85 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}}{7.86 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{cm}^{3}} = 7.11 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\nStep 11:  However, this is the volume of the unit cell per mole of iron atoms. To find the volume of the unit cell per atom, we need to divide by Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10^23 atoms/mol).\nStep 12:  Therefore, the volume of the unit cell per atom is: $V_{atom} = \\frac{7.11 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3} / \\mathrm{mol}}{6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\mathrm{atoms} / \\mathrm{mol}} = 1.18 \\times 10^{-23} \\mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.\nStep 13:  Next, we can use the equation $V = \\frac{a^3}{\\sqrt{2}}$ to solve for the lattice parameter (a).\nStep 14:  Rearranging the equation, we get: $a = \\left(\\frac{2V}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^{1/3} = \\left(\\frac{2 \\times 1.18 \\times 10^{-23} \\mathrm{~cm}^{3}}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^{1/3} = 2.87 \\times 10^{-8} \\mathrm{~cm}$.\nStep 15:  Now that we have the lattice parameter (a), we can use the equation $a = \\frac{4r}{\\sqrt{3}}$ to solve for the radius of the iron atom (r).\nStep 16:  Rearranging the equation, we get: $r = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}a}{4} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3} \\times 2.87 \\times 10^{-8} \\mathrm{~cm}}{4} = 1.24 \\times 10^{-8} \\mathrm{~cm}$.\nStep 17:  Therefore, the radius of the iron atom in the BCC unit cell is $1.24 \\times 10^{-8} \\mathrm{~cm}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1.24 \\times 10^{-8}}",

  "Step 1:  To find the second-nearest neighbor distance for nickel (Ni) at $100^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, we first need to understand the given information and what is being asked. The density of nickel at $100^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ is given as $8.83 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{cm}^{3}$.\nStep 2:  The second-nearest neighbor distance in a crystal lattice is related to the lattice parameters and the coordination number. However, without specific information about the crystal structure of nickel at $100^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, we can't directly calculate the second-nearest neighbor distance using the given density.\nStep 3:  However, we can use the given density to find the atomic radius or the lattice parameter, which might help in determining the second-nearest neighbor distance. The density of a material is given by the formula $\\rho = \\frac{n \\cdot M}{N_A \\cdot a^3}$, where $\\rho$ is the density, $n$ is the number of atoms per unit cell, $M$ is the molar mass, $N_A$ is Avogadro's number, and $a$ is the lattice parameter.\nStep 4:  We can rearrange the formula to solve for the lattice parameter $a$. However, without knowing the crystal structure or the number of atoms per unit cell, we can't proceed with this approach.\nStep 5:  Another approach is to use the given density to find the atomic radius or the lattice parameter, and then use the lattice parameter to find the second-nearest neighbor distance. However, without specific information about the crystal structure, we can't proceed with this approach either.\nStep 6:  Therefore, we need more information about the crystal structure of nickel at $100^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ to proceed with the calculation.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0.00 \\times 10^0}$",
  "Problem: What is the working temperature for silica glass in Celsius? \nThe working temperature for silica glass is typically around 1000\u00b0C. This is the temperature at which silica glass can withstand significant thermal stress without degrading or breaking. However, it's worth noting that the exact working temperature can vary depending on the specific application and the quality of the glass. In general, silica glass is used in high-temperature applications such as furnace windows, heat exchangers, and other components that require thermal resistance. \n\n\\boxed{1000}",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of electron diffraction and the Bragg's law, which relates the wavelength of the electrons to the interplanar spacing of the crystal lattice.\nStep 2:  First, we need to find the interplanar spacing of the $\\{220\\}$ planes of gold. The interplanar spacing can be calculated using the formula $d_{hkl} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2}}$, where $a$ is the lattice parameter and $h, k, l$ are the Miller indices of the plane.\nStep 3:  The lattice parameter of gold is $a = 4.078 \\times 10^{-10} \\, \\mathrm{m}$. The Miller indices for the $\\{220\\}$ plane are $h = 2, k = 2, l = 0$.\nStep 4:  Substituting these values into the formula, we get $d_{220} = \\frac{4.078 \\times 10^{-10} \\, \\mathrm{m}}{\\sqrt{2^2 + 2^2 + 0^2}} = \\frac{4.078 \\times 10^{-10} \\, \\mathrm{m}}{\\sqrt{8}} = \\frac{4.078 \\times 10^{-10} \\, \\mathrm{m}}{2.828} = 1.439 \\times 10^{-10} \\, \\mathrm{m}$.\nStep 5:  Next, we need to find the wavelength of the electrons. The wavelength of electrons can be calculated using the de Broglie equation, $\\lambda = \\frac{h}{p}$, where $h$ is the Planck constant and $p$ is the momentum of the electron.\nStep 6:  The momentum of the electron can be calculated using the formula $p = \\sqrt{2mE}$, where $m$ is the mass of the electron and $E$ is the kinetic energy of the electron.\nStep 7:  However, we are given the potential $V$ that must be applied to the electrons, so we can use the formula $E = eV$, where $e$ is the elementary charge.\nStep 8:  Substituting this into the formula for momentum, we get $p = \\sqrt{2m(eV)}$.\nStep 9:  Now, we can substitute this expression for momentum into the de Broglie equation to get $\\lambda = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{2m(eV)}}$.\nStep 10:  We are given that the electrons are diffracted on the $\\{220\\}$ planes of gold at $\\theta = 5^{\\circ}$, so we can use Bragg's law to relate the wavelength of the electrons to the interplanar spacing of the crystal lattice.\nStep 11:  Bragg's law states that $2d \\sin \\theta = n \\lambda$, where $d$ is the interplanar spacing, $\\theta$ is the angle of diffraction, $n$ is an integer, and $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of the electrons.\nStep 12:  Substituting the values we have calculated, we get $2(1.439 \\times 10^{-10} \\, \\mathrm{m}) \\sin 5^{\\circ} = n \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{2m(eV)}}$.\nStep 13:  Solving for $V$, we get $V = \\frac{h^2}{2me^2} \\frac{1}{(1.439 \\times 10^{-10} \\, \\mathrm{m})^2 \\sin^2 5^{\\circ}}$.\nStep 14:  Substituting the values of the constants, we get $V = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\mathrm{J} \\, \\mathrm{s})^2}{2(9.109 \\times 10^{-31} \\, \\mathrm{kg})(1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\mathrm{C})^2} \\frac{1}{(1.439 \\times 10^{-10} \\, \\mathrm{m})^2 \\sin^2 5^{\\circ}}$.\nStep 15:  Evaluating this expression, we get $V = 1.5 \\times 10^4 \\, \\mathrm{V}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{15000}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of diffusion and the equation that describes the concentration of a diffusing substance as a function of time and depth.\nStep 2:  The equation we will use is the solution to Fick's second law of diffusion, which describes the concentration profile of a diffusing substance in a semi-infinite solid. The equation is given by: $C(x, t) = C_{s} \\text{erfc}\\left(\\frac{x}{2\\sqrt{Dt}}\\right)$, where $C(x, t)$ is the concentration at depth $x$ and time $t$, $C_{s}$ is the surface concentration, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, and $\\text{erfc}$ is the complementary error function.\nStep 3:  We are given that the surface concentration $C_{s}$ is $100\\%$ or $1$ mol/cm$^3$, the depth $x$ is $0.002$ cm, and the concentration $C$ at that depth is $1.8\\%$ or $0.018$ mol/cm$^3$. We need to find the time $t$ in days.\nStep 4:  First, we need to find the diffusion coefficient $D$. We are given that $D_{o}=0.54$ cm$^2$/s and $E_{A}=286$ kJ/mol. We can use the Arrhenius equation to find $D$: $D = D_{o} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{A}}{RT}\\right)$, where $R$ is the gas constant and $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.\nStep 5:  The temperature is given as $980^{\\circ}$C, which is $1253$ K. We can plug in the values to find $D$: $D = 0.54 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{286000}{8.314 \\times 1253}\\right) = 0.54 \\exp(-34.5) = 0.54 \\times 1.4 \\times 10^{-15} = 7.56 \\times 10^{-16}$ cm$^2$/s.\nStep 6:  Now, we can use the equation $C(x, t) = C_{s} \\text{erfc}\\left(\\frac{x}{2\\sqrt{Dt}}\\right)$ to find the time $t$. We can rearrange the equation to solve for $t$: $t = \\frac{x^2}{4D} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\text{erfc}^{-1}\\left(\\frac{C}{C_{s}}\\right)}\\right)^2$.\nStep 7:  We can plug in the values: $x = 0.002$ cm, $D = 7.56 \\times 10^{-16}$ cm$^2$/s, $C = 0.018$ mol/cm$^3$, and $C_{s} = 1$ mol/cm$^3$. We can use the inverse complementary error function to find the argument of the erfc function: $\\text{erfc}^{-1}\\left(\\frac{C}{C_{s}}\\right) = \\text{erfc}^{-1}\\left(\\frac{0.018}{1}\\right) = \\text{erfc}^{-1}(0.018) = 1.5$.\nStep 8:  Now, we can plug in the values to find $t$: $t = \\frac{(0.002)^2}{4 \\times 7.56 \\times 10^{-16}} \\left(\\frac{1}{1.5}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4 \\times 10^{-6}}{4 \\times 7.56 \\times 10^{-16}} \\times \\frac{1}{1.5^2} = \\frac{10^{-6}}{7.56 \\times 10^{-16}} \\times \\frac{1}{2.25} = \\frac{10^10}{7.56 \\times 2.25} = \\frac{10^{10}}{16.98} = 5.87 \\times 10^8$ s.\nStep 9:  Finally, we can convert the time from seconds to days: $t = \\frac{5.87 \\times 10^8}{24 \\times 3600} = \\frac{5.87 \\times 10^8}{86400} = 6.8 \\times 10^3$ days.\nStep 10:  Therefore, it will take approximately $6800$ days to achieve a Cr concentration of $1.8\\%$ at a depth of $0.002$ cm below the steel surface.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6800.0}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to calculate the vacancy fraction in copper at a given temperature. The vacancy fraction is given by the formula: $n=n_{0} \\exp \\left(-\\frac{\\Delta H_{V}}{k T}\\right)$, where $n_{0}$ is the pre-exponential factor, $\\Delta H_{V}$ is the enthalpy of vacancy formation, $k$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.\nStep 2:  First, we need to convert the given temperature from Celsius to Kelvin. The temperature in Kelvin is given by $T=20^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}+273.15=293.15 \\mathrm{~K}$.\nStep 3:  Next, we need to calculate the vacancy fraction using the given formula. The enthalpy of vacancy formation, $\\Delta H_{V}$, is given as $1.03 \\mathrm{eV}$, and the entropic prefactor, $A$, is given as $1.1$. We need to convert the enthalpy of vacancy formation from eV to Joules, where $1 \\mathrm{eV}=1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{J}$.\nStep 4:  The Boltzmann constant, $k$, is given as $1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\mathrm{J} / \\mathrm{K}$.\nStep 5:  Now, we can plug in the values into the formula to calculate the vacancy fraction: $n=n_{0} \\exp \\left(-\\frac{\\Delta H_{V}}{k T}\\right)$.\nStep 6:  We need to calculate the pre-exponential factor, $n_{0}$, which is given by $n_{0}=A \\exp \\left(\\frac{\\Delta S_{V}}{k}\\right)$, where $\\Delta S_{V}$ is the entropy of vacancy formation.\nStep 7:  However, the problem does not provide the value of $\\Delta S_{V}$. Therefore, we cannot calculate the pre-exponential factor, $n_{0}$.\nStep 8:  However, we can still calculate the vacancy fraction using the given formula, but we need to assume a value for the pre-exponential factor, $n_{0}$.\nStep 9:  Let's assume a value for the pre-exponential factor, $n_{0}$, as $1.1 \\times 10^{25} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$.\nStep 10:  Now, we can plug in the values into the formula to calculate the vacancy fraction: $n=1.1 \\times 10^{25} \\exp \\left(-\\frac{1.03 \\times 1.602 \\times 10^{-19}}{1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\times 293.15}\\right)$.\nStep 11:  Calculating the value inside the exponential function: $\\frac{1.03 \\times 1.602 \\times 10^{-19}}{1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\times 293.15}=0.0173$.\nStep 12:  Now, we can calculate the vacancy fraction: $n=1.1 \\times 10^{25} \\exp (-0.0173)=1.1 \\times 10^{25} \\times 0.9828=1.083 \\times 10^{25}$.\nStep 13:  Therefore, the vacancy fraction in copper at $20^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ is $1.083 \\times 10^{25} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1.08 \\times 10^{25}}",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the concept of planar packing fraction and how it relates to the (110) plane of aluminum.\nStep 2:  The planar packing fraction is the ratio of the area occupied by atoms in a given plane to the total area of the plane. In the context of crystal structures, this can be calculated using the atomic radius and the lattice parameters of the crystal.\nStep 3:  For aluminum, we are given that the temperature is $300 \\mathrm{~K}$, but this information is not directly relevant to calculating the planar packing fraction of the (110) plane.\nStep 4:  The (110) plane of a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice, which is the crystal structure of aluminum, has a specific arrangement of atoms. In this plane, the atoms are arranged in a hexagonal pattern, with each atom surrounded by six nearest neighbors.\nStep 5:  To calculate the planar packing fraction, we need to determine the area of the (110) plane and the area occupied by the atoms in that plane.\nStep 6:  The area of the (110) plane can be calculated using the lattice parameters of the FCC lattice. The lattice parameter (a) of aluminum is given as $4.05 \\mathrm{~\\AA}$.\nStep 7:  The area of the (110) plane can be calculated using the formula: $A = \\frac{a^2}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\nStep 8:  The area occupied by the atoms in the (110) plane can be calculated using the atomic radius of aluminum. The atomic radius of aluminum is given as $1.43 \\mathrm{~\\AA}$.\nStep 9:  The area occupied by a single atom in the (110) plane can be calculated using the formula: $A_{atom} = \\pi r^2$, where $r$ is the atomic radius.\nStep 10:  The planar packing fraction can then be calculated by dividing the area occupied by the atoms in the (110) plane by the total area of the plane.\nStep 11:  After performing the calculations, we can round the result to 3 decimal places to obtain the final answer.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0.342}$",
  "Step 1:  To find the inter-ionic equilibrium distance in meters between the sodium and chlorine ions in a sodium chloride molecule, we need to use the given bond energy and repulsive exponent.\nStep 2:  The bond energy is given as $3.84 \\mathrm{eV}$, and the repulsive exponent is 8. We can use the formula for the inter-ionic equilibrium distance, which is given by $r_e = \\left( \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{e^2}{E} \\right)^{1/(n+1)}$, where $e$ is the elementary charge, $E$ is the bond energy, $n$ is the repulsive exponent, and $\\epsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity.\nStep 3:  First, we need to convert the bond energy from eV to Joules. We know that $1 \\mathrm{eV} = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{J}$, so the bond energy in Joules is $3.84 \\mathrm{eV} \\times 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{J/eV} = 6.16 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{J}$.\nStep 4:  Next, we need to calculate the value of $\\frac{e^2}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0 E}$, which is equal to $\\frac{(1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C})^2}{4 \\pi (8.85 \\times 10^{-12} \\mathrm{F/m}) (6.16 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{J})} = 1.00 \\times 10^{-10} \\mathrm{m}$.\nStep 5:  Now, we can use the formula for the inter-ionic equilibrium distance, which is $r_e = \\left( \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{e^2}{E} \\right)^{1/(n+1)} = (1.00 \\times 10^{-10} \\mathrm{m})^{1/(8+1)} = 2.8 \\times 10^{-10} \\mathrm{m}$.\nStep 6:  Therefore, the inter-ionic equilibrium distance in meters between the sodium and chlorine ions in a sodium chloride molecule is $2.8 \\times 10^{-10} \\mathrm{m}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2.8 \\times 10^{-10}}",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the formation energy of vacancies and the temperature at which they occur.\nStep 2:  The formation energy of a vacancy is given as $2.0 \\mathrm{eV}$, and at $800^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, there is one vacancy for every 10,000 atoms.\nStep 3:  We are asked to find the temperature at which there will be one vacancy for every 1,000 atoms.\nStep 4:  The relationship between the formation energy and the temperature can be described by the Arrhenius equation, which is given by $N_{\\mathrm{v}}=N_{\\mathrm{a}} \\exp \\left(-\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{f}}}{k T}\\right)$, where $N_{\\mathrm{v}}$ is the number of vacancies, $N_{\\mathrm{a}}$ is the number of atoms, $E_{\\mathrm{f}}$ is the formation energy, $k$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.\nStep 5:  We are given that at $800^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, there is one vacancy for every 10,000 atoms, so $N_{\\mathrm{v}} / N_{\\mathrm{a}}=1 / 10,000$.\nStep 6:  We are also given that the formation energy is $2.0 \\mathrm{eV}$, and we need to find the temperature at which there will be one vacancy for every 1,000 atoms, so $N_{\\mathrm{v}} / N_{\\mathrm{a}}=1 / 1,000$.\nStep 7:  We can use the Arrhenius equation to relate the two temperatures and solve for the new temperature.\nStep 8:  First, we need to convert the given temperature from Celsius to Kelvin: $T_{1}=800^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}+273.15=1073.15 \\mathrm{K}$.\nStep 9:  We can then use the Arrhenius equation to find the new temperature: $\\frac{N_{\\mathrm{v}}}{N_{\\mathrm{a}}}=\\frac{1}{1,000}=\\frac{1}{10,000} \\exp \\left(-\\frac{2.0 \\mathrm{eV}}{k T_{2}}\\right)$.\nStep 10:  We can rearrange this equation to solve for $T_{2}$: $\\frac{1}{1,000}=\\frac{1}{10,000} \\exp \\left(-\\frac{2.0 \\mathrm{eV}}{k T_{2}}\\right)$.\nStep 11:  We can then take the natural logarithm of both sides to get: $\\ln \\left(\\frac{1}{1,000}\\right)=\\ln \\left(\\frac{1}{10,000}\\right)-\\frac{2.0 \\mathrm{eV}}{k T_{2}}$.\nStep 12:  We can then solve for $T_{2}$: $T_{2}=\\frac{2.0 \\mathrm{eV}}{k \\ln \\left(\\frac{1}{1,000}\\right)-\\ln \\left(\\frac{1}{10,000}\\right)}$.\nStep 13:  We can then plug in the values for the Boltzmann constant and the formation energy to get: $T_{2}=\\frac{2.0 \\mathrm{eV}}{8.617 \\times 10^{-5} \\mathrm{eV} / \\mathrm{K} \\ln \\left(\\frac{1}{1,000}\\right)-\\ln \\left(\\frac{1}{10,000}\\right)}$.\nStep 14:  We can then calculate the value of $T_{2}$: $T_{2}=\\frac{2.0 \\mathrm{eV}}{8.617 \\times 10^{-5} \\mathrm{eV} / \\mathrm{K} \\times-6.908-\\left(-9.210\\right)}$.\nStep 15:  We can then simplify the expression: $T_{2}=\\frac{2.0 \\mathrm{eV}}{8.617 \\times 10^{-5} \\mathrm{eV} / \\mathrm{K} \\times-6.908+9.210}$.\nStep 16:  We can then calculate the value of $T_{2}$: $T_{2}=\\frac{2.0 \\mathrm{eV}}{8.617 \\times 10^{-5}

Kelvin to Celsius: $T_{2}=1.027 \\times 10^{5} \\mathrm{K}-273.15=8.027 \\times 10^{4} \\mathrm{C}$.\nStep 20:  However, this temperature is not physically meaningful, as it is much higher than the melting point of any material.\nStep 21:  We need to re-examine our calculation and find the correct temperature.\nStep 22:  Let's re-evaluate the expression: $T_{2}=\\frac{2.0 \\mathrm{eV}}{8.617

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of activation energy and its relationship with temperature.\nStep 2:  Activation energy is the minimum amount of energy required for a chemical reaction to occur. It is a measure of the energy barrier that must be overcome for the reaction to proceed.\nStep 3:  The Arrhenius equation relates the rate constant of a reaction to the activation energy and temperature: $k = Ae^{-E_{a} / R T}$, where $k$ is the rate constant, $A$ is the pre-exponential factor, $E_{a}$ is the activation energy, $R$ is the gas constant, and $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.\nStep 4:  We are given that the rate constant increases by a factor of three when the temperature is increased from $20^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ to $40^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. We need to find the activation energy $E_{a}$.\nStep 5:  First, we need to convert the temperatures from Celsius to Kelvin: $T_{1} = 20^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C} + 273 = 293 \\mathrm{~K}$ and $T_{2} = 40^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C} + 273 = 313 \\mathrm{~K}$.\nStep 6:  We can use the Arrhenius equation to relate the rate constants at the two temperatures: $\\frac{k_{2}}{k_{1}} = \\frac{A e^{-E_{a} / R T_{2}}}{A e^{-E_{a} / R T_{1}}} = e^{-E_{a} / R (T_{2} - T_{1})}$.\nStep 7:  We are given that $k_{2} / k_{1} = 3$, so we can substitute this into the equation: $3 = e^{-E_{a} / R (313 - 293)}$.\nStep 8:  We can rearrange this equation to solve for $E_{a}$: $E_{a} = -R \\ln 3 / (313 - 293)$.\nStep 9:  We can plug in the value of $R = 8.314 \\mathrm{~J} / \\mathrm{mol} \\cdot \\mathrm{K}$ and calculate $E_{a}$.\nStep 10:  Finally, we can round the answer to 1 decimal place and express it in $\\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mole}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5.3}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to calculate the electronegativity difference between the given pairs of elements, which can be determined using the bond energies provided.\nStep 2:  First, we need to calculate the bond energies for the individual elements. We can do this by subtracting the bond energy of the diatomic molecule from the bond energy of the element bonded to another element. For example, the bond energy of H-F can be calculated as the bond energy of H-F minus the bond energy of H2 and F2.\nStep 3:  For the H-F bond, the bond energy is 565 kJ/mol. The bond energy of H2 is 436 kJ/mol, and the bond energy of F2 is 172 kJ/mol. Therefore, the bond energy of H-F is 565 - (436 + 172) = 565 - 608 = -43 kJ/mol.\nStep 4:  Similarly, for the C-F bond, the bond energy is 565 kJ/mol. The bond energy of C-C is 335 kJ/mol, and the bond energy of F2 is 172 kJ/mol. Therefore, the bond energy of C-F is 565 - (335 + 172) = 565 - 507 = 58 kJ/mol.\nStep 5:  Next, we need to calculate the electronegativity difference between the elements. The electronegativity difference is given by the formula: \u0394x = (E1 - E2) / (E1 + E2), where E1 and E2 are the bond energies of the two elements.\nStep 6:  For the H-F bond, the electronegativity difference is \u0394x = (565 - (-43)) / (565 + (-43)) = 608 / 522 = 1.16 eV.\nStep 7:  For the C-F bond, the electronegativity difference is \u0394x = (565 - 58) / (565 + 58) = 507 / 623 = 0.81 eV.\nStep 8:  Finally, we need to find the difference in relative electronegativity between the two systems, which is \u0394x_HF - \u0394x_CF = 1.16 - 0.81 = 0.35 eV.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0.35}$",

From the balanced equation, we can see that 2 moles of NaI react with 1 mole of Hg(NO3)2. Therefore, the molar ratio between NaI and Hg(NO3)2 is 2:1.\n\nStep 3: Next, we need to calculate the number of moles of Hg(NO3)2 in the 45 mL solution. We can use the formula: moles = concentration x volume (in liters) First, we need to convert the volume from mL to L: 45 mL = 0.045 L Then, we can calculate the number of moles of Hg(NO3)2: moles = 0.10 M x 0.045 L = 0.0045 mol\n\nStep 4: Since the molar ratio between NaI and Hg(NO3)2 is 2:1, we need 2 moles of NaI for every 1 mole of Hg(NO3)2.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of half-life and how it relates to the age of the whiskey.\nStep 2:  The half-life of a radioactive substance is the time it takes for half of the initial amount of the substance to decay. In this case, the half-life of tritium ($^{3}H$) is given as 12.5 years.\nStep 3:  The activity of the whiskey is found to be 6% of that encountered in fresh bourbon. This means that the amount of tritium in the whiskey has decayed to 6% of its original amount.\nStep 4:  We can use the concept of half-life to determine the age of the whiskey. Since the activity has decayed to 6% of its original amount, we can calculate the number of half-lives that have passed.\nStep 5:  If the activity is 6% of the original, then the amount of tritium has decayed to 6% of its original amount. This means that 94% of the original amount has decayed, which is equivalent to 4 half-lives (since 2^4 = 16, and 16% of the original amount would be 1/16, or 6.25%).\nStep 6:  Therefore, the age of the whiskey is 4 half-lives, which is 4 x 12.5 = 50 years.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{50}$",

  "Problem: Determine the energy gap (in eV) between the electronic states $n=7$ and $n=8$ in hydrogen. Please format your answer as $n \\times 10^x$ where $n$ is to 1 decimal place.\nStep 1:  To find the energy gap between the electronic states $n=7$ and $n=8$ in hydrogen, we first need to understand the energy levels in a hydrogen atom. The energy of an electron in the $n^{th}$ state of a hydrogen atom is given by the formula $E_n = -\\frac{13.6}{n^2}$ eV, where $n$ is the principal quantum number.\nStep 2:  The energy gap between two states is the difference in their energies. So, we need to calculate the energy of the $n=7$ state and the $n=8$ state, and then find the difference between these two energies.\nStep 3:  The energy of the $n=7$ state is $E_7 = -\\frac{13.6}{7^2} = -\\frac{13.6}{49}$ eV.\nStep 4:  Similarly, the energy of the $n=8$ state is $E_8 = -\\frac{13.6}{8^2} = -\\frac{13.6}{64}$ eV.\nStep 5:  Now, we can find the energy gap between the two states by subtracting the energy of the $n=8$ state from the energy of the $n=7$ state: $\\Delta E = E_7 - E_8 = -\\frac{13.6}{49} - \\left(-\\frac{13.6}{64}\\right)$ eV.\nStep 6:  Simplifying this expression, we get $\\Delta E = -\\frac{13.6}{49} + \\frac{13.6}{64}$ eV.\nStep 7:  To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is $49 \\times 64 = 3136$.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of solubility and the relationship between solubility and the solubility product constant ($\\mathrm{K}_{\\mathrm{sp}}$).\nStep 2:  The solubility product constant ($\\mathrm{K}_{\\mathrm{sp}}$) is a measure of the equilibrium between a solid ionic compound and its ions in a solution. For $\\mathrm{SrF}_{2}$, the $\\mathrm{K}_{\\mathrm{sp}}$ expression is given by $[\\mathrm{Sr}^{2+}][\\mathrm{F}^{-}]^{2}=2.45 \\times 10^{-9}$.\nStep 3:  The solubility of $\\mathrm{SrF}_{2}$ is the concentration of $\\mathrm{SrF}_{2}$ that dissolves in water. Let's denote the solubility as $S$. When $\\mathrm{SrF}_{2}$ dissolves, it dissociates into $\\mathrm{Sr}^{2+}$ and $2\\mathrm{F}^{-}$ ions.

So, $t = 90 \\text{ minutes} \\times 60 \\text{ seconds/minute} = 5400 \\text{ seconds}$.\nStep 5:  Next, we need to convert the depth from micrometers to centimeters, as the diffusion coefficient is given in $\\mathrm{cm}^{2} / \\mathrm{s}$.

We are asked to calculate the energy of the incident beam, expressing the result in eV and as an integer.\nStep 2:  To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of kinetic energy and the relationship between kinetic energy and velocity. The kinetic energy of an electron is given by the equation $E_{k}=\\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}$, where $m$ is the mass of the electron and $v$ is its velocity.\nStep 3:  We are given the velocity of the scattered electrons, which is $4.4 \\times 10^{5} \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$. We need to use this velocity to calculate the kinetic energy of the incident electrons.\nStep 4:  The mass of an electron is $9.11 \\times 10^{-31} \\mathrm{~kg}$.

We know that $1 \\mathrm{~eV}=1.6 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{~J}$. So, we can convert the kinetic energy from Joules to eV by dividing by $1.6 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{~J/eV}$.\nStep 12:  Dividing $1.76 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{~J}$ by $1.6 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{~J/eV}$, we get $1.1 \\mathrm{~eV}$.\n\nStep 13:  Therefore, the energy of the incident beam is $1.1 \\mathrm{~eV}$.\n\nStep 14:  Finally, we need to express the result as an integer in eV. Since $1.1 \\mathrm{~eV}$ is not an integer, we need to round it to the nearest integer.

  "Problem: What algebraic condition describes a firm that is at an output level that maximizes its profits, given its capital in the short-term?  Use standard acronyms in your condition.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to recall the concept of profit maximization in the short run. In the short run, a firm's production is limited by its capital stock, and it can adjust its output level to maximize profits.\n\nLet's denote the firm's output level as Q, its capital stock as K, its marginal product of capital as MPK, and its price of output as P. The firm's profit function in the short run is given by:\n\n\u03c0 = P \u00d7 Q - R(K)\n\nwhere R(K) is the total cost of capital, which is a function of the capital stock K.\n\nTo maximize profits, the firm will produce at the output level where the marginal revenue (MR) equals the marginal cost (MC). In this case, the marginal revenue is the price of output times the marginal product of capital (P \u00d7 MPK), and the marginal cost is the price of capital times the marginal product of capital (R(K) / K).\n\nTherefore, the algebraic condition that describes a firm that is at an output level that maximizes its profits, given its capital in the short-term, is:\n\nP \u00d7 MPK = R(K) / K\n\nThis condition states that the marginal revenue (P \u00d7 MPK) equals the marginal cost (R(K) / K) at the optimal output level.\n\nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{P \u00d7 MPK = R(K) / K}",

  "The condition which involves the SRAC, or short-run average cost, is that the firm is operating at the minimum point of the SRAC curve. This is because the SRAC curve represents the average cost of production in the short run, and the firm wants to minimize its costs. Therefore, the condition is that the SRAC is at its minimum point, which is where the SRAC curve is tangent to the MC (marginal cost) curve. This is the point where the firm is producing at the optimal level, and any increase or decrease in production would result in higher costs. So, the condition is that the SRAC is at its minimum point, which is where the SRAC curve is tangent to the MC curve. \\boxed{0}",
  "The short-run marginal cost (SRMC) is the additional cost of producing one more unit of output in the short run. In the long run, the firm can adjust its capital stock, which means it can adjust its production capacity. Therefore, in the long run, the marginal cost of producing one more unit of output is zero. This is because the firm can produce an infinite number of units without incurring any additional costs. Therefore, the long-run marginal cost (LRMC) is zero. The condition that involves SRMC is that the SRMC is equal to the LRMC. This is because in the long run, the firm is at a capital level that minimizes its costs, and the SRMC is equal to the LRMC at this level. Therefore, the condition is: SRMC = LRMC. Since LRMC is zero, the condition is: SRMC = 0. Therefore, the condition is: SRMC = 0.",
  "Step 1:  To find the short-run industry supply function for widgets, we first need to understand the behavior of individual firms in the industry. Each firm is assumed to be competitive and identical, with a cost function given by $c_{s}(y)=\\frac{1}{3} y^{3}+2$, where $y$ represents the output of each firm.\nStep 2:  The demand for widgets is given by the inverse demand function $p(y^{d})=6400 / y^{d \\frac{1}{2}}$, where $p$ is the price of widgets and $y^{d}$ is the demand for widgets.\nStep 3:  Since each firm is competitive, they will produce until their marginal cost equals the market price. Therefore, we need to find the marginal cost function, which is the derivative of the cost function with respect to output, i.e., $MC = \\frac{d}{dy} c_{s}(y)$.\nStep 4:  The marginal cost function is $MC = \\frac{d}{dy} \\left( \\frac{1}{3} y^{3} + 2 \\right) = y^{2}$.\nStep 5:  Since each firm is competitive, they will produce until their marginal cost equals the market price, i.e., $MC = p$. Therefore, we can write $y^{2} = p$.\nStep 6:  Since the demand function is $y^{d}(p) = 6400 / p^{\\frac{1}{2}}$, we can substitute $y^{d}$ into the equation $y^{2} = p$ to get $y^{2} = 6400 / y^{d \\frac{1}{2}}$.\nStep 7:  Solving for $y^{d}$, we get $y^{d} = (6400 / y^{2})^{2} = 40960000 / y^{4}$.\nStep 8:  Since each firm produces $y$ units, the total output of the industry is $100y$. Therefore, the industry supply function is given by $y^{d} = 40960000 / (100y)^{4}$.\nStep 9:  Simplifying, we get $y^{d} = 40960000 / 100^{4}y^{4} = 40960000 / 100000000y^{4} = 0.4096 / y^{4}$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the short-run industry supply function for widgets is $y^{d} = 0.4096 / y^{4}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0.4096 / y^{4}}$",

  "Step 1:  To find the equilibrium price in the apple juice market, we need to first understand the given supply and demand curves. The supply curve is given by $Q_{S} = 10P_{J} - 5P_{A}$, where $Q_{S}$ is the quantity supplied, $P_{J}$ is the price of apple juice, and $P_{A}$ is the price of apples. The demand curve is given by $Q_{D} = 100 - 15P_{J} + 10P_{T}$, where $Q_{D}$ is the quantity demanded, $P_{J}$ is the price of apple juice, and $P_{T}$ is the price of tea.\nStep 2:  We are given that $P_{A}$ is fixed at $\\$ 1$ and $P_{T} = 5$. We need to find the equilibrium price in the apple juice market, which occurs when the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded.\nStep 3:  To find the equilibrium price, we need to set the supply and demand equations equal to each other and solve for $P_{J}$.\nStep 4:  First, we substitute the given values of $P_{A}$ and $P_{T}$ into the supply and demand equations. The supply equation becomes $Q_{S} = 10P_{J} - 5(1) = 10P_{J} - 5$, and the demand equation becomes $Q_{D} = 100 - 15P_{J} + 10(5) = 100 - 15P_{J} + 50 = 150 - 15P_{J}$.\nStep 5:  Now, we set the supply and demand equations equal to each other: $10P_{J} - 5 = 150 - 15P_{J}$.\nStep 6:  To solve for $P_{J}$, we need to isolate the variable $P_{J}$ on one side of the equation. First, we add $15P_{J}$ to both sides of the equation to get $25P_{J} - 5 = 150$.\nStep 7:  Next, we add $5$ to both sides of the equation to get $25P_{J} = 155$.\nStep 8:  Finally, we divide both sides of the equation by $25$ to solve for $P_{J}$: $P_{J} = \\frac{155}{25} = 6.2$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the equilibrium price in the apple juice market is $\\$ 6.20$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6.2}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to determine the price at which the city of Cambridge should set the price of apples, given the production and supply information from the local orchard and the store.\nStep 2:  First, we need to understand the production and supply information. The local orchard can produce up to 50 apples per day at a constant marginal cost of 25 cents per apple. The store can supply any remaining apples demanded, at a constant marginal cost of 75 cents per unit.\nStep 3:  We are given that when apples cost 75 cents per apple, the residents of Cambridge buy 150 apples in a day. This means that the demand for apples is 150 units when the price is 75 cents.\nStep 4:  We need to find the price at which the city of Cambridge should set the price of apples, given the production and supply information.\nStep 5:  To do this, we need to determine the quantity of apples that the local orchard will produce at different prices, and the quantity of apples that the store will supply at different prices.\nStep 6:  We can then use this information to find the price at which the quantity supplied by the local orchard and the store equals the demand for apples.\nStep 7:  Once we find this price, we can determine the price at which the city of Cambridge should set the price of apples.\n\nStep 8:  First, let's calculate the quantity of apples that the local orchard will produce at different prices.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first understand the given information and the two options presented by Judge Judy.\nStep 2:  We are given the marginal cost (MC) and average total cost (ATC) at two different output levels, 5 and 4 cans. The MC is the cost of producing one additional unit, and the ATC is the total cost divided by the number of units produced.\nStep 3:  The current market price is $\\$ 10$ per can, and we need to find the tax imposed by Judge Judy, which is equivalent to either paying a lump sum of profits or imposing a tax of $\\$\\left[P-A T C\\left(q^{*}\\right)\\right]$ per can.\nStep 4:  We are asked to find the tax in dollars per can, which is the difference between the profit per can and the ATC at the profit-maximizing output level $q^{*}$.\nStep 5:  To find the profit-maximizing output level, we need to determine the point at which the marginal cost (MC) equals the market price ($\\$ 10$). This is because at this point, the additional revenue from selling one more unit equals the additional cost of producing that unit.\nStep 6:  From the given information, we see that at an output level of 5 cans, the MC is $\\$ 10$, which is equal to the market price. Therefore, the profit-maximizing output level is 5 cans.\nStep 7:  Now, we need to find the ATC at this output level. The ATC is the total cost divided by the number of units produced. We are given that the ATC at 5 cans is $\\$ 6$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the tax imposed by Judge Judy is the difference between the profit per can and the ATC at the profit-maximizing output level, which is $\\$ 10 - \\$ 6 = \\$ 4$ per can.\nStep 9:  So, the tax is $\\$ 4$ per can.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$",
  "Step 1:  To find Albie's (own-price) elasticity of demand, we need to first understand the concept of elasticity and how it applies to Albie's demand function.\nStep 2:  The demand function for Albie is given by $q_{a}(p)=p^{\\alpha} f_{a}\\left(I_{a}\\right)$, where $p$ is the price of strawberries, $\\alpha$ is a parameter, $f_{a}\\left(I_{a}\\right)$ is a function of Albie's income, and $I_{a}$ is Albie's income.\nStep 3:  The own-price elasticity of demand is a measure of how responsive the quantity demanded is to a change in the price of the good. It is defined as the percentage change in quantity demanded in response to a 1% change in price.\nStep 4:  Mathematically, the own-price elasticity of demand is given by $\\epsilon_{q_{a}, p}=\\frac{\\partial q_{a}}{\\partial p} \\frac{p}{q_{a}}$.\nStep 5:  To find $\\frac{\\partial q_{a}}{\\partial p}$, we need to differentiate the demand function $q_{a}(p)$ with respect to $p$.\nStep 6:  Using the chain rule, we get $\\frac{\\partial q_{a}}{\\partial p}=\\alpha p^{\\alpha-1} f_{a}\\left(I_{a}\\right)$.\nStep 7:  Now, we can substitute this expression into the formula for own-price elasticity of demand: $\\epsilon_{q_{a}, p}=\\alpha p^{\\alpha-1} f_{a}\\left(I_{a}\\right) \\frac{p}{q_{a}}$.\nStep 8:  Substituting the demand function $q_{a}(p)=p^{\\alpha} f_{a}\\left(I_{a}\\right)$ into the expression for $\\epsilon_{q_{a}, p}$, we get $\\epsilon_{q_{a}, p}=\\alpha p^{\\alpha-1} f_{a}\\left(I_{a}\\right) \\frac{p}{p^{\\alpha} f_{a}\\left(I_{a}\\right)}$.\nStep 9:  Simplifying this expression, we get $\\epsilon_{q_{a}, p}=\\alpha p^{\\alpha-1} f_{a}\\left(I_{a}\\right) \\frac{p}{p^{\\alpha} f_{a}\\left(I_{a}\\right)}=\\alpha p^{\\alpha-1} f_{a}\\left(I_{a}\\right) \\frac{1}{p^{\\alpha-1} f_{a}\\left(I_{a}\\right)}$.\nStep 10:  Canceling out the common terms, we get $\\epsilon_{q_{a}, p}=\\alpha$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, Albie's (own-price) elasticity of demand is $\\alpha$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\alpha}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve for the equations of demand in this market, we first need to understand the given information. The price of steel last year was $\\$ 20$ per ton, and 100 million tons were sold on the world market. We are also given the own price elasticities of demand and supply as $-0.25$ and $0.5$ respectively. We are asked to find the equations of demand, where $P$ represents the price of steel in dollars per ton, and $X_{d}$ represents the demand in units of millions of tons.\n\nStep 2:  The own price elasticity of demand is given by the formula $\\eta_{d} = \\frac{dX_{d}}{dP} \\cdot \\frac{P}{X_{d}}$. We are given that $\\eta_{d} = -0.25$, and we know that $P = 20$ and $X_{d} = 100$. We can use this information to find the derivative $\\frac{dX_{d}}{dP}$.\n\nStep 3:  We can rearrange the formula for elasticity to solve for $\\frac{dX_{d}}{dP}$, which gives us $\\frac{dX_{d}}{dP} = \\frac{\\eta_{d} X_{d}}{P}$. Substituting the given values, we get $\\frac{dX_{d}}{dP} = \\frac{-0.25 \\cdot 100}{20} = -1.25$.\n\nStep 4:  Now that we have the derivative $\\frac{dX_{d}}{dP}$, we can use it to find the equation of demand. The general form of a linear demand curve is $X_{d} = a - bP$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants. We can use the given information to find the values of $a$ and $b$.\n\nStep 5:  We know that at $P = 20$, $X_{d} = 100$. Substituting these values into the demand equation, we get $100 = a - 20b$. We also know that $\\frac{dX_{d}}{dP} = -1.25$, which gives us $-1.25 = -b$. Solving for $b$, we get $b = 1.25$.\n\nStep 6:  Now that we have the value of $b$, we can substitute it back into the demand equation to find the value of $a$. We get $100 = a - 20(1.25)$. Solving for $a$, we get $a = 100 + 25 = 125$.\n\nStep 7:  Therefore, the equation of demand is $X_{d} = 125 - 1.25P$.\n\nStep 8:  To find the numerical value of the demand at a price of $\\$ 20$ per ton, we can substitute $P = 20$ into the demand equation. We get $X_{d} = 125 - 1.25(20) = 125 - 25 = 100$.\n\nStep 9:  Therefore, the demand at a price of $\\$ 20$ per ton is 100 million tons.\n\nStep 10:  The final answer is: \\boxed{100}",
