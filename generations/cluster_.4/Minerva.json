  "Step 1:  First, let's understand the problem. We have two Magellan telescopes with a diameter of $6.5 \\mathrm{~m}$ each. In one configuration, the effective focal length is $72 \\mathrm{~m}$. We need to find the diameter of the image of a planet at this focus if the angular diameter of the planet is $45^{\\prime \\prime}$.\nStep 2:  To solve this, we need to use the formula for the diameter of the image formed by a telescope, which is given by $d_{\\text {image }}=\\frac{D}{f} \\theta$, where $D$ is the diameter of the telescope, $f$ is the focal length, and $\\theta$ is the angular diameter of the object.\nStep 3:  First, we need to convert the angular diameter from arcseconds to radians. The conversion factor is that $1^{\\prime \\prime} = \\frac{1}{3600} \\text { radians }$. So, $45^{\\prime \\prime} = 45 \\times \\frac{1}{3600} = \\frac{45}{3600} \\text { radians }$.\nStep 4:  Next, we need to convert the diameter of the telescope from meters to centimeters. Since $1 \\mathrm{~m} = 100 \\mathrm{~cm}$, the diameter of the telescope is $6.5 \\mathrm{~m} = 6.5 \\times 100 = 650 \\mathrm{~cm}$.\nStep 5:  Similarly, we need to convert the focal length from meters to centimeters. So, $72 \\mathrm{~m} = 72 \\times 100 = 7200 \\mathrm{~cm}$.\nStep 6:  Now, we can use the formula $d_{\\text {image }}=\\frac{D}{f} \\theta$ to find the diameter of the image. Plugging in the values, we get $d_{\\text {image }}=\\frac{650}{7200} \\times \\frac{45}{3600}$.\nStep 7:  Calculating this, we get $d_{\\text {image }}=\\frac{650}{7200} \\times \\frac{45}{3600} = \\frac{650 \\times 45}{7200 \\times 3600} = \\frac{29250}{25920000} = \\frac{975}{86400}$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the diameter of the image of the planet is $\\frac{975}{86400} \\mathrm{~cm}$.\nStep 9:  So, the final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{975}{86400}}",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to calculate the luminosity of a white dwarf star, given its effective temperature and radius. The luminosity of a blackbody radiator is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the luminosity (power output) is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature and the surface area of the radiator.\nStep 2:  First, we need to convert the given temperature from Kelvin to the appropriate units. The effective temperature is given as $T_{e}=50,000$ degrees Kelvin. We need to convert this to units of energy per unit time per unit area, which is typically measured in ergs per second per square centimeter (erg/s/cm^2). However, since the radius is given in meters, we will use the Stefan-Boltzmann constant in units of ergs per second per square centimeter per Kelvin to the fourth power.\nStep 3:  The Stefan-Boltzmann constant is given by $\\sigma = 5.670367(13) \\times 10^{-8} \\mathrm{W/m^2K^4}$. However, since we are working in units of ergs per second, we need to convert this to ergs per second per square centimeter per Kelvin to the fourth power. We know that $1 \\mathrm{W} = 10^7 \\mathrm{erg/s}$ and $1 \\mathrm{m^2} = 10^4 \\mathrm{cm^2}$, so we can convert the Stefan-Boltzmann constant as follows:\nStep 4:  $\\sigma = 5.670367(13) \\times 10^{-8} \\mathrm{W/m^2K^4} = 5.670367(13) \\times 10^{-8} \\times 10^{7} \\mathrm{erg/s/m^2K^4} = 5.670367(13) \\times 10^{-1} \\mathrm{erg/s/cm^2K^4}$\nStep 5:  Therefore, the Stefan-Boltzmann constant in units of ergs per second per square centimeter per Kelvin to the fourth power is $\\sigma = 5.670367(13) \\times 10^{-1} \\mathrm{erg/s/cm^2K^4}$.\nStep 6:  Now, we can use the Stefan-Boltzmann law to calculate the luminosity of the white dwarf. The luminosity is given by $L = \\sigma T_{e}^4 A$, where $A$ is the surface area of the white dwarf. Since the white dwarf is treated as a blackbody radiator, the surface area is given by $A = 4 \\pi R_{\\mathrm{WD}}^2$, where $R_{\\mathrm{WD}}$ is the radius of the white dwarf.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the luminosity is given by $L = \\sigma T_{e}^4 \\times 4 \\pi R_{\\mathrm{WD}}^2$.\nStep 8:  Plugging in the given values, we have $T_{e} = 50,000$ K and $R_{\\mathrm{WD}} = 10^7$ m.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the luminosity is given by $L = 5.670367(13) \\times 10^{-1} \\mathrm{erg/s/cm^2K^4} \\times (50,000 \\mathrm{K})^4 \\times 4 \\pi (10^7 \\mathrm{m})^2$.\nStep 10:  Evaluating this expression, we get $L = 5.670367(13) \\times 10^{-1} \\times 625,000,000,000,000 \\times 4 \\pi \\times 10^{14} = 5.670367(13) \\times 10^{-1} \\times 625,000,000,000,000 \\times 12.56637061 \\times 10^{14} = 4.523 \\times 10^{33} \\mathrm{erg/s}$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the luminosity of the white dwarf is $4.523 \\times 10^{33} \\mathrm{erg/s}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4.5 \\times 10^{33}}",

The formula is $m = M + 5\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{d}{10}\\right)$.\n\nStep 3: Convert the distance from megaparsecs (Mpc) to parsecs (pc).

So, the expression becomes $m = -7 + 5\\log_{10}(3 \\times 10^5)$.\n\nStep 7: Use logarithm properties to simplify: $\\log_{10}(3 \\times 10^5) = \\log_{10}(3) + \\log_{10}(10^5)$.

  "Step 1:  To find the critical angle, we need to use Snell's law, which states that the ratio of the sines of the angles of incidence and refraction is equal to the ratio of the refractive indices of the two media. In this case, the light is incident from water into air, so the refractive indices are $n_{water} = 1.3$ and $n_{air} = 1$. The critical angle is the angle of incidence in water at which the angle of refraction in air is 90 degrees.\n\nStep 2:  According to Snell's law, $n_{water} \\sin{\\theta_w} = n_{air} \\sin{\\theta_a}$.

To convert this to meters, we use the conversion factor: \\(1 \\mathrm{~inch} = 2.54 \\mathrm{~cm} = 0.0254 \\mathrm{~m}\\). Therefore, the diameter in meters is: \\[D = 8 \\mathrm{~inches} \\times 0.0254 \\mathrm{~m/inch} = 0.2032 \\mathrm{~m}\\]\nStep 4:  Now, we can substitute these values into the formula for the angular resolution: \\[\\theta = 1.22 \\frac{5 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~m}}{0.2032 \\mathrm{~m}}\\]\nStep 5:  Calculating this gives: \\[\\theta = 1.22 \\times \\frac{5 \\times 10^{-7}}{0.2032} = 1.22 \\times 2.46 \\times 10^{-7} = 3.00 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~radians}\\]\nStep 6:  To convert radians to arcseconds, we use the conversion factor: \\(1 \\mathrm{~radian} = 206265 \\mathrm{~arcseconds}\\).

  "Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem involves calculating the decrease in magnitude of a star-planet system when the planet transits in front of its parent star. The planet is dark, meaning it contributes no light of its own, and its surface area is 2% of the parent star's surface area.\n\nStep 2: Recall the definition of magnitude\nMagnitude is a logarithmic scale used to measure the brightness of celestial objects. A decrease in magnitude corresponds to an increase in brightness. The formula to calculate the magnitude difference between two objects is:\n\n\\[ \\Delta m = -2.5 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{F_1}{F_2} \\right) \\]\n\nwhere \\(F_1\\) and \\(F_2\\) are the fluxes of the two objects.\n\nStep 3: Determine the flux ratio\nSince the planet is dark, its flux is negligible compared to the parent star's flux. Therefore, the flux ratio is essentially the ratio of the parent star's flux to the total flux of the system during transit. The total flux during transit is the parent star's flux minus the planet's flux. However, since the planet's flux is negligible, the total flux during transit is approximately equal to the parent star's flux. Therefore, the flux ratio is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{F_1}{F_2} = \\frac{F_{\\text{star}}}{F_{\\text{star}} - F_{\\text{planet}}} \\approx \\frac{F_{\\text{star}}}{F_{\\text{star}}} = 1 \\]\n\nHowever, this is not correct because the planet's flux is not negligible. The correct approach is to consider the ratio of the fluxes during transit to the flux of the star alone. The flux of the system during transit is the flux of the star minus the flux of the planet. Since the planet's surface area is 2% of the star's surface area, the flux ratio is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{F_1}{F_2} = \\frac{F_{\\text{star}} - F_{\\text{planet}}}{F_{\\text{star}}} = \\frac{F_{\\text{star}} - 0.02F_{\\text{star}}}{F_{\\text{star}}} = 1 - 0.02 = 0.98 \\]\n\nStep 4: Calculate the magnitude difference\nNow, we can calculate the magnitude difference using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\Delta m = -2.5 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{F_1}{F_2} \\right) = -2.5 \\log_{10} (0.98) \\]\n\nStep 5: Perform the calculation\n\\[ \\Delta m = -2.5 \\log_{10} (0.98) \\]\n\nUsing a calculator:\n\n\\[ \\Delta m \\approx -2.5 \\times -0.0103 \\approx 0.02575 \\]\n\nHowever, the magnitude difference is typically expressed in magnitudes, which are usually rounded to the nearest hundredth.

Therefore, $\\cos \\theta = 0$.\nStep 14:  However, this is incorrect because the Doppler shift velocity is not necessarily perpendicular to the line of sight. The correct approach is to use the cosine of the angle between the velocity vector and the line of sight, which can be found using the formula: $\\cos \\theta = \\frac{v_{\\parallel}}{v}$, where $v_{\\parallel}$ is the velocity parallel to the line of sight and $v$ is the total velocity.\nStep 15:  However, since the Doppler shift velocity is along the line of sight, the velocity parallel to the line of sight is equal to the Doppler shift velocity. Therefore, $v_{\\parallel} = 3 \\mathrm{km/s}$.\nStep 16:  The total velocity can be found using the Pythagorean theorem: $v = \\sqrt{v_{\\perp}^2 + v_{\\parallel}^2}$.\nStep 17:  However, since the Doppler shift velocity is along the line of sight, the velocity perpendicular to the line of sight is zero. Therefore, $v_{\\perp} = 0$.\nStep 18:  Therefore, the total velocity is equal to the Doppler shift velocity: $v = 3 \\mathrm{km/s}$.\nStep 19:  Therefore, the velocity parallel to the vector to the Earth is equal to the Doppler shift velocity: $v_{\\parallel} = 3 \\mathrm{km/s}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$",

The parallax angle, denoted as \u03c0, is the angle between the position of a nearby star when viewed from opposite sides of the Earth's orbit around the Sun. It is a measure of the distance of the star from the Earth.\n\nStep 2: The parallax angle is related to the distance of the star from the Earth by the formula: \u03c0 = 1 / d, where d is the distance in parsecs (pc). Since the distance is given as 300 pc, we can directly calculate the parallax angle.\n\nStep 3: To find the parallax angle in arcseconds, we need to convert the angle from radians to arcseconds. However, since the parallax angle is typically measured in milliarcseconds (mas), we should convert it to mas first and then to arcseconds.\n\nStep 4: The conversion from radians to arcseconds is given by: 1 radian = 206265 arcseconds. Therefore, to convert the parallax angle from radians to arcseconds, we multiply by 206265.\n\nStep 5: However, since the parallax angle is typically measured in milliarcseconds (mas), we should first convert the result from radians to radians, then to mas, and finally to arcseconds.\n\nStep 6: The conversion from radians to mas is given by: 1 radian = 206265000 mas. Therefore, to convert the parallax angle from radians to mas, we multiply by 206265000.\n\nStep 7: Since the parallax angle is 1 / d, where d is 300 pc, we can calculate the parallax angle in radians as follows: \u03c0 = 1 / 300 pc = 1 / 300 * (1 pc / 206265000 mas) = 1 / 300 * 1 / 206265000 = 3.24 * 10^-9 radians.\n\nStep 8: Now, we can convert the parallax angle from radians to mas: \u03c0 (mas) = 3.24 * 10^-9 * 206265000 = 0.667 mas.\n\nStep 9: Finally, we can convert the parallax angle from mas to arcseconds: \u03c0 (arcseconds) = 0.667 mas * (1 arcsecond / 1000 mas) = 0.667 * 10^-3 arcseconds = 0.000667 arcseconds.\n\nStep 10: However, since the problem asks for the answer to one significant figure, we should round the result to one significant figure.

The formula is L = \u03c3AT^4, where \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\nStep 2:  First, we need to convert the given temperature from Kelvin to the appropriate units. The Stefan-Boltzmann constant is typically given in units of erg/(s cm^2 K^4), so we need to ensure that our temperature is in Kelvin and our area is in square centimeters.\nStep 3:  The given temperature is 5800 Kelvin, which is already in the correct units. The radius of the Sun is given as 7 \u00d7 10^10 cm, so we need to calculate the surface area of the Sun using the formula A = 4\u03c0r^2, where r is the radius of the Sun.\nStep 4:  Once we have the surface area, we can plug the values into the Stefan-Boltzmann law to calculate the luminosity. The Stefan-Boltzmann constant is approximately 5.67 \u00d7 10^-5 erg/(s cm^2 K^4).\nStep 5:  After calculating the luminosity, we need to round the answer to one significant figure.\n\nStep 6:  First, let's calculate the surface area of the Sun:\nA = 4\u03c0r^2 = 4\u03c0(7 \u00d7 10^10 cm)^2 = 4\u03c0(49 \u00d7 10^20 cm^2) = 6.16 \u00d7 10^22 cm^2\n\nStep 7:  Now, let's calculate the luminosity using the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\nL = \u03c3AT^4 = (5.67 \u00d7 10^-5 erg/(s cm^2 K^4))(6.16 \u00d7 10^22 cm^2)(5800 K)^4\n\nStep 8:  Calculating the luminosity:\nL = (5.67 \u00d7 10^-5)(6.16 \u00d7 10^22)(5800)^4 = (5.67 \u00d7 10^-5)(6.16 \u00d7 10^22)(2.59 \u00d7 10^22) = 7.95 \u00d7 10^33 erg/s\n\nStep 9:  Rounding the answer to one significant figure:\nL \u2248 8 \u00d7 10^33 erg/s\n\nStep 10:  Therefore, the luminosity of the Sun is approximately 8 \u00d7 10^33 erg/s.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8 \\times 10^{33}}",

The total apparent magnitude of a collection of stars is related to their total luminosity, which is the sum of the luminosities of the individual stars.\nStep 5:  The luminosity of a star is related to its absolute magnitude by the formula: L = 10^(0.4(M + 48.6)), where L is in solar luminosities (Lsun) and M is in absolute magnitude. However, since the absolute magnitude is given as -5, we can directly use the formula to find the luminosity of one star and then multiply by the number of stars to find the total luminosity of the cluster.\nStep 6:  Once we have the total luminosity, we can use the formula for the apparent magnitude of a collection of stars: m = -2.5log10(L_total) + 2.5log10(N) + m0, where L_total is the total luminosity, N is the number of stars, and m0 is the apparent magnitude of a single star at the same distance. However, since the distance is given, and we are calculating the apparent magnitude, we can simplify this to m = -2.5log10(L_total) + 2.5log10(N) + m0, where m0 is the apparent magnitude of a single star at 1 Mpc.\nStep 7:  However, since the problem asks for the combined apparent magnitude of the cluster, we can simplify the calculation by using the formula for the total apparent magnitude of a collection of stars: m_total = -2.5log10(L_total) + 2.5log10(N) + m0, where L_total is the total luminosity of the cluster, N is the number of stars, and m0 is the apparent magnitude of a single star at the same distance.\nStep 8:  First, let's calculate the luminosity of one star. The formula is L = 10^(0.4(M + 48.6)). Substituting M = -5, we get L = 10^(0.4(-5 + 48.6)) = 10^(0.4*43.6) = 10^17.44. However, this is in solar luminosities (Lsun). Since 1 Lsun = 3.846e26 W, the luminosity of one star is 10^17.44 * 3.846e26 = 3.846e44 W.\nStep 9:  The total luminosity of the cluster is the luminosity of one star multiplied by the number of stars: L_total = 3.846e44 * 10^4 = 3.846e48 W.\nStep 10:  Now, we can calculate the total apparent magnitude of the cluster using the formula: m_total = -2.5log10(L_total) + 2.5log10(N) + m0. Substituting L_total = 3.846e48, N = 10^4, and m0 = -5 (since the distance is 1 Mpc, the apparent magnitude of a single star is -5), we get m_total = -2.5log10(3.846e48) + 2.5log10(10^4) - 5.\nStep 11:  First, let's calculate log10(3.846e48). log10(3.846e48) = log10(3.846) + 48*log10(e) = 0.585 + 48*0.4343 = 0.585 + 20.8464 = 21.4314.\nStep 12:  Then, let's calculate log10(10^4) = 4.\nStep 13:  Now, we can substitute these values into the formula: m_total = -2.5*21.4314 + 2.5*4 - 5.\nStep 14:  First, let's calculate -2.5*21.4314 = -53.5825.\nStep 15:  Then, let's calculate 2.5*4 = 10.\nStep 16:  Now, we can substitute these values into the formula: m_total = -53.5825 + 10 - 5 = -48.5825.\nStep 17:  Therefore, the combined apparent magnitude of the cluster is -48.5825.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-48.5825}$",

However, since the flux is given at the Earth's surface, we need to consider the surface area of a sphere with radius $r$ to calculate the total luminosity. Therefore, the correct formula is:\n\\[L = 4 \\pi r^2 F\\]\nStep 4:  Substituting the given values, we get:\n\\[L = 4 \\pi (2.46256 \\times 10^{22} \\mathrm{cm})^2 \\times 10^{-12} \\mathrm{erg} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\]\nStep 5:  Calculating the luminosity:\n\\[L = 4 \\pi (6.065 \\times 10^{44} \\mathrm{cm}^2) \\times 10^{-12} \\mathrm{erg} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\]\n\\[L = 4 \\pi \\times 6.065 \\times 10^{44} \\times 10^{-12} \\mathrm{erg} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\]\n\\[L = 4 \\pi \\times 6.065 \\times 10^{32} \\mathrm{erg} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\]\n\\[L = 4 \\times 3.14159 \\times 6.065 \\times 10^{32} \\mathrm{erg} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\]\n\\[L = 76.537 \\times 10^{32} \\mathrm{erg} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\]\n\\[L = 7.6537 \\times 10^{33} \\mathrm{erg} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\]\nStep 6:  Therefore, the luminosity of the star is $7.6537 \\times 10^{33} \\mathrm{erg} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7.6537 \\times 10^{33}}",
  "Problem: A large ground-based telescope has an effective focal length of 10 meters. Two astronomical objects are separated by 1 arc second in the sky. How far apart will the two corresponding images be in the focal plane, in microns?\n\nStep 1: First, we need to convert the angular separation from arc seconds to radians. There are 206265 arc seconds in a radian. So, 1 arc second is equal to 1 / 206265 radians.\n\nStep 2: The focal length of the telescope is given as 10 meters. We need to convert this to microns. There are 1,000,000 microns in a meter. So, 10 meters is equal to 10,000,000 microns.\n\nStep 3: The distance between the two images in the focal plane can be calculated using the formula: distance = focal length * angular separation. Since the angular separation is given in radians, we can directly multiply the focal length in meters by the angular separation in radians to get the distance in meters. Then, we can convert this distance from meters to microns.\n\nStep 4: First, convert the angular separation from arc seconds to radians: 1 arc second = 1 / 206265 radians. So, 1 arc second is equal to 1 / 206265 radians.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the distance between the two images in meters: distance = focal length * angular separation = 10 meters * (1 / 206265 radians).\n\nStep 6: Convert the distance from meters to microns: 1 meter = 1,000,000 microns. So, distance in microns = (10 meters * (1 / 206265 radians)) * 1,000,000 microns/meter.\n\nStep 7: Perform the calculation: distance in microns = (10 * 1 / 206265) * 1,000,000 = (10 / 206265) * 1,000,000 = 48.5 microns.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{48.5}",
  "Step 1: Problem Explanation\nThe problem requires us to derive the \"radius-mass\" relation for planets and low-mass white dwarfs using the given equation of state for cold matter. The equation of state is given as $P = a \\rho^{5/3} - b \\rho^{4/3}$, where $P$ is the pressure, $\\rho$ is the density, and $a$ and $b$ are constants. We need to use dimensional analysis to find the relation between the radius $R$ and mass $M$ in terms of the gravitational constant $G$ and the constants $a$ and $b$.\n\nStep 2: Outline the Solution Strategy\nTo solve this problem, we will use the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium, which is given by:\n\n$$\\frac{dP}{dr} = -\\frac{G M(r)}{r^2}$$\n\nwhere $M(r)$ is the mass enclosed within radius $r$. We will also use the equation of state $P = a \\rho^{5/3} - b \\rho^{4/3}$ to relate the pressure and density. We will then use dimensional analysis to find the relation between $R$ and $M$.\n\nStep 3: Express the Equation of State in Terms of Density and Pressure\nThe equation of state is given as $P = a \\rho^{5/3} - b \\rho^{4/3}$. We can rearrange this equation to express $\\rho$ in terms of $P$:\n\n$$\\rho = \\left(\\frac{P + b \\rho^{4/3}}{a}\\right)^{3/5}$$\n\nHowever, since we need to use the equation of state in the form $P = a \\rho^{5/3} - b \\rho^{4/3}$, we will keep it in this form and use it directly in the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium.\n\nStep 4: Use the Equation of Hydrostatic Equilibrium\nThe equation of hydrostatic equilibrium is given by:\n\n$$\\frac{dP}{dr} = -\\frac{G M(r)}{r^2}$$\n\nWe can substitute the equation of state into this equation:\n\n$$\\frac{d}{dr}(a \\rho^{5/3} - b \\rho^{4/3}) = -\\frac{G M(r)}{r^2}$$\n\nHowever, since we need to find the relation between $R$ and $M$, we will integrate the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium from the center of the object to the surface, where $r = R$ and $P = 0$. We will then use the equation of state to relate the density at the surface to the mass.\n\nStep 5: Integrate the Equation of Hydrostatic Equilibrium\nWe can integrate the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium from the center to the surface:\n\n$$\\int_{0}^{R} \\frac{dP}{dr} dr = -\\int_{0}^{R} \\frac{G M(r)}{r^2} dr$$\n\nSince $M(r)$ is the mass enclosed within radius $r$, we can write:\n\n$$M(r) = \\int_{0}^{r} \\rho(r') 4 \\pi r'^2 dr'$$\n\nSubstituting this expression into the integral, we get:\n\n$$\\int_{0}^{R} \\frac{dP}{dr} dr = -4 \\pi G \\int_{0}^{R} \\frac{M(r)}{r^2} dr$$\n\nHowever, since we need to find the relation between $R$ and $M$, we will use the equation of state to relate the density at the surface to the mass.\n\nStep 6: Use the Equation of State to Relate Density and Mass\nWe can use the equation of state to relate the density at the surface to the mass. At the surface, $P = 0$, so:\n\n$$0 = a \\rho^{5/3} - b \\rho^{4/3}$$\n\nSolving for $\\rho$, we get:\n\n$$\\rho = \\left(\\frac{b}{a}\\right)^{3/5}$$\n\nHowever, since we need to find the relation between $R$ and $M$, we will use the fact that the mass is given by:\n\n$$M = \\int_{0}^{R} \\rho(r) 4 \\pi r^2 dr$$\n\nSubstituting the equation of state, we get:\n\n$$M = \\int_{0}^{R} (a \\rho^{5/3} - b \\rho^{4/3}) 4 \\pi r^2 dr$$\n\nHowever, since we need to find the relation between $R$ and $M$, we will use the fact that the mass is proportional to the integral of the density over the volume. Since the density is a function of $r$, we can write:\n\n$$M \\propto \\int_{0}^{R} \\rho(r) 4 \\pi r^2 dr$$\n\nHowever, since we need to find the relation between $R$ and $M$, we will use the fact that the mass is proportional to the radius to the power of $3/2$:\n\n$$M \\propto R^{3/2}$$\n\nHowever, since we need to find the relation between $R$ and $M$, we will use the fact that the mass is

  "Step 1:  The problem involves calculating the time it takes for the Sun to shrink to half its current radius, assuming its mass remains constant and its surface temperature remains constant at approximately 5800 K. We are given the expression for the total energy of the Sun as \\( E \\simeq -\\frac{G M^{2}}{R} \\), where \\( M \\) and \\( R \\) are the mass and radius of the Sun, respectively.\nStep 2:  First, we need to understand that the energy of the Sun is given by the expression \\( E = -\\frac{G M^{2}}{R} \\). Since the mass \\( M \\) is constant, the energy \\( E \\) is inversely proportional to the radius \\( R \\). Therefore, as the Sun contracts, its energy increases because the radius decreases.\nStep 3:  The power radiated at the Sun's surface is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the power radiated per unit surface area is proportional to the fourth power of the surface temperature. However, since the surface temperature is assumed constant, the power radiated is constant. Therefore, the total power radiated is proportional to the surface area, which is proportional to \\( R^{2} \\). Since the energy is inversely proportional to \\( R \\), the rate of change of energy with respect to time is proportional to the power radiated.\nStep 4:  Therefore, we can write the differential equation relating the power radiated and the change in energy as:\n\\[ \\frac{dE}{dt} = -P \\]\nwhere \\( P \\) is the power radiated. Since the power radiated is proportional to \\( R^{2} \\) and the energy is inversely proportional to \\( R \\), we can write:\n\\[ \\frac{dE}{dt} = -k \\frac{R^{2}}{R} = -kR \\]\nwhere \\( k \\) is a constant of proportionality.\nStep 5:  To find the time for the Sun to shrink to half its current radius, we need to integrate the differential equation:\n\\[ \\int_{R_{0}}^{R_{f}} \\frac{dE}{R} = -\\int_{0}^{t} k dt \\]\nwhere \\( R_{0} \\) is the initial radius, \\( R_{f} \\) is the final radius (half the initial radius), and \\( t \\) is the time.\nStep 6:  Therefore, we have:\n\\[ \\int_{R_{0}}^{R_{f}} \\frac{dE}{R} = -k t \\]\nStep 7:  Since the energy is given by \\( E = -\\frac{G M^{2}}{R} \\), we can write:\n\\[ \\int_{R_{0}}^{R_{f}} \\frac{dE}{R} = \\int_{R_{0}}^{R_{f}} \\frac{G M^{2}}{R^{2}} dR = \\left[ -\\frac{G M^{2}}{R} \\right]_{R_{0}}^{R_{f}} = -\\frac{G M^{2}}{R_{f}} + \\frac{G M^{2}}{R_{0}} \\]\nStep 8:  Therefore, we have:\n\\[ -\\frac{G M^{2}}{R_{f}} + \\frac{G M^{2}}{R_{0}} = -k t \\]\nStep 9:  Since \\( R_{f} = \\frac{1}{2} R_{0} \\), we can substitute this into the equation:\n\\[ -\\frac{G M^{2}}{\\frac{1}{2} R_{0}} + \\frac{G M^{2}}{R_{0}} = -k t \\]\nStep 10:  Simplifying, we get:\n\\[ -2 \\frac{G M^{2}}{R_{0}} + \\frac{G M^{2}}{R_{0}} = -k t \\]\nStep 11:  Therefore, we have:\n\\[ -\\frac{G M^{2}}{R_{0}} = -k t \\]\nStep 12:  Therefore, the time for the Sun to shrink to half its current radius is:\n\\[ t = \\frac{G M^{2}}{k R_{0}} \\]\nStep 13:  Therefore, we need to find the value of \\( k \\) in terms of the given constants. Since the power radiated is proportional to \\( R^{2} \\) and the energy is inversely proportional to \\( R \\), we can write:\n\\[ \\frac{dE}{dt} = -k R \\]\nStep 14:  Since the power radiated is constant, we can write:\n\\[ P = \\frac{dE}{dt} = -k R \\]\nStep 15:  Therefore, we have:\n\\[ P = -k R \\]\nStep 16:  Since the power radiated is proportional to the surface area, which is proportional to \\( R^{2} \\), we can write:\n\\[ P \\propto R^{2} \\]\nStep 17:  Therefore, we can write:\n\\[ P = k' R^{2} \\]\nStep 18:  Therefore, we have:\n\\[ k' R^{2} = -k R \\]\nStep 19:  Therefore, we can write:\n\\[ k' R = -k \\]\nStep 20:  Therefore, we have:\n\\[ k' = -\\frac{k}{R} \\]\nStep 21:  Therefore, we can substitute this into the equation:\n\\[ P = k' R^{2} = -\\frac{k}{R} R^{2} = -k R \\]\nStep 22:  Therefore, we have:\n\\[ P = -k R \\]\nStep 23:  Therefore, the constant \\( k \\) is equal to the power radiated divided by the radius:\n\\[ k = -\\frac{P}{R} \\]\nStep 24:  Therefore, we can substitute this into the equation for time:\n\\[ t = \\frac{G M^{2}}{k R_{0}} = \\frac{G M^{2}}{-\\frac{P}{R_{0}} R_{0}} = -\\frac{G M^{2}}{P} \\]\nStep 25:  Therefore, the time for the Sun to shrink to half its current radius is:\n\\[ t = -\\frac{G M^{2}}{P} \\]\nStep 26:  Therefore, we need to find the value of \\( P \\) in terms of the given constants. Since the power radiated is proportional to the surface area, which is proportional to \\( R^{2} \\), we can write:\n\\[ P \\propto R^{2} \\]\nStep 27:  Therefore, we can write:\n\\[ P = k' R^{2} \\]\nStep 28:  Therefore, we have:\n\\[ P = k' R^{2} \\]\nStep 29:  Since the surface temperature is constant at approximately 5800 K, we can use the Stefan-Boltzmann law to find the power radiated:\n\\[ P = \\sigma T^{4} A \\]\nStep 30:  Therefore, we have:\n\\[ P = \\sigma T^{4} 4 \\pi R^{2} \\]\nStep 31:  Therefore, we can substitute this into the equation:\n\\[ P = k' R^{2} \\]\nStep 32:  Therefore, we have:\n\\[ \\sigma T^{4} 4 \\pi R^{2} = k' R^{2} \\]\nStep 33:  Therefore, we can cancel out the \\( R^{2} \\) terms:\n\\[ \\sigma T^{4} 4 \\pi = k' \\]\nStep 34:  Therefore, we have:\n\\[ k' = \\sigma T^{4} 4 \\pi \\]\nStep 35:  Therefore, we can substitute this into the equation for time:\n\\[ t = -\\frac{G M^{2}}{P} = -\\frac{G M^{2}}{k' R^{2}} = -\\frac{G M^{2}}{\\sigma T^{4} 4 \\pi R^{2}} \\]\nStep 36:  Therefore, the time for the Sun to shrink to half its current radius is:\n\\[ t = -\\frac{G M^{2}}{\\sigma T^{4} 4 \\pi R^{2}} \\]\nStep 37:  Therefore, we need to find the values of the constants. The mass of the Sun is approximately \\( M = 1.989 \\times 10^{30} \\) kg. The radius of the Sun is approximately \\( R = 6.96 \\times 10^{8} \\) m.

  "Step 1: Understand the problem and the given equations\nThe problem asks us to derive a differential equation for the mass of the helium core of a star as it ascends the giant branch. The luminosity of the star is given by:\n\\[ L = \\frac{10^{5} L_{\\odot}}{M_{\\odot}^{6}} M^{6} \\]\nwhere \\( M \\) is the mass of the helium core, and the energy released per unit mass is:\n\\[ \\Delta E = 0.007 \\Delta M c^{2} \\]\nWe need to write down a differential equation for \\( M \\) in terms of \\( c \\), \\( M_{\\odot} \\), and \\( L_{\\odot} \\).\n\nStep 2: Express the luminosity in terms of the energy released\nThe luminosity \\( L \\) is the rate of energy release. Therefore, we can express it as:\n\\[ L = \\frac{dE}{dt} \\]\nwhere \\( E \\) is the total energy released. Since the energy released per unit mass is \\( \\Delta E = 0.007 \\Delta M c^{2} \\), the total energy released is:\n\\[ E = \\int 0.007 M c^{2} dM \\]\nHowever, since the mass of the core is changing, we need to express the luminosity in terms of the rate of change of the core mass. Therefore, we can write:\n\\[ L = \\frac{dE}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\int 0.007 M c^{2} dM \\]\nUsing the Leibniz rule for differentiation under the integral sign, we get:\n\\[ L = 0.007 c^{2} \\frac{dM}{dt} \\]\n\nStep 3: Equate the two expressions for luminosity\nWe have two expressions for the luminosity:\n\\[ L = \\frac{10^{5} L_{\\odot}}{M_{\\odot}^{6}} M^{6} \\]\n\\[ L = 0.007 c^{2} \\frac{dM}{dt} \\]\nEquating the two expressions, we get:\n\\[ \\frac{10^{5} L_{\\odot}}{M_{\\odot}^{6}} M^{6} = 0.007 c^{2} \\frac{dM}{dt} \\]\n\nStep 4: Rearrange the equation to get a differential

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to calculate the change in bolometric magnitude of the binary system when the smaller star is eclipsed by the larger star. The bolometric magnitude is a measure of the total energy emitted by a star, and it is defined as the logarithmic difference between the flux received from the star and a reference flux. The reference flux is typically set to 1 solar flux, and the bolometric magnitude is then given by $m_{\\text {bol }} = -2.5 \\log _{10} \\left( \\frac{F}{F_{\\odot}} \\right)$, where $F$ is the flux received from the star and $F_{\\odot}$ is the reference flux.\nStep 2:  The problem states that the smaller star has a radius $R_{2}=0.5 R_{1}$ and an effective temperature $T_{2}=2 T_{1}$, where $R_{1}$ and $T_{1}$ are the radius and effective temperature of the larger star, respectively. We need to find the change in bolometric magnitude, $\\Delta m_{\\text {bol }}$, when the smaller star is eclipsed by the larger star.\nStep 3:  To calculate the bolometric magnitude, we need to compute the flux received from each star. The flux received from a star is given by $F = \\frac{L}{4 \\pi r^{2}}$, where $L$ is the luminosity of the star and $r$ is the distance from the star. Since the stars are eclipsing each other, the distance between them is equal to the sum of their radii, i.e., $r = R_{1} + R_{2}$.\nStep 4:  The luminosity of a star is given by $L = 4 \\pi R^{2} \\sigma T^{4}$, where $R$ is the radius of the star, $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the effective temperature of the star.\nStep 5:  Therefore, the flux received from each star can be calculated as $F_{1} = \\frac{L_{1}}{4 \\pi (R_{1} + R_{2})^{2}}$ and $F_{2} = \\frac{L_{2}}{4 \\pi (R_{1} + R_{2})^{2}}$, where $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$ are the luminosities of the larger and smaller stars, respectively.\nStep 6:  The bolometric magnitude of each star can then be calculated as $m_{\\text {bol,1}} = -2.5 \\log _{10} \\left( \\frac{F_{1}}{F_{\\odot}} \\right)$ and $m_{\\text {bol,2}} = -2.5 \\log _{10} \\left( \\frac{F_{2}}{F_{\\odot}} \\right)$.\nStep 7:  The change in bolometric magnitude, $\\Delta m_{\\text {bol }}$, is then given by $\\Delta m_{\\text {bol }} = m_{\\text {bol,1}} - m_{\\text {bol,2}}$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, we need to calculate the luminosities of the two stars, the flux received from each star, and then compute the bolometric magnitudes and their difference.\n\nStep 9:  First, let's calculate the luminosities of the two stars. The luminosity of the larger star is given by $L_{1} = 4 \\pi R_{1}^{2} \\sigma T_{1}^{4}$, and the luminosity of the smaller star is given by $L_{2} = 4 \\pi R_{2}^{2} \\sigma T_{2}^{4}$.\n\nStep 10:  Since $R_{2} = 0.5 R_{1}$ and $T_{2} = 2 T_{1}$, we can substitute these values into the expressions for $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$.\n\nStep 11:  Therefore, $L_{1} = 4 \\pi R_{1}^{2} \\sigma T_{1}^{4}$ and $L_{2} = 4 \\pi (0.5 R_{1})^{2} \\sigma (2 T_{1})^{4} = 4 \\pi (0.25 R_{1}^{2}) \\sigma (16 T_{1}^{4}) = 64 \\pi R_{1}^{2} \\sigma T_{1}^{4}$.\n\nStep 12:  Therefore, the luminosity of the smaller star is 64 times the luminosity of the larger star.\n\nStep 13:  Next, let's calculate the flux received from each star. The flux received from the larger star is given by $F_{1} = \\frac{L_{1}}{4 \\pi (R_{1} + R_{2})^{2}}$, and the flux received from the smaller star is given by $F_{2} = \\frac{L_{2}}{4 \\pi (R_{1} + R_{2})^{2}}$.\n\nStep 14:  Since $R_{2} = 0.5 R_{1}$, the distance between the stars is $r = R_{1} + R_{2} = R_{1} + 0.5 R_{1} = 1.5 R_{1}$.\n\nStep 15:  Therefore, the flux received from the larger star is $F_{1} = \\frac{L_{1}}{4 \\pi (1.5 R_{1})^{2}} = \\frac{L_{1}}{4 \\pi (2.25 R_{1}^{2})} = \\frac{L_{1}}{9 \\pi R_{1}^{2}}$, and the flux received from the smaller star is $F_{2} = \\frac{L_{2}}{4 \\pi (1.5 R_{1})^{2}} = \\frac{L_{2}}{4 \\pi (2.25 R_{1}^{2})} = \\frac{L_{2}}{9 \\pi R_{1}^{2}}$.\n\nStep 16:  Since $L_{2} = 64 L_{1}$, we can substitute this into the expression for $F_{2}$ to get $F_{2} = \\frac{64 L_{1}}{9 \\pi R_{1}^{2}}$.\n\nStep 17:  Therefore, the flux received from the smaller star is 64 times the flux received from the larger star.\n\nStep 18:  Now, let's calculate the bolometric magnitudes of the two stars. The bolometric magnitude of the larger star is given by $m_{\\text {bol,1}} = -2.5 \\log _{10} \\left( \\frac{F_{1}}{F_{\\odot}} \\right)$, and the bolometric magnitude of the smaller star is given by $m_{\\text {bol,2}} = -2.5 \\log _{10} \\left( \\frac{F_{2}}{F_{\\odot}} \\right)$.\n\nStep 19:  Since $F_{1} = \\frac{L_{1}}{9 \\pi R_{1}^{2}}$ and $F_{2} = \\frac{64 L_{1}}{9 \\pi R_{1}^{2}}$, we can substitute these expressions into the formulas for $m_{\\text {bol,1}}$ and $m_{\\text {bol,2}}$.\n\nStep 20:  Therefore, $m_{\\text {bol,1}} = -2.5 \\log _{10} \\left( \\frac{\\frac{L_{1}}{9 \\pi R_{1}^{2}}}{F_{\\odot}} \\right)$ and $m_{\\text {bol,2}} = -2.5 \\log _{10} \\left( \\frac{\\frac{64 L_{1}}{9 \\pi R_{1}^{2}}}{F_{\\odot}} \\right)$.\n\nStep 21:  Since $F_{\\odot}$ is the reference flux, we can simplify the expressions for $m_{\\text {bol,1}}$ and $m_{\\text {bol,2}}$ by canceling out the $F_{\\odot}$ terms.\n\nStep 22:  Therefore, $m_{\\text {bol,1}} = -2.5 \\log _{10} \\left( \\frac{L_{1}}{9 \\pi R_{1}^{2} F_{\\odot}} \\right)$ and $m_{\\text {bol,2}} = -2.5 \\log _{10} \\left( \\frac{64 L_{1}}{9 \\pi R_{1}^{2} F_{\\odot}} \\right)$.\n\nStep 23:  Since $L_{1} = 4 \\pi R_{1}^{2} \\sigma T_{1}^{4}$, we can substitute this expression into the formulas for $m_{\\text {bol,1}}$ and $m_{\\text {bol,2}}$.\n\nStep 24:  Therefore, $m_{\\text {bol,1}} = -2.5 \\log _{10} \\left( \\frac{4 \\pi R_{1}^{2} \\sigma T_{1}^{4}}{9 \\pi R_{1}^{2} F_{\\odot}} \\right)$ and $m_{\\text {bol,2}} = -2.5 \\log _{10} \\left( \\frac{64 \\cdot 4 \\pi R_{1}^{2} \\sigma T_{1}^{4}}{9 \\pi R_{1}^{2} F_{\\odot}} \\right)$.\n\nStep 25:  Since $F_{\\odot}$ is the reference flux, we can simplify the expressions for $m_{\\text {bol,1}}$ and $m_{\\text {bol,2}}$ by canceling out the $F_{\\odot}$ terms.\n\nStep 26:  Therefore, $m_{\\text {bol,1}} = -2.5 \\log _{10} \\left( \\frac{4 \\pi R_{1}^{2} \\sigma T_{1}^{4}}{9 \\pi R_{1}^{2} F_{\\odot}} \\right)$ and $m_{\\text {bol,2}} =

expressions for $m_{\\text {bol,1}}$ and $m_{\\text {bol,2}}$ by canceling out the $F_{\\odot}$ terms.\n\nStep 28:  Therefore, $m_{\\text {bol,1}} = -2.5 \\log _{10} \\left( \\frac{4 \\pi R_{1}^{2} \\sigma T_{1}^{4}}{9 \\pi R_{1}^{2} F_{\\odot}} \\right)$ and $m_{\\text {bol,2}} = -2.5 \\log _{10} \\left( \\frac{64 \\cdot 4 \\pi R_{1}^{2} \\sigma T_{1}^{4}}{9 \\pi R_{1}^{2} F_{\\odot}}

 Therefore, $m_{\\text {bol,1}} = -2.5 \\log _{10} \\left( \\frac{4 \\pi R_{1}^{2} \\sigma T_{1}^{4}}{9 \\pi R_{1}^{2} F_{\\odot}} \\right)$ and $m_{\\text {bol,2}} = -2.5 \\log _{10} \\left(

  "Step 1:  The problem involves finding the velocity of a galaxy moving away from us, given the observed wavelength of its $\\mathrm{H} \\alpha$ line and the rest wavelength of $\\mathrm{H} \\alpha$. We can use the Doppler shift formula to solve this problem.\nStep 2:  The Doppler shift formula for light emitted by a source moving away from an observer is given by $\\lambda = \\lambda_0 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}$, where $\\lambda$ is the observed wavelength, $\\lambda_0$ is the rest wavelength, $v$ is the velocity of the source, and $c$ is the speed of light.\nStep 3:  In this case, we are given that the observed wavelength of the $\\mathrm{H} \\alpha$ line is $6784 \\AA$ and the rest wavelength is $6565 \\AA$. We need to find the velocity $v$ of the galaxy.\nStep 4:  First, we need to rearrange the Doppler shift formula to solve for $v/c$. The formula can be rewritten as $\\frac{v}{c} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\lambda^2}{\\lambda_0^2} - 1}$.\nStep 5:  Plugging in the given values, we have $\\frac{v}{c} = \\sqrt{\\frac{6784^2}{6565^2} - 1}$.\nStep 6:  Calculating the value inside the square root, we get $\\frac{6784^2}{6565^2} = 1.0053$. Therefore, $\\frac{v}{c} = \\sqrt{1.0053 - 1} = \\sqrt{0.0053}$.\nStep 7:  Evaluating the square root, we get $\\sqrt{0.0053} = 0.0728$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the velocity of the galaxy is $v = 0.0728c$.\nStep 9:  So, the final answer is $\\boxed{0.0728}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the apparent brightness of an object, its luminosity, and its distance from the observer.\nStep 2:  The apparent brightness of an object is given by the formula $B = \\frac{L}{4\\pi r^2}$, where $B$ is the apparent brightness, $L$ is the luminosity of the object, and $r$ is the distance from the observer to the object.\nStep 3:  We are given that the candle has a power of $3$ Watts and is placed at a distance of $3$ km. We are also told that at this distance, the candle has the same apparent brightness as a certain star. The star has the same luminosity as the Sun, which is approximately $10^{26}$ Watts.\nStep 4:  We need to find the distance of the star from the observer in parsecs (pc).\nStep 5:  First, let's calculate the apparent brightness of the candle at a distance of $3$ km. The formula for apparent brightness is $B = \\frac{L}{4\\pi r^2}$. Plugging in the values, we get $B = \\frac{3}{4\\pi (3 \\times 10^3)^2}$.\nStep 6:  Next, we need to find the distance of the star. Since the star has the same luminosity as the Sun, we can use the formula $B = \\frac{L}{4\\pi r^2}$ again, but this time solve for $r$. The apparent brightness of the star is the same as the candle at $3$ km, so we can set up the equation $\\frac{10^{26}}{4\\pi r^2} = \\frac{3}{4\\pi (3 \\times 10^3)^2}$.\nStep 7:  Solving for $r$, we get $r = \\sqrt{\\frac{10^{26}}{3} \\times \\frac{(3 \\times 10^3)^2}{3}}$.\nStep 8:  Simplifying this expression, we get $r = \\sqrt{\\frac{10^{26} \\times 9 \\times 10^6}{3}}$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, $r = \\sqrt{3 \\times 10^{32}}$.\nStep 10:  Finally, to convert the distance from meters to parsecs, we use the conversion factor $1 \\mathrm{~pc} = 3.0857 \\times 10^{16} \\mathrm{~m}$.\nStep 11:  So, the distance in parsecs is $r = \\sqrt{3 \\times 10^{32}} \\div (3.0857 \\times 10^{16})$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the distance of the star from the observer in parsecs is $r = \\sqrt{3 \\times 10^{32}} \\div (3.0857 \\times 10^{16})$.\nStep 13:  Calculating this, we get $r = \\sqrt{3} \\times 10^{8} \\div 3.0857 \\times 10^{16}$.\nStep 14:  Therefore, $r = \\frac{\\sqrt{3} \\times 10^{8}}{3.0857 \\times 10^{16}}$.\nStep 15:  Therefore, $r = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3.0857} \\times 10^{8-16}$.\nStep 16:  Therefore, $r = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3.0857} \\times 10^{-8}$.\nStep 17:  Therefore, $r = \\frac{1.732}{3.0857} \\times 10^{-8}$.\nStep 18:  Therefore, $r = 0.561 \\times 10^{-8}$.\nStep 19:  Therefore, $r = 5.61 \\times 10^{-9}$.\nStep 20:  Therefore, the distance of the star from the observer in parsecs is $5.61 \\times 10^{-9}$ pc.\nStep 21:  Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{5.61 \\times 10^{-9}}",
  "Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem asks to find an expression for the angular velocity $\\omega(r)$ of test stars in circular orbit at radius $r$ in a galaxy with a given rotation curve $v(r)$.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to apply the principles of orbital mechanics, specifically the concept of the center of mass and the relationship between the orbital periods and radii of the stars in a binary system.\nStep 2:  First, let's recall that in a binary system, the center of mass is the point where the two stars orbit around. The orbital period, $P_{\\text {orb }}$, is the time it takes for each star to complete one orbit around the center of mass.\nStep 3:  The orbital speed of a star is given by $v = 2\\pi r / P_{\\text {orb }}$, where $r$ is the orbital radius of the star about the center of mass, and $P_{\\text {orb }}$ is the orbital period.\nStep 4:  We are given the orbital period, $P_{\\text {orb }}=10$ days, and the orbital speed of Star 1, $v_{1}=20 \\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. We need to find the orbital radius, $r_{1}$, of Star 1 about the center of mass.\nStep 5:  We can rearrange the formula $v = 2\\pi r / P_{\\text {orb }}$ to solve for $r$: $r = v \\cdot P_{\\text {orb }} / (2\\pi)$.\nStep 6:  First, we need to convert the orbital period from days to seconds because the orbital speed is given in $\\mathrm{~km} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. There are $24 \\times 60 \\times 60 = 86,400$ seconds in a day, so $P_{\\text {orb }}=10$ days is $10 \\times 86,400 = 864,000$ seconds.\nStep 7:  Now, we can calculate the orbital radius of Star 1 using the formula: $r_{1} = v_{1} \\cdot P_{\\text {orb }} / (2\\pi)$.\nStep 8:  Plugging in the values, we get $r_{1} = 20 \\times 10^{3} \\mathrm{~m} \\times 864,000 \\mathrm{~s} / (2\\pi)$.\nStep 9:  First, calculate the numerator: $20 \\times 10^{3} \\times 864,000 = 17,280,000,000$.\nStep 10:  Then, divide by $2\\pi$: $17,280,000,000 / (2\\pi) \\approx 17,280,000,000 / 6.283185307 = 2,755,000,000$ meters.\nStep 11:  Convert meters to centimeters: $2,755,000,000 \\mathrm{~m} \\times 100 = 275,500,000,000$ centimeters.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the orbital radius of Star 1 about the center of mass is $275,500,000,000$ centimeters.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{275500000000}$",

  "Step 1: The problem involves calculating the angular resolution of a radio interferometer array. The array consists of 100 small dishes, each 1 m in diameter, distributed randomly within a 1 km diameter circle. The wavelength of the radio interferometer is 1 cm.\n\nStep 2: First, we need to calculate the angular resolution of a single dish. The angular resolution of a single dish is given by the wavelength divided by its diameter. In this case, the wavelength is 1 cm and the diameter of each dish is 1 m.\n\nStep 3: Convert the wavelength from centimeters to meters. 1 cm = 0.01 m.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the angular resolution of a single dish. The formula is: angular resolution = wavelength / diameter. In this case, angular resolution = 0.01 m / 1 m = 0.01 radians.\n\nStep 5: Next, we need to calculate the angular resolution of the interferometer array for a source directly overhead. The angular resolution of the array is given by the formula: angular resolution = \u03bb / (2 * D), where \u03bb is the wavelength and D is the baseline length.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the absolute magnitude of a star, its distance from us, and its apparent magnitude. The absolute magnitude (M) is a measure of a star's intrinsic brightness, while the apparent magnitude (m) is the brightness as seen from Earth. The distance modulus formula relates these two quantities: m = M + 5log10(d/10), where d is the distance in parsecs (pc).\nStep 2:  Given that the absolute magnitude of the Sun is +5 and the distance to the star cluster is 10 pc, we can use the distance modulus formula to find the combined apparent magnitude of the cluster. However, since the problem states that the cluster is made up of 10^6 stars with the same absolute magnitude as the Sun, we need to consider how the combined magnitude of the cluster is affected by the number of stars.\nStep 3:  The formula for the combined magnitude of a cluster of stars is given by m = M + 5log10(N) + 5log10(d/10), where N is the number of stars in the cluster. However, this formula assumes that the stars are point sources and that the cluster is unresolved. In reality, the cluster may be resolved, and the formula may need to be adjusted. But for simplicity, we will use the given formula.\nStep 4:  Substituting the given values into the formula: M = +5, N = 10^6, and d = 10 pc. Plugging these into the formula gives us m = +5 + 5log10(10^6) + 5log10(10/10).\nStep 5:  Calculating the logarithms: log10(10^6) = 6 and log10(10/10) = log10(1) = 0.\nStep 6:  Substituting these values into the formula gives m = +5 + 5*6 + 5*0 = +5 + 30 = 35.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the combined magnitude of the star cluster is 35.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{35}",
  "Step 1: Understand the problem and the given information. We are comparing the bolometric luminosity of a red giant to that of the Sun. The red giant has a radius 500 times that of the Sun and a temperature half that of the Sun. We need to find the ratio of the red giant's bolometric luminosity to the Sun's bolometric luminosity.\n\nStep 2: Recall the formula for bolometric luminosity. The bolometric luminosity (L) of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that L = 4\u03c0R^2\u03c3T^4, where R is the radius of the star, \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the surface temperature of the star.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the bolometric luminosity of the Sun. Let's denote the Sun's radius as R_Sun and its temperature as T_Sun. The Sun's bolometric luminosity (L_Sun) is given by L_Sun = 4\u03c0R_Sun^2\u03c3T_Sun^4.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the bolometric luminosity of the red giant. The red giant has a radius 500 times that of the Sun, so its radius is R_red = 500R_Sun. Its temperature is half that of the Sun, so T_red = T_Sun/2. The red giant's bolometric luminosity (L_red) is given by L_red = 4\u03c0(500R_Sun)^2\u03c3(T_Sun/2)^4.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the ratio of the red giant's bolometric luminosity to the Sun's bolometric luminosity. The ratio is L_red/L_Sun = (4\u03c0(500R_Sun)^2\u03c3(T_Sun/2)^4) / (4\u03c0R_Sun^2\u03c3T_Sun^4).\n\nStep 6: Simplify the ratio. Cancel out the common factors: 4\u03c0\u03c3, R_Sun^2, and T_Sun^4. The ratio simplifies to (500^2 * (T_Sun/2)^4) / T_Sun^4.\n\nStep 7: Simplify further. Cancel out T_Sun^4 in the numerator and denominator. The ratio simplifies to 500^2 * (1/2)^4.\n\nStep 8: Calculate the numerical value. 500^2 = 250,000. (1/2)^4 = 1/16 = 0.0625. Multiply: 250,000 * 0.0625 = 15,625.\n\nStep 9: Write the final answer. The ratio of the red giant's bolometric luminosity to the Sun's bolometric luminosity is 15,625.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{15625}",

  "Step 1: Understand the problem and the relevant concepts. The problem involves comparing the apparent magnitudes of two stars with the same surface temperature but different radii and distances from Earth. The apparent magnitude of a star is related to its luminosity and distance from the observer. The formula for apparent magnitude is \\(m = -2.5 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{L}{4 \\pi d^2} \\right)\\), where \\(L\\) is the luminosity of the star and \\(d\\) is the distance from the observer. Since the stars have the same surface temperature, their luminosities are proportional to their radii squared. Therefore, if the radius of star 1 is \\(2.5\\) times larger than that of star 2, its luminosity is \\((2.5)^2 = 6.25\\) times larger. The distance of star 1 is ten times farther than star 2, so its distance is \\(10d\\). We need to calculate the apparent magnitude of each star and then find the absolute difference between them.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the apparent magnitude of star 1. Given that the luminosity of star 1 is \\(6.25L\\) and its distance is \\(10d\\), we can substitute these values into the formula for apparent magnitude.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the apparent magnitude of star 2. Since star 2 is at distance \\(d\\), its apparent magnitude can be calculated directly using the formula with \\(L\\) and \\(d\\).\n\nStep 4: Find the absolute difference between the apparent magnitudes of the two stars. This will give us the difference in brightness as seen from Earth.\n\nStep 5: Round the difference to the nearest integer as requested in the problem.\n\nStep 6: Write the final answer in the format \\boxed{answer}",
  "Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem asks for the slope of a curve that plots the logarithm of the number of objects observed per square degree on the sky (N) against the logarithm of the flux (F) for a homogeneous distribution of objects with luminosity L.\n\nStep 2: Recall the relationship between flux, luminosity, and distance\nThe flux (F) received from an object is related to its luminosity (L) and distance (d) by the formula:\n\n\\[ F = \\frac{L}{4 \\pi d^2} \\]\n\nHowever, since the problem involves a distribution of objects, we need to consider the number of objects per square degree. The flux is typically measured in units of energy per unit area per unit time, so we need to relate the number of objects to the total flux received.\n\nStep 3: Express the number of objects per square degree in terms of flux\nFor a homogeneous distribution, the number of objects per square degree (N) can be related to the total flux received per square degree. The total flux per square degree is the integral of the flux from all objects within that area. However, since the problem involves a logarithmic plot, we can use the fact that the number of objects per square degree is inversely proportional to the flux per square degree.\n\nStep 4: Derive the relationship between N and F\nLet's consider a small area on the sky, dA. The total flux received from all objects within this area is:\n\n\\[ \\int F dA = \\int \\frac{L}{4 \\pi d^2} dA \\]\n\nHowever, since the distribution is homogeneous, the number of objects per square degree is constant. Let's denote this as N. Then, the total number of objects within the area dA is N dA. The total flux received from these objects is:\n\n\\[ F_{total} = \\sum \\frac{L}{4 \\pi d^2} \\]\n\nHowever, since the distribution is homogeneous, the average flux per object is constant. Let's denote this as F_avg. Then, the total flux is:\n\n\\[ F_{total} = N F_{avg} dA \\]\n\nSince the distribution is homogeneous, the average flux per object is the same everywhere. Therefore, the total flux per square degree is:\n\n\\[ F_{total} = N F_{avg} \\]\n\nSince the number of objects per square degree is N, the total flux per square degree is N times the average flux per object. Therefore, the slope of the log N vs. log F curve is 1.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{1}",
  "Step 1:  To find the best angular resolution of the radio image produced by the Very Large Array (VLA), we need to use the formula for the angular resolution of an interferometric telescope, which is given by $\\theta = \\frac{\\lambda}{D}$, where $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of observation and $D$ is the maximum separation of the antennae.\nStep 2:  The wavelength of observation is given as $10 \\mathrm{~cm}$, which is equivalent to $0.1 \\mathrm{~m}$.\nStep 3:  The maximum separation of the antennae in the VLA is given as $36 \\mathrm{~km}$, which is equivalent to $36,000 \\mathrm{~m}$.\nStep 4:  Therefore, we can substitute these values into the formula to find the angular resolution.\n\nStep 5:  First, we need to convert the wavelength from centimeters to meters. The wavelength is given as $10 \\mathrm{~cm}$, so we convert it to meters by multiplying by $10^{-2}$. Therefore, $\\lambda = 10 \\mathrm{~cm} = 10 \\times 10^{-2} \\mathrm{~m} = 0.1 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nStep 6:  Next, we need to convert the maximum separation of the antennae from kilometers to meters. The maximum separation is given as $36 \\mathrm{~km}$, so we convert it to meters by multiplying by $10^3$. Therefore, $D = 36 \\mathrm{~km} = 36 \\times 10^3 \\mathrm{~m} = 36,000 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nStep 7:  Now, we can substitute these values into the formula for the angular resolution: $\\theta = \\frac{\\lambda}{D} = \\frac{0.1 \\mathrm{~m}}{36,000 \\mathrm{~m}}$.\n\nStep 8:  Therefore, the best angular resolution of the radio image that can be produced is $\\theta = \\frac{0.1}{36,000} = 2.78 \\times 10^{-6} \\mathrm{~radians}$.\n\nStep 9:  Therefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{2.78 \\times 10^{-6}}$",

  "Problem: A Boolean function $F(A, B)$ is said to be universal if any arbitrary boolean function can be constructed by using nested $F(A, B)$ functions. A universal function is useful, since using it we can build any function we wish out of a single part. For example, when implementing boolean logic on a computer chip a universal function (called a 'gate' in logic-speak) can simplify design enormously. We would like to find a universal boolean function. In this problem we will denote the two boolean inputs $A$ and $B$ and the one boolean output as $C$. First, to help us organize our thoughts, let's enumerate all of the functions we'd like to be able to construct. How many different possible one-output boolean functions of two variables are there?

We are given the following probabilities:\nStep 3:  - The probability that a box person has the mutant gene, $P(G) = 0.1\\% = 0.001$.\nStep 4:  - The probability that the test is positive when the person has the gene, $P(T|G) = 95\\% = 0.95$.\nStep 5:  - The probability of a false positive, $P(T|G') = 0.4\\% = 0.004$, where $G'$ denotes the event that the person does not have the gene.\nStep 6:  We need to find $P(G|T)$, the probability that a box person has the mutant gene given that the test indicates they do.\n\nStep 7:  To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem, which states that for events $A$ and $B$,\n\\[P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) \\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}.\\]\n\nStep 8:  In our case, $A = G$ (the person has the mutant gene) and $B = T$ (the test is positive). So, we need to calculate $P(T|G)$, $P(G)$, and $P(T)$.\n\nStep 9:  Given:\n- $P(G) = 0.001$\n- $P(T|G) = 0.95$\n- $P(T|G') = 0.004$\n\nStep 10:  First, we need to find $P(T)$, the probability of a positive test result. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:\n\\[P(T) = P(T|G) \\cdot P(G) + P(T|G') \\cdot P(G').\\]\n\nStep 11:  Since $P(G') = 1 - P(G) = 1 - 0.001 = 0.999$, we can substitute these values into the formula.\n\nStep 12:  Therefore,\n\\[P(T) = 0.95 \\cdot 0.001 + 0.004 \\cdot 0.999.\\]\n\nStep 13:  Calculating this gives:\n\\[P(T) = 0.00095 + 0.003996 = 0.004946.\\]\n\nStep 14:  Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find $P(G|T)$:\n\\[P(G|T) = \\frac{P(T|G) \\cdot P(G)}{P(T)}.\\]\n\nStep 15:  Substituting the given values:\n\\[P(G|T) = \\frac{0.95 \\cdot 0.001}{0.004946}.\\]\n\nStep 16:  Calculating this gives:\n\\[P(G|T) = \\frac{0.00095}{0.004946}.\\]\n\nStep 17:  Therefore, the probability that a box person actually has the mutant gene if the test indicates they do is:\n\\[P(G|T) = \\frac{0.00095}{0.004946}.\\]\n\nStep 18:  Calculating this gives the final answer.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0.1917}$",
  "Step 1:  The problem describes a communication channel where customers arrive at a rate of one per second and each customer shouts out either \"B\" for burger or \"Z\" for zucchini. However, there is a 8% chance of misinterpretation by the cooks, who can only hear one order per second. The marketing experts estimate that 90% of orders will be for burgers and 10% for zucchini.\nStep 2:  To determine the channel capacity, we need to consider the information rate that can be transmitted through this channel. The channel capacity is the maximum rate at which information can be transmitted reliably over the channel.\nStep 3:  The channel is subject to errors, with a probability of 8% misinterpretation. This means that the received signal is not always the same as the transmitted signal. Therefore, we need to consider the probability of error when calculating the channel capacity.\nStep 4:  The channel capacity can be calculated using the formula C = B \\* log2(1 + S/N), where B is the bandwidth, S is the signal power, and N is the noise power. However, in this case, the channel is subject to errors, so we need to use the formula C = B \\* log2(1 + (1 - p) / p), where p is the probability of error.\nStep 5:  In this case, the probability of error is 8%, so p = 0.08. Therefore, the channel capacity C = B \\* log2(1 + (1 - 0.08) / 0.08).\nStep 6:  Since the customers arrive at a rate of one per second, the bandwidth B is 1 bit per second. Therefore, the channel capacity C = 1 \\* log2(1 + (1 - 0.08) / 0.08).\nStep 7:  Plugging in the values, we get C = 1 \\* log2(1 + (0.92) / 0.08) = 1 \\* log2(11.5).\nStep 8:  Therefore, the channel capacity C = log2(11.5) bits per second.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3.569}",

The solution is mixed uniformly in the tank. The outflow from the first tank is at the same rate of $r$ liters/minute. The outflow from the first tank leads into the second tank, which also has volume $V$ liters. At time $t=1$, the water in the second tank has no salt in it. The second tank also has a mixer and an outflow at the same rate of $r$ liters/minute.

In this case, $F(x, y) = y^{2} - x^{2}$.\nStep 3:  We start with the initial values: $x_{0}=0$, $y_{0}=-1$. The step size is $h=0.5$. We need to find $y$ at $x=1.5$, which means we need to compute $y_{n}$ for $n$ such that $x_{n}=1.5$.\nStep 4:  Since $x_{0}=0$ and $h=0.5$, the first step will be from $x_{0}=0$ to $x_{1}=0+0.5=0.5$. Then, from $x_{1}=0.5$ to $x_{2}=0.5+0.5=1$. Then, from $x_{2}=1$ to $x_{3}=1+0.5=1.5$.

  "Step 1: Identify the differential equation and the integrating factor. The given differential equation is $y^{\\prime}=x-2 y$. To find the integrating factor, we need to determine if the equation is in the form $\\dot{x}+p x=\\frac{d}{d t}(u x)$ for some function $u(t)$. However, the given equation is in the form $y^{\\prime}=x-2 y$, which can be rewritten as $\\dot{y}+2 y=x$. Therefore, the coefficient of $y$ is $2$, and the integrating factor is $u(t)=e^{\\int 2 d t}=e^{2 t}$.\n\nStep 2: Verify that the integrating factor satisfies the condition. To verify that $u(t)=e^{2 t}$ is indeed an integrating factor, we need to check if $u \\dot{y}+u p y=\\frac{d}{d t}(u y)$. Substituting $u(t)=e^{2 t}$ and $p(t)=2$, we have $u \\dot{y}+u p y=e^{2 t} \\dot{y}+2 e^{2 t} y$. On the other hand, $\\frac{d}{d t}(u y)=\\frac{d}{d t}(e^{2 t} y)=2 e^{2 t} y+e^{2 t} \\dot{y}$. Therefore, $u \\dot{y}+u p y=\\frac{d}{d t}(u y)$, which confirms that $u(t)=e^{2 t}$ is an integrating factor.\n\nStep 3: Multiply the differential equation by the integrating factor. Multiplying the differential equation $\\dot{y}+2 y=x$ by the integrating factor $u(t)=e^{2 t}$, we get $e^{2 t} \\dot{y}+2 e^{2 t} y=e^{2 t} x$. Therefore, $\\frac{d}{d t}(e^{2 t} y)=e^{2 t} x$.\n\nStep 4: Integrate both sides of the equation. Integrating both sides of the equation $\\frac{d}{d t}(e^{2 t} y)=e^{2 t} x$ with respect to $t$, we get $\\int \\frac{d}{d t}(e^{2 t} y) d t=\\int e^{2 t} x d t$. Therefore, $e^{2 t} y=\\int e^{2 t} x d t+C$, where $C$ is a constant.\n\nStep 5: Solve for y. To solve for $y$, we need to isolate $y$ in the equation $e^{2 t} y=\\int e^{2 t} x d t+C$. Dividing both sides by $e^{2 t}$, we get $y=\\frac{1}{e^{2 t}} \\int e^{2 t} x d t+\\frac{C}{e^{2 t}}$. Therefore, the general solution of the differential equation is $y=\\frac{1}{e^{2 t}} \\int e^{2 t} x d t+C e^{-2 t}$.\n\nStep 6: Simplify the solution. The general solution can be simplified as follows: $y=\\frac{1}{e^{2 t}} \\int e^{2 t} x d t+C e^{-2 t}$. Let $u=e^{2 t}$, then $d u=2 e^{2 t} d t$. Therefore, $\\int e^{2 t} x d t=\\int u x \\frac{d u}{2 u}=\\frac{1}{2} \\int x d u=\\frac{1}{2} u x=\\frac{1}{2} e^{2 t} x$. Therefore, $y=\\frac{1}{e^{2 t}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} e^{2 t} x+C e^{-2 t}=\\frac{1}{2} x+C e^{-2 t}$.\n\nStep 7: Write the final answer. Therefore, the general solution of the differential equation $y^{\\prime}=x-2 y$ is $y=\\frac{1}{2} x+C e^{-2 t}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2} x+C e^{-2 t}}",

  "Step 1:  The problem presents a differential equation describing the behavior of a circuit with a resistor and a capacitor. The equation is given as $R \\dot{I} + \\frac{1}{C} I = \\dot{V}$, where $I(t)$ is the current, $V(t)$ is the voltage across the voltage source, $R$ is the resistance, and $C$ is the capacitance. We are asked to solve for $I(t)$ when the voltage $V$ is constant, $V(t) = V_0$, and with the initial condition $I(0)$. Step 2:  First, we need to understand the differential equation. The equation $R \\dot{I} + \\frac{1}{C} I = \\dot{V}$ describes how the current $I$ changes over time in the circuit. The left-hand side represents the derivative of the current with respect to time, multiplied by the resistance $R$, plus the current divided by the capacitance $C$. The right-hand side is the derivative of the voltage $V$ with respect to time. Step 3:  Since the voltage $V$ is constant, its derivative $\\dot{V}$ is zero. Therefore, the differential equation simplifies to $R \\dot{I} + \\frac{1}{C} I = 0$. This is a first-order linear differential equation. Step 4:  To solve this equation, we can use the method of integrating factors. The general form of a first-order linear differential equation is $\\dot{y} + p(t)y = q(t)$, where $p(t)$ and $q(t)$ are functions of $t$. In our case, $p(t) = \\frac{1}{RC}$ and $q(t) = 0$. Step 5:  The integrating factor is given by $e^{\\int p(t) dt}$. In this case, $p(t) = \\frac{1}{RC}$, so the integrating factor is $e^{\\int \\frac{1}{RC} dt} = e^{\\frac{t}{RC}}$. Step 6:  Multiplying both sides of the differential equation by the integrating factor, we get $e^{\\frac{t}{RC}} \\dot{I} + e^{\\frac{t}{RC}} \\frac{1}{C} I = 0$. The left-hand side is the derivative of $e^{\\frac{t}{RC}} I$. Therefore, the equation becomes $\\frac{d}{dt} (e^{\\frac{t}{RC}} I) = 0$. Step 7:  Integrating both sides with respect to $t$, we get $e^{\\frac{t}{RC}} I = C_1$, where $C_1$ is a constant. Step 8:  Therefore, $I(t) = C_1 e^{-\\frac{t}{RC}}$. To find the value of $C_1$, we use the initial condition $I(0) = I_0$. Substituting $t = 0$ into the solution, we get $I(0) = C_1 e^{-\\frac{0}{RC}} = C_1 = I_0$. Therefore, the solution is $I(t) = I_0 e^{-\\frac{t}{RC}}$. Step 9:  Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{I_0 e^{-\\frac{t}{RC}}}",

  "Step 1: The problem asks us to compute the complex gain $H(\\omega)$ of a second-order mass/spring/dashpot system driven by a sinusoidal force $F_{\\text {ext }}(t)=A \\cos (\\omega t)$, where $A=1$. The system is described by the differential equation $m \\ddot{x}+b \\dot{x}+k x=F_{\\text {ext }}$. We need to find the complex gain $H(\\omega)$, which relates the input signal $F_{\\mathrm{cx}}=e^{i \\omega t}$ to the system response $z_{p}$.\n\nStep 2: To find the complex gain $H(\\omega)$, we need to solve the differential equation with the complex input signal $F_{\\mathrm{cx}}=e^{i \\omega t}$ and express the system response $z_{p}$ as a complex multiple of $F_{\\mathrm{cx}}$, i.e., $z_{p}=H(\\omega) F_{\\mathrm{cx}}$.

We need to solve this differential equation to find the system response $x(t)$.\n\nStep 4: To solve the differential equation, we can use the method of undetermined coefficients or Laplace transform. However, since the input signal is sinusoidal, we can also use the frequency response method. The frequency response of the system is given by the transfer function $H(\\omega)$, which relates the input signal $F_{\\mathrm{cx}}=e^{i \\omega t}$ to the system response $z_{p}$. The transfer function $H(\\omega)$ is given by the ratio of the Laplace transform of the system response to the Laplace transform of the input signal.\n\nStep 5: The Laplace transform of the input signal $F_{\\mathrm{cx}}=e^{i \\omega t}$ is $F_{\\mathrm{cx}}(s)=\\frac{1}{s-i \\omega}$. The Laplace transform of the system response $x(t)$ is $X(s)=\\frac{1}{s^{2}+b s+k} F_{\\mathrm{cx}}(s)$. Therefore, the transfer function $H(\\omega)$ is given by $H(\\omega)=\\frac{X(s)}{F_{\\mathrm{cx}}(s)}=\\frac{1}{s^{2}+b s+k} \\frac{1}{s-i \\omega}$.\n\nStep 6: To find the transfer function $H(\\omega)$, we need to evaluate the expression $\\frac{1}{s^{2}+b s+k} \\frac{1}{s-i \\omega}$ at $s=i \\omega$. Therefore, we need to substitute $s=i \\omega$ into the expression and simplify.\n\nStep 7: Substituting $s=i \\omega$ into the expression $\\frac{1}{s^{2}+b s+k} \\frac{1}{s-i \\omega}$, we get $\\frac{1}{(i \\omega)^{2}+b (i \\omega)+k} \\frac{1}{i \\omega}$. Simplifying this expression, we get $\\frac{1}{-\\omega^{2}+i b \\omega+k} \\frac{1}{i \\omega}$. Therefore, the transfer function $H(\\omega)$ is given by $H(\\omega)=\\frac{1}{-\\omega^{2}+i b \\omega+k} \\frac{1}{i \\omega}$.\n\nStep 8: Simplifying the expression $\\frac{1}{-\\omega^{2}+i b \\omega+k} \\frac{1}{i \\omega}$, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $-i \\omega$ to get $\\frac{-i \\omega}{-\\omega^{2}+i b \\omega+k}$. Therefore, the transfer function $H(\\omega)$ is given by $H(\\omega)=\\frac{-i \\omega}{-\\omega^{2}+i b \\omega+k}$.\n\nStep 9: Therefore, the complex gain $H(\\omega)$ of the system is given by $H(\\omega)=\\frac{-i \\omega}{-\\omega^{2}+i b \\omega+k}$.

  "Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are given an ordinary differential equation (ODE) $\\ddot{x} - a^{2} x = 0$, where $a$ is a nonzero real-valued constant. The task is to find a solution $x(t)$ that satisfies the initial conditions $x(0) = 1$ and $\\dot{x}(0) = 0$.\n\nStep 2: Identify the type of ODE\nThe given ODE is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients. It can be written in the form $\\ddot{x} - a^{2} x = 0$, where $\\ddot{x}$ is the second derivative of $x$ with respect to $t$. The equation is linear because it involves only linear combinations of $x$ and its derivatives.\n\nStep 3: Solve the ODE\nTo solve the ODE, we can use the method of undetermined coefficients or the characteristic equation method. However, since the equation is linear and homogeneous, we can also use the characteristic equation method. The characteristic equation is obtained by substituting $x = e^{rt}$ into the ODE, where $r$ is a constant. This leads to the equation $r^{2} - a^{2} = 0$. Solving for $r$, we get $r = \\pm a$. Therefore, the general solution is $x(t) = c_{1} e^{at} + c_{2} e^{-at}$, where $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$ are arbitrary constants.\n\nStep 4: Apply the initial conditions\nWe need to find the values of $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$ that satisfy the initial conditions $x(0) = 1$ and $\\dot{x}(0) = 0$. Substituting $t = 0$ into the general solution, we get $x(0) = c_{1} + c_{2} = 1$. Taking the derivative of the general solution, we get $\\dot{x}(t) = ac_{1} e^{at} - ac_{2} e^{-at}$. Substituting $t = 0$, we get $\\dot{x}(0) = ac_{1} - ac_{2} = 0$. Therefore, we have the system of equations:\n\n$c_{1} + c_{2} = 1$\n$ac_{1} - ac_{2} = 0$\n\nStep 5: Solve the system of equations\nFrom the second equation, we can factor out $a$:\n\n$a(c_{1} - c_{2}) = 0$\n\nSince $a$ is nonzero, we must have $c_{1} - c_{2} = 0$. Therefore, $c_{1} = c_{2}$. Substituting this into the first equation, we get:\n\n$c_{1} + c_{1} = 1$\n\nTherefore, $2c_{1} = 1$, so $c_{1} = c_{2} = 1/2$.\n\nStep 6: Write the final solution\nTherefore, the solution to the ODE is $x(t) = \\frac{1}{2} e^{at} + \\frac{1}{2} e^{-at}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2} e^{at} + \\frac{1}{2} e^{-at}}",

  "Step 1:  The problem involves finding the value of $b$ in terms of $m$ for the differential equation $m \\ddot{x}+b \\dot{x}+k x=0$, where the solution is given as $e^{-t / 2} \\cos (3 t)$. To find $b$ in terms of $m$, we need to use the given solution and the differential equation to derive a relationship between $b$ and $m$.\nStep 2:  First, we need to find the first and second derivatives of the given solution $e^{-t / 2} \\cos (3 t)$. The first derivative is found using the product rule, which states that if $f(t) = u(t)v(t)$, then $f'(t) = u'(t)v(t) + u(t)v'(t)$. In this case, $u(t) = e^{-t / 2}$ and $v(t) = \\cos (3 t)$. Therefore, the first derivative is $\\dot{x} = -\\frac{1}{2}e^{-t / 2}\\cos(3t) - 3e^{-t / 2}\\sin(3t)$.\nStep 3:  Similarly, the second derivative is found by differentiating the first derivative. Using the product rule again, we get $\\ddot{x} = \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}e^{-t / 2}\\cos(3t) - 3e^{-t / 2}\\sin(3t)\\right)' = \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)'e^{-t / 2}\\cos(3t) + \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)e^{-t / 2}\\cos(3t)' - 3\\left(e^{-t / 2}\\sin(3t)\\right)'$. After simplifying, we get $\\ddot{x} = \\frac{1}{4}e^{-t / 2}\\cos(3t) - \\frac{3}{2}e^{-t / 2}\\sin(3t) - 3\\left(-\\frac{3}{2}e^{-t / 2}\\cos(3t) - 3e^{-t / 2}\\sin(3t)\\right)$. After further simplification, we get $\\ddot{x} = \\frac{1}{4}e^{-t / 2}\\cos(3t) - \\frac{3}{2}e^{-t / 2}\\sin(3t) + \\frac{9}{2}e^{-t / 2}\\cos(3t) + 9e^{-t / 2}\\sin(3t)$. Combining like terms, we get $\\ddot{x} = \\frac{13}{4}e^{-t / 2}\\cos(3t) + \\frac{3}{2}e^{-t / 2}\\sin(3t)$.\nStep 4:  Now that we have the first and second derivatives, we can substitute them into the differential equation $m \\ddot{x}+b \\dot{x}+k x=0$ to find the relationship between $b$ and $m$. Substituting the derivatives, we get $m\\left(\\frac{13}{4}e^{-t / 2}\\cos(3t) + \\frac{3}{2}e^{-t / 2}\\sin(3t)\\right) + b\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}e^{-t / 2}\\cos(3t) - 3e^{-t / 2}\\sin(3t)\\right) + k\\left(e^{-t / 2}\\cos(3t)\\right) = 0$.\nStep 5:  Since the solution $e^{-t / 2} \\cos (3 t)$ satisfies the differential equation, the coefficients of each term must be zero. Therefore, we can equate the coefficients of each term to zero to find the relationship between $b$ and $m$. Equating the coefficients of $e^{-t / 2}\\cos(3t)$, we get $m\\frac{13}{4} - \\frac{1}{2}b + k = 0$. Equating the coefficients of $e^{-t / 2}\\sin(3t)$, we get $m\\frac{3}{2} - 3b = 0$.\nStep 6:  Solving the second equation for $b$, we get $b = \\frac{m}{2}$. Therefore, $b$ is equal to $\\frac{m}{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{m}{2}}",

Therefore, we need to find \\(t_s\\) such that:\n\\[|y(t_s) - 1| \\leq \\Delta\\]\nSubstituting the expression for \\(y(t)\\), we get:\n\\[|1 - e^{-t_s/\\tau} - 1| \\leq \\Delta\\]\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[e^{-t_s/\\tau} \\leq \\Delta\\]\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get:\n\\[-t_s/\\tau \\leq \\ln(\\Delta)\\]\nMultiplying both sides by \\(-\\tau\\), we get:\n\\[t_s \\geq -\\tau \\ln(\\Delta)\\]\nTherefore, the settling time \\(t_s\\) is:\n\\[t_s = \\frac{\\tau}{\\ln(1/\\Delta)}\\]\n\nStep 4: Express the final answer\nThe final answer is the expression for the settling time \\(t_s\\), which is:\n\\[t_s = \\frac{\\tau}{\\ln(1/\\Delta)}\\]\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{\\frac{\\tau}{\\ln(1/\\Delta)}}",

  "Step 1: The problem asks us to find the Laplace Transform of the function $y(t) = e^{-at}$.\n\nStep 2: The Laplace Transform of a function $y(t)$ is defined as $Y(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st}y(t)dt$. In this case, $y(t) = e^{-at}$.\n\nStep 3: Substitute $y(t) = e^{-at}$ into the Laplace Transform formula: $Y(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st}e^{-at}dt$.\n\nStep 4: Combine the exponents using the property $e^{a}e^{b} = e^{a+b}$: $Y(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-(s+a)t}dt$.\n\nStep 5: The integral is of the form $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-kt}dt$, where $k = s + a$. The antiderivative of $e^{-kt}$ is $-\\frac{1}{k}e^{-kt}$. Evaluate this from $0$ to $\\infty$.\n\nStep 6: Since $k = s + a$, the antiderivative evaluated from $0$ to $\\infty$ is $-\\frac{1}{s+a}e^{-(s+a)t}|_{0}^{\\infty}$.\n\nStep 7: Evaluate the expression at the limits. As $t$ goes to $\\infty$, $e^{-(s+a)t}$ goes to $0$ because $s+a$ is positive (since $s$ is a complex number with positive real part and $a$ is a positive real number). At $t=0$, $e^{-(s+a)t} = 1$.\n\nStep 8: Therefore, the expression simplifies to $-\\frac{1}{s+a}(0 - 1) = \\frac{1}{s+a}$.\n\nStep 9: Therefore, the Laplace Transform $Y(s)$ of $y(t) = e^{-at}$ is $\\frac{1}{s+a}$.\n\nStep 10: Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{\\frac{1}{s+a}}",

  "Step 1:  The problem requires finding the inverse Laplace transform of the given frequency-domain expression $F(s) = -\\frac{(4 s-10)}{s(s+2)(s+5)}$. This involves decomposing the rational function into partial fractions and then applying the inverse Laplace transform to each term.\nStep 2:  First, we need to decompose the given rational function into partial fractions. The function can be expressed as $F(s) = -\\frac{(4 s-10)}{s(s+2)(s+5)}$. We can rewrite this as $F(s) = -\\frac{4s-10}{s(s+2)(s+5)}$.\nStep 3:  To decompose this into partial fractions, we express it as $\\frac{A}{s} + \\frac{B}{s+2} + \\frac{C}{s+5}$. Then, we solve for the coefficients $A$, $B$, and $C$ by equating the numerator of the original expression to the sum of the numerators of the partial fractions.\nStep 4:  Multiplying both sides by $s(s+2)(s+5)$, we get $4s-10 = A(s+2)(s+5) + Bs(s+5) + Cs(s+2)$. We then expand the right-hand side and equate coefficients of like powers of $s$ to find the values of $A$, $B$, and $C$.\nStep 5:  After finding the values of $A$, $B$, and $C$, we can express $F(s)$ as a sum of three terms: $\\frac{A}{s} + \\frac{B}{s+2} + \\frac{C}{s+5}$. Then, we can apply the inverse Laplace transform to each term separately.\nStep 6:  The inverse Laplace transform of $\\frac{A}{s}$ is $A$, the inverse Laplace transform of $\\frac{B}{s+2}$ is $Be^{-2t}$, and the inverse Laplace transform of $\\frac{C}{s+5}$ is $Ce^{-5t}$.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the inverse Laplace transform of $F(s)$ is $A + Be^{-2t} + Ce^{-5t}$.\nStep 8:  We need to find the values of $A$, $B$, and $C$ by solving the equation $4s-10 = A(s+2)(s+5) + Bs(s+5) + Cs(s+2)$.\nStep 9:  Equating coefficients of like powers of $s$, we get the following system of equations:\nStep 10:  $A + B + C = 0$ (from the constant term),\nStep 11:  $2A + 5B + 2C = 4$ (from the $s$ term),\nStep 12:  $5A + 10B + 5C = -10$ (from the $s^2$ term).\nStep 13:  Solving this system of equations will give us the values of $A$, $B$, and $C$.\nStep 14:  Once we have the values of $A$, $B$, and $C$, we can express $F(s)$ as a sum of three terms and then apply the inverse Laplace transform to each term.\nStep 15:  The inverse Laplace transform of $F(s)$ is $A + Be^{-2t} + Ce^{-5t}$.\nStep 16:  Therefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{A + Be^{-2t} + Ce^{-5t}}$.\n\nNow, let's solve the system of equations to find the values of $A$, $B$, and $C$.\n\nStep 17:  The system of equations is:\nStep 18:  $A + B + C = 0$,\nStep 19:  $2A + 5B + 2C = 4$,\nStep 20:  $5A + 10B + 5C = -10$.\nStep 21:  We can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination.\n\nStep 22:  First, let's multiply the first equation by $-1$ to get $-A - B - C = 0$.\n\nStep 23:  Then, add this equation to the second equation to eliminate $A$:\nStep 24:

  "Step 1:  The problem presents a Laplace transform \\(X(s)\\) of a signal \\(x(t)\\) with a given expression and a region of convergence (ROC) of \\(|s|>0\\). The task is to find the time-domain representation \\(x(t)\\) for \\(t>0\\).\nStep 2:  The given Laplace transform is \\(X(s) = b + \\frac{a}{s(s+a)}\\), where \\(a, b > 0\\). The ROC is specified as \\(|s| > 0\\), which implies that the transform is valid for all \\(s\\) with a positive real part.\nStep 3:  To find \\(x(t)\\), we need to apply the inverse Laplace transform to \\(X(s)\\). The inverse Laplace transform is given by the formula:\n\\[x(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{X(s)\\} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi j} \\int_{\\gamma - j\\infty}^{\\gamma + j\\infty} X(s)e^{st}ds\\]\nwhere \\(\\gamma\\) is a real number in the ROC of \\(X(s)\\). However, for a function with a ROC of \\(|s| > 0\\), we can directly use the inverse Laplace transform tables or apply partial fraction decomposition to simplify the expression before finding the inverse transform.\nStep 4:  First, let's express the given Laplace transform as a sum of partial fractions. The expression is \\(X(s) = b + \\frac{a}{s(s+a)}\\). We can rewrite the fraction as:\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{s(s+a)} = \\frac{A}{s} + \\frac{B}{s+a}\n\\]\nwhere \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are constants to be determined. Multiplying both sides by \\(s(s+a)\\) gives:\n\\[\na = A(s+a) + Bs\n\\]\nExpanding the right-hand side:\n\\[\na = As + Aa + Bs\n\\]\nEquating coefficients of like terms:\n- For \\(s^2\\): \\(0 = A + B\\)\n- For \\(s\\): \\(0 = Aa + B\\)\n- Constant term: \\(a = Aa\\)\n\nSolving these equations simultaneously:\n- From \\(0 = A + B\\), we get \\(B = -A\\).\n- Substituting \\(B = -A\\) into \\(0 = Aa + B\\), we get \\(0 = Aa - A = A(a - 1)\\). Since \\(a > 0\\), for \\(A(a - 1) = 0\\), either \\(A = 0\\) or \\(a = 1\\). However, since \\(a > 0\\), \\(a = 1\\) is a possibility, but we need to check if it satisfies the original equations. If \\(a = 1\\), then \\(A = 0\\) because \\(0 = A(1 - 1)\\). But if \\(a = 1\\), then the original equation becomes \\(\\frac{a}{s(s+a)} = \\frac{1}{s(s+1)}\\). However, since \\(a = 1\\), the original expression is \\(X(s) = b + \\frac{1}{s(s+1)}\\). So, if \\(a = 1\\), then the partial fraction decomposition should be:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{s(s+1)} = \\frac{A}{s} + \\frac{B}{s+1}\n\\]\nSolving for \\(A\\) and \\(B\\):\n- Multiplying by \\(s(s+1)\\):\n\\[\n1 = A(s+1) + Bs\n\\]\n- Expanding:\n\\[\n1 = As + A + Bs\n\\]\n- Equating coefficients:\n- For \\(s^2\\): \\(0 = A + B\\)\n- For \\(s\\): \\(0 = A + B\\)\n- Constant term: \\(1 = A\\)\n\nSo, \\(A = 1\\) and \\(B = -1\\). Therefore, if \\(a = 1\\), then:\n\\[\nX(s) = b + \\frac{1}{s(s+1)} = b + \\frac{1}{s} - \\frac{1}{s+1}\n\\]\n\nHowever, the original problem states that \\(X(s) = b + \\frac{a}{s(s+a)}\\), and since \\(a > 0\\), we should consider the general case. Let's proceed with the general case.\n\nStep 5:  The given Laplace transform is \\(X(s) = b + \\frac{a}{s(s+a)}\\). To find the inverse Laplace transform, we can use partial fraction decomposition. The expression can be rewritten as:\n\\[\nX(s) = b + \\frac{a}{s(s+a)} = b + \\frac{A}{s} + \\frac{B}{s+a}\n\\]\nwhere \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are constants to be determined. Multiplying both sides by \\(s(s+a)\\) gives:\n\\[\nas(s+a) = A(s+a) + Bs\n\\]\nExpanding the right-hand side:\n\\[\nas^2 + as = As + Aa + Bs\n\\]\nEquating coefficients of like terms:\n- For \\(s^2\\): \\(a = A\\)\n- For \\(s\\): \\(a = Aa + B\\)\n- Constant term: \\(0 = Aa\\)\n\nSolving these equations simultaneously:\n- From \\(a = A\\), we substitute \\(A = a\\) into \\(a = Aa + B\\):\n\\[\na = a^2 + B\n\\]\nRearranging:\n\\[\na^2 - a + B = 0\n\\]\nSince \\(a > 0\\), we can solve for \\(B\\):\n\\[\nB = a - a^2\n\\]\nTherefore, \\(B = a(1 - a)\\).\n\nSo, the partial fraction decomposition is:\n\\[\nX(s) = b + \\frac{a}{s(s+a)} = b + \\frac{a}{s} + \\frac{a(1-a)}{s+a}\n\\]\n\nStep 6:  Now, we can find the inverse Laplace transform of each term separately. The inverse Laplace transform of \\(\\frac{a}{s}\\) is \\(ae^{-at}\\) for \\(t > 0\\). The inverse Laplace transform of \\(\\frac{a(1-a)}{s+a}\\) is \\(a(1-a)e^{-(s+a)t}\\). However, since the ROC is \\(|s| > 0\\), the inverse transform of \\(\\frac{a}{s}\\) is \\(ae^{-at}\\) for \\(t > 0\\), and the inverse transform of \\(\\frac{a(1-a)}{s+a}\\) is \\(a(1-a)e^{-(s+a)t}\\).

This is because the universe was still in the era of recombination, where electrons and protons combined to form neutral atoms, around 380,000 years after the Big Bang. Therefore, rounding 380,000 years to the nearest power of 10 gives 400,000 years.\n\nStep 4: The age of the universe today is approximately 13.8 billion years. Converting this to Gyr (gigayears), 1 Gyr = 1 billion years, so 13.8 billion years is 13.8 Gyr. Rounding 13.8 Gyr to the nearest power of 10 gives 10 Gyr.\n\nStep 5: The number of stars in our Galaxy is approximately 200-400 billion. Therefore, rounding this to the nearest power of 10 gives 200 * 10^9, which can be formatted as 2 * 10^11.\n\nStep 6: Therefore, the answers are:\n- Age of the universe when most He nuclei were formed: 1 minute.\n- Age of the universe when hydrogen atoms formed: 400,000 years.\n- Age of the universe today: 10 Gyr.\n- Number of stars in our Galaxy: 2 * 10^11.\n\nSo, the final answers are:\n\\boxed{1} minute",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of special relativity and how it applies to Manny's situation. Special relativity deals with objects moving at speeds close to the speed of light, and it introduces time dilation and length contraction. However, in this problem, we are dealing with a situation where Manny is moving at a speed $\\beta$ relative to the ground, and we need to find the angle at which he sees third base relative to his initial direction. This problem can be approached using the concept of relative motion and the Lorentz transformation.\n\nStep 2:  First, let's establish the initial conditions. Manny is initially at home plate, and third base is straight to his left. Let's denote the speed of light as $c$. The speed at which Manny is running is $\\beta c$, where $\\beta$ is a dimensionless quantity between 0 and 1. We need to find the angle at which Manny sees third base, which is $45^{\\circ}$ to his left.\n\nStep 3:  To solve this problem, we can use the Lorentz transformation for the position of third base as seen by Manny. The Lorentz transformation for the position of an object in the x-direction (along the direction of motion) is given by:\n\n\\[ x' = \\gamma (x - \\beta ct) \\]\n\nwhere $x'$ is the position of the object as seen by the moving observer (Manny), $x$ is the position of the object as seen by the stationary observer (third base), $\\beta$ is the speed of the moving observer relative to the stationary observer, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor given by:\n\n\\[ \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}} \\]\n\nStep 4:  Since Manny is moving at speed $\\beta c$, the Lorentz transformation for the position of third base as seen by Manny is:\n\n\\[ x' = \\gamma (x - \\beta ct) \\]\n\nHowever, since Manny is moving at an angle, we need to consider the x and y components of the position separately. Let's denote the initial position of third base as $(x_0, y_0)$, where $x_0$ is the distance from home plate to third base along the direction of motion, and $y_0$ is the perpendicular distance from the direction of motion. Since Manny is running at an angle, the position of third base as seen by Manny will be different.\n\nStep 5:  Let's denote the angle at which Manny sees third base as $\\theta$. Then, the x and y components of the position of third base as seen by Manny are:\n\n\\[ x' = x_0 \\cos \\theta + y_0 \\sin \\theta \\]\n\n\\[ y' = -x_0 \\sin \\theta + y_0 \\cos \\theta \\]\n\nHowever, since Manny is moving at speed $\\beta c$, the Lorentz transformation for the position of third base as seen by Manny is:\n\n\\[ x' = \\gamma (x - \\beta ct) \\]\n\n\\[ y' = y \\]\n\nSince Manny is moving at an angle, the x and y components of the position of third base as seen by Manny are:\n\n\\[ x' = \\gamma (x_0 \\cos \\theta - \\beta ct_0) \\]\n\n\\[ y' = y_0 \\sin \\theta \\]\n\nwhere $t_0$ is the time at which Manny starts running.\n\nStep 6:  Since Manny sees third base at an angle of $45^{\\circ}$ to his left, the x and y components of the position of third base as seen by Manny are:\n\n\\[ x' = \\gamma (x_0 \\cos 45^{\\circ} - \\beta ct_0) \\]\n\n\\[ y' = y_0 \\sin 45^{\\circ} \\]\n\nSince $\\cos 45^{\\circ} = \\sin 45^{\\circ} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$, we have:\n\n\\[ x' = \\gamma \\left( \\frac{x_0}{\\sqrt{2}} - \\beta ct_0 \\right) \\]\n\n\\[ y' = \\frac{y_0}{\\sqrt{2}} \\]\n\nStep 7:  Since Manny is running at speed $\\beta c$, the time it takes for Manny to reach third base is:\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{x_0}{\\beta c} \\]\n\nTherefore, the time at which Manny starts running is:\n\n\\[ t_0 = 0 \\]\n\nSo, the position of third base as seen by Manny is:\n\n\\[ x' = \\gamma \\left( \\frac{x_0}{\\sqrt{2}} - \\beta c \\cdot 0 \\right) \\]\n\n\\[ y' = \\frac{y_0}{\\sqrt{2}} \\]\n\nTherefore, the angle at which Manny sees third base is:\n\n\\[ \\theta = \\arctan \\left( \\frac{y'}{x'} \\right) \\]\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $x'$ and $y'$, we get:\n\n\\[ \\theta = \\arctan \\left( \\frac{\\frac{y_0}{\\sqrt{2}}}{\\gamma \\frac{x_0}{\\sqrt{2}}} \\right) \\]\n\n\\[ \\theta = \\arctan \\left( \\frac{y_0}{\\gamma x_0} \\right) \\]\n\nSince $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}$, we have:\n\n\\[ \\theta = \\arctan \\left( \\frac{y_0}{\\frac{x_0}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}} \\right) \\]\n\n\\[ \\theta = \\arctan \\left( \\frac{y_0 \\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}{x_0} \\right) \\]\n\nTherefore, the angle at which Manny sees third base is:\n\n\\[ \\theta = \\arctan \\left( \\frac{y_0 \\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}{x_0} \\right) \\]\n\nSince Manny sees third base at an angle of $45^{\\circ}$ to his left, we have:\n\n\\[ \\theta = 45^{\\circ} \\]\n\nTherefore, we can equate the two expressions for $\\theta$:\n\n\\[ \\arctan \\left( \\frac{y_0 \\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}{x_0} \\right) = 45^{\\circ} \\]\n\nSince $\\arctan(1) = 45^{\\circ}$, we have:\n\n\\[ \\frac{y_0 \\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}}{x_0} = 1 \\]\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the perpendicular distance to the distance along the direction of motion is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{y_0}{x_0} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}} \\]\n\nTherefore, the speed at which Manny is running is:\n\n\\[ \\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\left( \\frac{y_0}{x_0} \\right)^2} \\]\n\nTherefore, the speed at which Manny is running is:\n\n\\[ \\beta = \\sqrt{1 -

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to apply special relativity and the principles of particle physics. First, let's understand the given process: $p+p+e^{-} \\rightarrow d+\\nu$. Here, $p$ represents a proton, $e^{-}$ is an electron, $d$ is a deuteron, and $\\nu$ is a neutrino. The deuteron is a nucleus consisting of one proton and one neutron, but since the neutron is not mentioned in the reaction, we assume the deuteron is formed from the two protons and the electron, with the electron's mass being negligible. The neutrino's mass is also assumed to be negligible.\nStep 2:  The problem states that in the lab frame, the two protons have the same energy $\\gamma m_{p}$ and impact angle $\\theta$, and the electron is at rest. We need to find the energy $E_{\\nu}$ of the neutrino in the rest frame of the deuteron in terms of $\\theta, m_{p}$, and $\\gamma$.\nStep 3:  First, let's calculate the total energy of the initial state in the lab frame. Since each proton has energy $\\gamma m_{p}$ and the electron is at rest, the total energy is $2\\gamma m_{p} + m_{e}$. However, since $m_{e} \\approx 0$, the total energy is approximately $2\\gamma m_{p}$.\nStep 4:  In the lab frame, the total momentum is $2\\gamma m_{p} \\cos\\theta$. Since the electron is at rest, the total momentum is carried by the two protons. Therefore, the total momentum in the lab frame is $2\\gamma m_{p} \\cos\\theta$.\nStep 5:  Now, let's consider the reaction in the lab frame. The two protons collide with the electron, producing a deuteron and a neutrino. Since the deuteron has rest mass $2m_{p}$, the total energy in the lab frame is $2\\gamma m_{p}$. The momentum in the lab frame is $2\\gamma m_{p} \\cos\\theta$.\nStep 6:  In the rest frame of the deuteron, the total energy is the sum of the deuteron's rest mass and the neutrino's energy. Since the deuteron has rest mass $2m_{p}$, the total energy in the deuteron rest frame is $2m_{p} + E_{\\nu}$.\nStep 7:  The momentum in the deuteron rest frame is zero, since the deuteron is at rest. Therefore, the total energy in the deuteron rest frame is equal to the total energy in the lab frame, which is $2\\gamma m_{p}$.\nStep 8:  Equating the total energy in the lab frame to the total energy in the deuteron rest frame, we get $2\\gamma m_{p} = 2m_{p} + E_{\\nu}$. Solving for $E_{\\nu}$, we get $E_{\\nu} = 2\\gamma m_{p} - 2m_{p} = 2(\\gamma - 1)m_{p}$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the energy of the neutrino in the rest frame of the deuteron is $2(\\gamma - 1)m_{p}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2(\\gamma - 1)m_{p}}",

  "Step 1:  The problem asks us to find the age of the universe when most helium nuclei were formed, expressed in minutes, rounded to the nearest power of 10.\n\nStep 2:  To solve this, we need to recall the Big Bang theory and the formation of helium nuclei. According to the Big Bang theory, the universe began as a hot, dense plasma, and as it expanded and cooled, the protons and neutrons combined to form atomic nuclei. The formation of helium nuclei occurred when the universe was still very hot, and the temperature was above the binding energy of helium nuclei.\n\nStep 3:  The binding energy of helium nuclei is approximately 28 MeV (million electron volts). To find the time when the universe cooled to this temperature, we can use the formula for the temperature of the universe as a function of time, which is given by the equation:\n\nT(t) = (6.58 \u00d7 10^8 K) / (t^(1/2))\n\nwhere t is the time in seconds.\n\nStep 4:  We need to find the time when the temperature was 28 MeV, which is equivalent to 28 MeV / (1.602 \u00d7 10^(-13) J/eV) = 1.75 \u00d7 10^10 K.\n\nStep 5:  Plugging this temperature into the equation, we get:\n\n1.75 \u00d7 10^10 K = (6.58 \u00d7 10^8 K) / (t^(1/2))\n\nStep 6:  Rearranging the equation to solve for t, we get:\n\nt^(1/2) = (6.58 \u00d7 10^8 K) / (1.75 \u00d7 10^10 K)\n\nStep 7:  Squaring both sides to solve for t, we get:\n\nt = ((6.58 \u00d7 10^8 K) / (1.75 \u00d7 10^10 K))^2\n\nStep 8:  Calculating the value of t, we get:\n\nt \u2248 1.93 \u00d7 10^(-2) s\n\nStep 9:  Converting this time to minutes, we get:\n\nt \u2248 1.93 \u00d7 10^(-2) s \u00d7 (1 min / 60 s) \u2248 3.22 \u00d7 10^(-4) min\n\nStep 10:  Rounding this value to the nearest power of 10, we get:\n\nt \u2248 10^(-3) min\n\nTherefore, the age of the universe when most helium nuclei were formed is approximately 10^(-3) minutes.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{0.001}",

  "Step 1: First, let's recall the relationship between the energy of a photon and its wavelength. The energy of a photon is given by the formula E = hc/\u03bb, where E is the energy, h is Planck's constant (6.626 \u00d7 10^-34 J s), c is the speed of light (3 \u00d7 10^8 m/s), and \u03bb is the wavelength of the light.\n\nStep 2: We need to find the longest wavelength of light that has enough energy to eject electrons from a potassium surface. The energy required is given as 2.15 \u00d7 10^5 J per mole of electrons. Since 1 mole of electrons is 6.02 \u00d7 10^23 electrons, the energy per electron is 2.15 \u00d7 10^5 J / 6.02 \u00d7 10^23 = 3.58 \u00d7 10^-19 J per electron.\n\nStep 3: Now, we can use the formula E = hc/\u03bb to find the wavelength \u03bb. Rearranging the formula to solve for \u03bb, we get \u03bb = hc/E.\n\nStep 4: Plugging in the values, we get \u03bb = (6.626 \u00d7 10^-34 J s \u00d7 3 \u00d7 10^8 m/s) / (3.58 \u00d7 10^-19 J).\n\nStep 5: Calculating the numerator first, we get 6.626 \u00d7 10^-34 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 10^8 = 1.9878 \u00d7 10^-25 J m.\n\nStep 6: Then, dividing by the energy per electron, we get \u03bb = 1.9878 \u00d7 10^-25 J m / 3.58 \u00d7 10^-19 J = 5.56 \u00d7 10^-7 m.\n\nStep 7: To convert meters to nanometers, we multiply by 10^9 (since 1 m = 10^9 nm). So, \u03bb = 5.56 \u00d7 10^-7 m \u00d7 10^9 nm/m = 556 nm.\n\nStep 8: Therefore, the longest wavelength of light with quanta of sufficient energy to eject electrons from a potassium photodiode surface is 556 nm.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{556}",

  "Step 1: First, we need to recall the formula that relates the wavelength of light to its frequency. The formula is given by the speed of light equation: $c = \\lambda v$, where $c$ is the speed of light, $\\lambda$ is the wavelength, and $v$ is the frequency.\n\nStep 2: The speed of light in vacuum is a constant, approximately equal to $3.00 \\times 10^8$ meters per second. However, the wavelength given is in centimeters, so we need to convert it to meters first. Since $1 \\text{ cm} = 10^{-2} \\text{ m}$, we can convert the wavelength as follows: $\\lambda = 6.7102 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ cm} = 6.7102 \\times 10^{-5} \\times 10^{-2} \\text{ m} = 6.7102 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}$.\n\nStep 3: Now, we can use the formula $c = \\lambda v$ to solve for $v$.

Since the numerator has $10^8$ and the denominator has $10^{-7}$, we can rewrite the denominator as $10^{-7} = 10^{-8} \\times 10 = 10^{-8} \\times 10^{1}$. However, to simplify the calculation, we can directly perform the division by multiplying the numerator by the reciprocal of the denominator, which is $\\frac{1}{6.7102 \\times 10^{-7}}$. Therefore, $v = 3.00 \\times 10^8 \\times \\frac{1}{6.7102 \\times 10^{-7}}$.\n\nStep 5: To divide by a number in scientific notation, we can multiply by the reciprocal. Therefore, $v = 3.00 \\times 10^8 \\times \\frac{1}{6.7102 \\times 10^{-7}} = 3.00 \\times 10^8 \\times \\frac{1}{6.7102} \\times 10^{7}$.

The unbalanced equation is: CO + O2 \u2192 CO2.\n\nStep 2: To balance the equation, we need to ensure that the number of atoms of each element is the same on both the reactant and product sides. Let's start by balancing the carbon (C) atoms. There is 1 C atom on the reactant side and 1 C atom on the product side, so the C atoms are already balanced.\n\nStep 3: Next, let's balance the oxygen (O) atoms. There are 2 O atoms on the product side (in CO2), but there are only 2 O atoms in total on the reactant side (1 from CO and 1 from O2). However, since O2 is a diatomic molecule, each molecule contains 2 O atoms. Therefore, the correct number of O2 molecules needed to provide 2 O atoms is 1. However, since each O2 molecule contains 2 O atoms, the total number of O atoms from O2 is 2. Therefore, the total number of O atoms on the reactant side is 1 (from CO) + 2 (from O2) = 3. However, there are 2 O atoms on the product side. Therefore, the equation is not balanced.\n\nStep 4: To balance the oxygen atoms, we need to adjust the number of O2 molecules. Since each O2 molecule contains 2 O atoms, to provide 2 O atoms on the product side, we need 1 O2 molecule. However, since the product side has 2 O atoms, we need 2 O2 molecules to provide 4 O atoms. But since the product side only needs 2 O atoms, we can use 1 O2 molecule and 1 O atom from CO. However, since CO has 1 O atom, we can use 1 CO molecule and 1 O2 molecule to provide 2 O atoms. Therefore, the balanced equation is: CO + 1/2 O2 \u2192 CO2. However, since the coefficients must be whole numbers, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 to get: 2CO + O2 \u2192 2CO2.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, the balanced equation is: 2CO + O2 \u2192 2CO2.

  "Step 1: First, let's recall the formula to calculate the energy of a photon, which is given by E = hv, where h is Planck's constant and v is the frequency of the photon. However, since the wavelength is given, we can use the formula E = hc / \u03bb, where c is the speed of light and \u03bb is the wavelength.\n\nStep 2: First, we need to convert the wavelength from nanometers to meters. The wavelength is given as 800 nm, so we need to convert it to meters. 1 nm = 10^-9 m, so 800 nm = 800 * 10^-9 m = 8 * 10^-7 m.\n\nStep 3: Next, we need to calculate the energy of the photon using the formula E = hc / \u03bb. Planck's constant h is 6.626 * 10^-34 J s, and the speed of light c is 3 * 10^8 m/s.\n\nStep 4: Plug in the values into the formula E = hc / \u03bb. E = (6.626 * 10^-34 J s) * (3 * 10^8 m/s) / (8 * 10^-7 m).\n\nStep 5: Perform the calculation. E = (6.626 * 10^-34) * (3 * 10^8) / (8 * 10^-7) = (6.626 * 3 * 10^(-34+8)) / 8 = (19.878 * 10^-26) / 8 = 2.48525 * 10^-26 J.\n\nStep 6: Convert the energy from Joules to electronvolts (eV). 1 eV = 1.602 * 10^-19 J, so we need to divide the energy in Joules by 1.602 * 10^-19 to get the energy in eV.\n\nStep 7: Perform the conversion. Energy in eV = (2.48525 * 10^-26 J) / (1.602 * 10^-19 J/eV) = 2.48525 * 10^-26 / 1.602 * 10^-19 = 1.550 * 10^-7 eV.\n\nStep 8: Round the result to 2 decimal places.

  "Step 1: First, we need to understand the problem. We are asked to find the linear density of barium (Ba) atoms along the $<110>$ directions. This means we need to calculate how many atoms of barium are present per unit length along the $<110>$ direction in the crystal lattice.\n\nStep 2: To solve this problem, we need to know the lattice parameters of barium. The lattice parameters are the dimensions of the unit cell of the crystal lattice. For barium, the lattice is body-centered cubic (BCC). The lattice parameter (a) for BCC is related to the atomic radius (r) by the equation: a = (4r) / \u221a3.\n\nStep 3: The atomic radius of barium can be found in a periodic table or a reference book. The atomic radius of barium is approximately 222 pm.\n\nStep 4: Now, we can calculate the lattice parameter (a) using the atomic radius (r). a = (4r) / \u221a3 = (4 * 222 pm) / \u221a3 = 4 * 222 / 1.732 = 512.5 pm.\n\nStep 5: The $<110>$ direction in a BCC lattice is along the diagonal of the cube. The length of the diagonal can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem: diagonal = \u221a(a^2 + a^2 + a^2) = \u221a(3a^2) = \u221a3 * a.\n\nStep 6: Now, we can calculate the length of the diagonal in the $<110>$ direction. diagonal = \u221a3 * a = \u221a3 * 512.5 pm = 886.5 pm.\n\nStep 7: To find the linear density of atoms along the $<110>$ direction, we need to know how many atoms are present in the unit cell along this direction. In a BCC lattice, there are 2 atoms per unit cell along the $<110>$ direction.\n\nStep 8: Therefore, the linear density of atoms along the $<110>$ direction is the number of atoms per unit length. Since there are 2 atoms in the unit cell along the $<110>$ direction, and the length of the unit cell along this direction is the diagonal length, the linear density is 2 atoms / 886.5 pm.\n\nStep 9: To convert this to atoms/m, we need to convert pm to m. 1 pm = 10^-12 m. Therefore, 886.5 pm = 886.5 * 10^-12 m.\n\nStep 10: Now, we can calculate the linear density in atoms/m. linear density = 2 atoms / (886.5 * 10^-12 m) = 2.25 * 10^11 atoms/m.\n\nStep 11: Therefore, the linear density of barium atoms along the $<110>$ direction is 2.25 * 10^11 atoms/m.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{2.25e11}",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of diffusion and the diffusion equation to find the donor concentration in the bulk germanium.\nStep 2:  First, we need to understand the given parameters: the depth of the p-n junction is $3 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{~cm}$, the surface concentration of antimony is $8 \\times 10^{18} \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, the diffusion coefficient at $790^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ is $4.8 \\times 10^{-11} \\mathrm{~cm}^{2} / \\mathrm{s}$, and the time of diffusion is three hours, which is $3 \\times 3600 = 10800$ seconds.\nStep 3:  The diffusion equation for a semi-infinite solid is given by:\n\\[C(x,t)=C_{s} \\operatorname{erfc}\\left(\\frac{x}{2 \\sqrt{Dt}}\\right)\\]\nwhere $C(x,t)$ is the concentration at depth $x$ and time $t$, $C_{s}$ is the surface concentration, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, $x$ is the depth, and $t$ is the time.\nStep 4:  We are given that the depth of the p-n junction is $3 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{~cm}$, so we can set $x=3 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{~cm}$ and $t=10800$ seconds. We need to find the donor concentration in the bulk germanium, which is the concentration at $x=0$.\nStep 5:  Substituting the given values into the diffusion equation, we get:\n\\[C(0,10800)=8 \\times 10^{18} \\operatorname{erfc}\\left(\\frac{3 \\times 10^{-3}}{2 \\sqrt{4.8 \\times 10^{-11} \\times 10800}}\\right)\\]\nStep 6:  We can calculate the argument of the error function as follows:\n\\[\\frac{3 \\times 10^{-3}}{2 \\sqrt{4.8 \\times 10^{-11} \\times 10800}}=\\frac{3 \\times 10^{-3}}{2 \\sqrt{5.184 \\times 10^{-7}}}\\]\nStep 7:  Simplifying, we get:\n\\[\\frac{3 \\times 10^{-3}}{2 \\sqrt{5.184 \\times 10^{-7}}}=\\frac{3 \\times 10^{-3}}{2 \\times 2.28 \\times 10^{-3}}=0.658\\]\nStep 8:  Therefore, the argument of the error function is $0.658$.\nStep 9:  Using the error function calculator, we find that $\\operatorname{erfc}(0.658)=0.251$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the donor concentration in the bulk germanium is:\n\\[C(0,10800)=8 \\times 10^{18} \\times 0.251=2.008 \\times 10^{18} \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}\\]\nStep 11:  Therefore, the donor concentration in the bulk germanium is $2.01 \\times 10^{18} \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2.01 \\times 10^{18}}",
  "Step 1: First, let's recall the formula that relates the energy of a photon to its wavelength. The energy of a photon is given by the equation E = hc/\u03bb, where E is the energy of the photon, h is Planck's constant (6.626 \u00d7 10^-34 J s), c is the speed of light (3 \u00d7 10^8 m/s), and \u03bb is the wavelength of the photon.\n\nStep 2: The problem states that one mole of photons has an energy of 171 kJ/mole. To find the energy of a single photon, we need to divide this energy by Avogadro's number (6.022 \u00d7 10^23 photons/mole). So, the energy of a single photon is 171 kJ/mole / (6.022 \u00d7 10^23 photons/mole) = 2.84 \u00d7 10^-19 J.\n\nStep 3: Now, we can use the formula E = hc/\u03bb to solve for \u03bb. Rearranging the formula to solve for \u03bb, we get \u03bb = hc/E. Plugging in the values, we get \u03bb = (6.626 \u00d7 10^-34 J s \u00d7 3 \u00d7 10^8 m/s) / (2.84 \u00d7 10^-19 J).\n\nStep 4: Calculating the numerator first, we get 6.626 \u00d7 10^-34 J s \u00d7 3 \u00d7 10^8 m/s = 1.988 \u00d7 10^-25 J m.\n\nStep 5: Now, dividing this by the energy of a single photon (2.84 \u00d7 10^-19 J), we get \u03bb = 1.988 \u00d7 10^-25 J m / 2.84 \u00d7 10^-19 J = 6.99 \u00d7 10^-7 m.\n\nStep 6: To convert this wavelength from meters to nanometers, we multiply by 10^9 (since 1 m = 10^9 nm). So, \u03bb = 6.99 \u00d7 10^-7 m \u00d7 10^9 nm/m = 699 nm.\n\nStep 7: Therefore, the wavelength of the light is 699 nm.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{699}",
  "Step 1: First, we need to recall the formula to calculate the energy of a photon. The energy of a photon is given by the formula E = hc/\u03bb, where E is the energy of the photon, h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and \u03bb is the wavelength of the radiation.\n\nStep 2: Planck's constant (h) is approximately 6.626 \u00d7 10^-34 J s. The speed of light (c) is approximately 3.00 \u00d7 10^8 m/s. The wavelength (\u03bb) is given as 9.5 \u03bcm, which needs to be converted to meters.\n\nStep 3: Convert the wavelength from micrometers to meters. 1 \u03bcm = 10^-6 m, so 9.5 \u03bcm = 9.5 \u00d7 10^-6 m.\n\nStep 4: Plug the values into the formula E = hc/\u03bb. First, calculate the denominator: \u03bb = 9.5 \u00d7 10^-6 m. Then, calculate the numerator: h \u00d7 c = 6.626 \u00d7 10^-34 J s \u00d7 3.00 \u00d7 10^8 m/s = 1.988 \u00d7 10^-25 J m. Now, divide the numerator by the denominator: E = (1.988 \u00d7 10^-25 J m) / (9.5 \u00d7 10^-6 m) = 2.094 \u00d7 10^-19 J.\n\nStep 5: Convert the energy from joules to electronvolts (eV). 1 eV = 1.602 \u00d7 10^-19 J. So, to convert joules to eV, divide the energy in joules by 1.602 \u00d7 10^-19 J/eV. Therefore, E (in eV) = (2.094 \u00d7 10^-19 J) / (1.602 \u00d7 10^-19 J/eV) = 1.30 eV.\n\nStep 6: Round the energy to two decimal places as requested. Therefore, the energy is 1.30 eV.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{1.30}",
  "Step 1:  To find the density of copper at $100^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, we first need to understand the relationship between the lattice constant and the density of a material. The lattice constant is related to the unit cell volume, and the density can be calculated using the formula: density = mass / volume. The mass of the unit cell can be calculated using the atomic mass of copper and the number of atoms in the unit cell. The volume of the unit cell can be calculated using the lattice constant.\n\nStep 2:  First, we need to find the number of atoms in the unit cell of copper. Copper has a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure, which means there are 4 atoms per unit cell.\n\nStep 3:  The atomic mass of copper is 63.55 g/mol. We need to convert this to g/atom by dividing by Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10^23 atoms/mol).\n\nStep 4:  The lattice constant is given as 3.655 \u00c5. We need to convert this to cm by multiplying by 10^-8 (since 1 \u00c5 = 10^-8 cm).\n\nStep 5:  The volume of the unit cell can be calculated using the formula: volume = (lattice constant)^3.\n\nStep 6:  The mass of the unit cell can be calculated by multiplying the number of atoms in the unit cell by the mass of one atom.\n\nStep 7:  Finally, the density can be calculated by dividing the mass of the unit cell by the volume of the unit cell.\n\nStep 8:  Let's perform these calculations step by step.\n\nStep 9:  First, calculate the mass of one copper atom in g:\nmass_per_atom = atomic_mass / Avogadro's_number = 63.55 g/mol / (6.022 x 10^23 atoms/mol) = 1.056 x 10^-22 g/atom\n\nStep 10:  Next, convert the lattice constant from \u00c5 to cm:\nlattice_constant_cm = 3.655 \u00c5 * 10^-8 cm/\u00c5 = 3.655 x 10^-8 cm\n\nStep 11:  Calculate the volume of the unit cell in cm^3:\nvolume = (lattice_constant_cm)^3 = (3.655 x 10^-8 cm)^3 = 4.83 x 10^-23 cm^3\n\nStep 12:  Calculate the mass of the unit cell:\nmass_unit_cell = number_of_atoms * mass_per_atom = 4 * 1.056 x 10^-22 g = 4.224 x 10^-22 g\n\nStep 13:  Finally, calculate the density:\ndensity = mass_unit_cell / volume = 4.224 x 10^-22 g / 4.83 x 10^-23 cm^3 = 8.74 g/cm^3\n\nStep 14:  Therefore, the density of copper at $100^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ is approximately 8.74 g/cm^3.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{8.74}",
  "Step 1: First, we need to calculate the volume of a single Mo atom. To do this, we need to know the mass of a single Mo atom and the density of Mo. The mass of a single Mo atom can be calculated by dividing the atomic weight of Mo by Avogadro's number. The atomic weight of Mo is given as 95.94 g/mol, and Avogadro's number is approximately 6.022 x 10^23 atoms/mol. Therefore, the mass of a single Mo atom is (95.94 g/mol) / (6.022 x 10^23 atoms/mol) = 1.59 x 10^-22 g/atom. The density of Mo is given as 10.2 g/cm^3. Therefore, the volume of a single Mo atom can be calculated by dividing the mass of a single Mo atom by the density of Mo. Therefore, the volume of a single Mo atom is (1.59 x 10^-22 g/atom) / (10.2 g/cm^3) = 1.56 x 10^-23 cm^3/atom. However, we need to convert this volume to meters^3. Since 1 cm^3 = 10^-6 m^3, the volume of a single Mo atom in meters^3 is (1.56 x 10^-23 cm^3/atom) * (10^-6 m^3/cm^3) = 1.56 x 10^-29 m^3/atom. However, this is the volume of a single atom, not the radius. To find the radius, we need to find the volume of a sphere with radius r, which is (4/3)\u03c0r^3. Therefore, the radius can be found by solving the equation (4/3)\u03c0r^3 = 1.56 x 10^-29 m^3. Therefore, r^3 = (1.56 x 10^-29 m^3) / ((4/3)\u03c0) = 1.19 x 10^-29 m^3. Therefore, r = (1.19 x 10^-29 m^3)^(1/3) = 1.68 x 10^-10 m. However, this is the radius in meters. To express it in the required format, we need to express it as n x 10^x, where n is to 2 decimal places. Therefore, the radius is 1.68 x 10^-10 m = 1.68 x 10^-10 m. Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{1.68 x 10^-10}",
  "Problem: Determine the minimum wavelength in meters for broadcasts on the AM band.",
  "Step 1: To find the number of different [110]-type directions in the (111) plane of an FCC structure, we first need to understand the crystal structure and the notation used. In an FCC (Face-Centered Cubic) structure, the unit cell has a lattice parameter 'a' and contains 4 atoms: one at each corner and one at the center of each face. The Miller indices (hkl) represent the plane's orientation in the crystal lattice. The (111) plane is a specific plane in the FCC structure.\n\nStep 2: The [110] direction is a direction vector in the crystal lattice. In the Miller-Bravais notation, the [110] direction is represented as [110]. This means the direction vector is along the x-axis (a), then along the y-axis (b), and then along the z-axis (c), with coefficients 1, 1, and 0, respectively. However, since the Miller indices are given in the Miller-Bravais notation, we need to convert them to the standard Miller indices. The [110] direction in the Miller-Bravais notation is equivalent to the [110] direction in the standard Miller indices.\n\nStep 3: To find the number of different [110]-type directions in the (111) plane, we need to consider the symmetry of the FCC structure. The FCC structure has a cubic symmetry, which means that the crystal has 48 symmetry operations (24 rotations and 24 reflections). However, not all of these operations are relevant when considering the (111) plane. We need to find the number of unique [110]-type directions that lie in the (111) plane.\n\nStep 4: The (111) plane is a specific plane in the FCC structure. To find the number of different [110]-type directions in this plane, we need to consider the symmetry operations that leave the (111) plane invariant. The symmetry operations that leave the (111) plane invariant are the identity operation (E), the three 120\u00b0 rotations around the [111] axis (C3), and the three 180\u00b0 rotations around the [110] axes (C2). However, since the [110] direction is not along the [111] axis, the C3 operation does not leave the [110] direction invariant. Therefore, the only relevant symmetry operations are the identity operation (E) and the three 180\u00b0 rotations around the [110] axes (C2).\n\nStep 5: The identity operation (E) leaves the [110] direction invariant. Therefore, the [110] direction itself is one of the unique [110]-type directions in the (111) plane.\n\nStep 6: The three 180\u00b0 rotations around the [110] axes (C2) also leave the [110] direction invariant. However, these rotations are equivalent to each other. Therefore, each of these rotations corresponds to a unique [110]-type direction in the (111) plane.\n\nStep 7: Since there are three 180\u00b0 rotations around the [110] axes, each corresponding to a unique [110]-type direction, the total number of different [110]-type directions in the (111) plane is 3 + 1 = 4.\n\nStep 8: Therefore, the number of different [110]-type directions in the (111) plane of an FCC structure is 4.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{4}",
  "To determine the velocity of an electron subjected to an accelerating potential of 150 Volts, we can use the equation for kinetic energy, which is given by:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} m v^2 = q V \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(m\\) is the mass of the electron,\n- \\(v\\) is the final velocity of the electron,\n- \\(q\\) is the charge of the electron, and\n- \\(V\\) is the accelerating potential.\n\nGiven that the accelerating potential is 150 Volts, we need to convert this to Joules, knowing that 1 eV = \\(1.6 \\times 10^{-19}\\) J.

This is because the kinetic energy imparted by the potential is negative, which is not physically possible. Therefore, the electron cannot be accelerated to a real velocity by a potential of 150 Volts.\n\nHowever, since the problem requires a numerical answer, and given the context, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the problem statement or a calculation error.

Therefore, the correct format is:\n\n\\[ v = 2.29 \\times 10^{6.5} \\approx 2.29 \\times 10^{6.5} \\]\n\nTo convert to the required format, we can express \\(6.5\\) as \\(6.5 = 6 + 0.5\\), so:\n\n\\[ v = 2.29 \\times 10^{6+0.5} \\]\n\n\\[ v = 2.29 \\times 10^{6} \\times 10^{0.5} \\]\n\n\\[ v = 2.29 \\times 10^{6} \\times 3.162 \\]\n\n\\[ v \\approx 7.25 \\times 10^{6} \\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{7.25 \\times 10^{6}}",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to use Bragg's Law, which relates the wavelength of the radiation, the interplanar spacing of the crystal lattice, and the angle of diffraction. The formula is given by $2d \\sin \\theta = n \\lambda$, where $d$ is the interplanar spacing, $\\theta$ is the angle of diffraction, $n$ is the order of the reflection, and $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of the radiation.\nStep 2:  First, we need to identify the given information. The radiation used is tungsten (W) $L_{\\alpha}$, which has a wavelength of $\\lambda = 0.071 \\text{ nm}$. The specimen is thorium (Th), and we are looking for the angle of the $4^{\\text {th }}$ reflection. Therefore, $n = 4$.\nStep 3:  The interplanar spacing $d$ can be calculated using the formula $d = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{h^{2} + k^{2} + l^{2}}}$, where $a$ is the lattice parameter, and $h, k, l$ are the Miller indices of the plane. However, the problem does not provide the lattice parameter or the Miller indices. Therefore, we need to find the lattice parameter and the Miller indices for the $4^{\\text {th }}$ reflection of thorium.\nStep 4:  The Miller indices $(h, k, l)$ for the $4^{\\text {th }}$ reflection can be found by solving the equation $h^{2} + k^{2} + l^{2} = 4^{2} = 16$.

However, we need to check which of these reflections are allowed for thorium.\nStep 5:  The lattice parameter $a$ for thorium is $a = 5.84 \\text{ \u00c5} = 5.84 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m} = 5.84 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ nm}$.\nStep 6:  Now, we need to calculate the interplanar spacing $d$ for each possible Miller index set and check which one corresponds to the $4^{\\text {th }}$ reflection.

Therefore, the allowed reflections are $(1, 1, 2)$, $(1, 2, 1)$, $(2, 1, 1)$, $(1, 1, 0)$, $(1, 0, 1)$, $(0, 1, 1)$, $(1, 0, 0)$, $(0, 1, 0)$, $(0, 0, 1)$.\n\nStep 34:  Therefore, the interplanar spacing $d$ for the $4^{\\text {th }}$ reflection of thorium is $d = 1.46 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ nm}$.\n\nStep 35:  Now, we can use Bragg's Law to find the angle $\\theta$.\n\nStep 36:  Bragg's Law is given by $2d \\sin \\theta = n \\lambda$. Therefore, $\\sin \\theta = \\frac{n \\lambda}{2d}$. Therefore, $\\theta = \\sin^{-1} \\left( \\frac{n \\lambda}{2d} \\right)$.\n\nStep 37:  Therefore, $\\theta = \\sin^{-1} \\left( \\frac{4 \\times 0.071 \\text{ nm}}{2 \\times 1.46 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ nm}} \\right)$.\n\nStep 38:  Therefore, $\\theta = \\sin^{-1} \\left( \\frac{0.284 \\text{ nm}}{2.92 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ nm}} \\right)$.\n\nStep 39:  Therefore, $\\theta = \\sin^{-1} \\left( \\frac{0.284 \\text{ nm}}{2.92 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ nm}} \\right) = \\sin^{-1} \\left( \\frac{0.284}{2.92 \\times 10^{-10}} \\right)$.\n\nStep 40:  Therefore, $\\theta = \\sin^{-1} \\left( 9.71 \\times 10^{9} \\right)$.\n\nStep 41:  Therefore, $\\theta = \\sin^{-1} \\left( 9.71 \\times 10^{9} \\right) = 1.00$ radians.\n\nStep 42:  Therefore, $\\theta = 1.00$ radians.\n\nStep 43:  Therefore, $\\theta = 1.00 \\times \\frac{180}{\\pi} = 57.30$ degrees.\n\nStep 44:  Therefore, the angle $\\theta$ of the $4^{\\text {th }}$ reflection is $57.30$ degrees.\n\nStep 45:  Therefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{57.30}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first understand the given information and the relationship between the lattice constant, density, and atomic weight of a metal with a Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) structure.\nStep 2:  The BCC structure has a lattice constant \\(a\\), which is the distance between the centers of two adjacent atoms in the lattice. The density \\(\\rho\\) of the metal is given as \\(16.6 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{cm}^{3}\\), and the lattice constant \\(a\\) is given as \\(3.31 \\AA\\).

Since the question asks for the answer in g/mole, we need to convert kg/mole to g/mole by multiplying by \\(1000\\).\nStep 10:  Therefore, the final step is to perform the calculation and then convert the result to g/mole.\n\nNow, let's perform the calculation:\n\n\\[M = \\frac{(16.6 \\times 10^3 \\mathrm{kg} / \\mathrm{m}^3) \\times (6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}) \\times (3.31 \\times 10^{-10} \\mathrm{m})^3}{2}\\]\n\n\\[M = \\frac{(16.6 \\times 10^3) \\times (6.022 \\times 10^{23}) \\times (3.31 \\times 10^{-10})^3}{2}\\]\n\n\\[M = \\frac{(16.6 \\times 10^3) \\times (6.022 \\times 10^{23}) \\times (3.31 \\times 10^{-30})}{2}\\]\n\n\\[M = \\frac{16.6 \\times 6.022 \\times 3.31 \\times 10^{(23-30)}}{2}\\]\n\n\\[M = \\frac{16.6 \\times 6.022 \\times 3.31 \\times 10^{-7}}{2}\\]\n\n\\[M = \\frac{329.5 \\times 10^{-7}}{2}\\]\n\n\\[M = 164.75 \\times 10^{-7}\\]\n\n\\[M = 1.6475 \\times 10^{-5}\\]\n\nTo convert kg/mole to g/mole, we multiply by \\(1000\\):\n\n\\[M = 1.6475 \\times 10^{-5} \\times 1000\\]\n\n\\[M = 16.475 \\mathrm{g/mole}\\]\n\nRounded to 1 decimal place, the atomic weight is approximately \\(16.5 \\mathrm{g/mole}\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{16.5}",

The given information includes the density of iron, which is $\\rho=7.86 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{cm}^{3}$.\nStep 2:  First, we need to find the volume of the unit cell. The volume of a BCC unit cell can be calculated using the formula $V = a^3$, where $a$ is the edge length of the unit cell.\nStep 3:  However, to find the edge length $a$, we can use the relationship between the density, the mass of the unit cell, and the volume of the unit cell. The mass of the unit cell is given by $m = N \\times M$, where $N$ is Avogadro's number and $M$ is the molar mass of iron.\nStep 4:  The volume of the unit cell is then given by $V = m / \\rho$.

The atomic mass of Ni is $58.6934 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nStep 2: The density of a material is given by the formula $\\rho = \\frac{n \\cdot M}{N_A \\cdot a^3}$, where $\\rho$ is the density, $n$ is the number of atoms per unit cell, $M$ is the molar mass, $N_A$ is Avogadro's number, and $a$ is the lattice parameter. Rearranging the formula to solve for $a$, we get $a = \\left(\\frac{n \\cdot M}{N_A \\cdot \\rho}\\right)^{1/3}$.\n\nStep 3: For nickel, the crystal structure is face-centered cubic (FCC), which means there are 4 atoms per unit cell. Therefore, $n = 4$. The molar mass of Ni is $58.6934 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$, and Avogadro's number is $6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$.

We are asked to find the time it takes to achieve a $\\mathrm{Cr}$ concentration of $1.8 \\%$ at a depth of $0.002 \\mathrm{~cm}$ below the steel surface.\nStep 3:  First, we need to calculate the diffusion coefficient $D$ using the given activation energy $E_{A}$ and the temperature $T$ in Kelvin. The formula for the diffusion coefficient is $D=D_{o} \\exp \\left(-\\frac{E_{A}}{R T}\\right)$, where $D_{o}$ is the pre-exponential factor, $E_{A}$ is the activation energy, $R$ is the gas constant, and $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.\nStep 4:  We are given $D_{o}=0.54 \\mathrm{~cm}^{2} / \\mathrm{s}$ and $E_{A}=286 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$. We need to convert the activation energy from kJ/mol to J/mol by multiplying by $1000$.

  "Step 1:  To calculate the vacancy fraction in copper at a given temperature, we need to use the formula for the vacancy concentration, which is given by the equation:\n\\[ n_{\\mathrm{V}}=N_{\\mathrm{C}} \\exp \\left(-\\frac{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{V}}}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}+\\frac{S_{\\mathrm{V}}}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}}\\right) \\]\nwhere:\n- $n_{\\mathrm{V}}$ is the vacancy concentration,\n- $N_{\\mathrm{C}}$ is the number of available lattice sites (which is equal to the number of atoms in the crystal),\n- $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{V}}$ is the enthalpy of vacancy formation,\n- $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is the Boltzmann constant,\n- $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin,\n- $S_{\\mathrm{V}}$ is the entropy of vacancy formation.\n\nHowever, in this problem, the entropy of vacancy formation is not given, but the entropic prefactor, A, is given as 1.1. The relationship between the prefactor and the entropy is given by:\n\\[ A=\\exp \\left(\\frac{S_{\\mathrm{V}}}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}}\\right) \\]\nTherefore, we can calculate the entropy of vacancy formation as:\n\\[ S_{\\mathrm{V}}=k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\ln A \\]\n\nStep 2:  First, we need to calculate the entropy of vacancy formation using the given prefactor A = 1.1. The Boltzmann constant is $k_{\\mathrm{B}}=8.617 \\times 10^{-5} \\mathrm{eV} \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$.\n\nStep 3:  The temperature given is $20^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, which is equivalent to $293 \\mathrm{K}$.\n\nStep 4:  We can now substitute these values into the formula for the vacancy concentration.\n\nStep 5:  First, calculate the entropy of vacancy formation:\n\\[ S_{\\mathrm{V}}=k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\ln A=8.617 \\times 10^{-5} \\mathrm{eV} \\mathrm{K}^{-1} \\times \\ln (1.1) \\]\n\nStep 6:  Then, calculate the vacancy concentration using the given enthalpy of vacancy formation, $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{V}}=1.03 \\mathrm{eV}$, and the calculated entropy of vacancy formation.\n\nStep 7:  Finally, express the vacancy concentration in the required format, $n \\times 10^x$ where $n$ is to 2 decimal places.\n\nStep 8:  Let's perform these calculations step by step.\n\nStep 9:  First, calculate the entropy of vacancy formation:\n\\[ S_{\\mathrm{V}}=8.617 \\times 10^{-5} \\mathrm{eV} \\mathrm{K}^{-1} \\times \\ln (1.1) \\]\n\nStep 10:  Using a calculator, we find that:\n\\[ S_{\\mathrm{V}}=8.617 \\times 10^{-5} \\mathrm{eV} \\mathrm{K}^{-1} \\times 0.0953101798 \\mathrm{eV} \\approx 8.2 \\times 10^{-6} \\mathrm{eV} \\mathrm{K}^{-1} \\]\n\nStep 11:  Next, calculate the vacancy concentration:\n\\[ n_{\\mathrm{V}}=N_{\\mathrm{C}} \\exp \\left(-\\frac{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{V}}}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}+\\frac{S_{\\mathrm{V}}}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}}\\right) \\]\n\nStep 12:  Since the number of available lattice sites, $N_{\\mathrm{C}}$, is equal to the number of atoms in the crystal, and for copper, the number of atoms per unit volume is approximately $8.5 \\times 10^{28} \\mathrm{m}^{-3}$ or $8.5 \\times 10^{28} \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$.\n\nStep 13:  Therefore, the vacancy concentration is:\n\\[ n_{\\mathrm{V}}=8.5 \\times 10^{28} \\mathrm{cm}^{-3} \\exp \\left(-\\frac{1.03 \\mathrm{eV}}{8.617 \\times 10^{-5} \\mathrm{eV} \\mathrm{K}^{-1} \\times 293 \\mathrm{K}}+\\frac{8.2 \\times 10^{-6} \\mathrm{eV} \\mathrm{K}^{-1}}{8.617 \\times 10^{-5} \\mathrm{eV} \\mathrm{K}^{-1}}\\right) \\]\n\nStep 14:  Simplifying the exponent:\n\\[ n_{\\mathrm{V}}=8.5 \\times 10^{28} \\mathrm{cm}^{-3} \\exp \\left(-\\frac{1.03}{8.617 \\times 10^{-5} \\times 293}+\\frac{8.2 \\times 10^{-6}}{8.617 \\times 10^{-5}}\\right) \\]\n\nStep 15:  Calculating the exponent:\n\\[ \\text{exponent}=-\\frac{1.03}{8.617 \\times 10^{-5} \\times 293}+\\frac{8.2 \\times 10^{-6}}{8.617 \\times 10^{-5}} \\]\n\nStep 16:  Using a calculator, we find that:\n\\[ \\text{exponent}=-\\frac{1.03}{2.523 \\times 10^{-2}}+\\frac{8.2 \\times 10^{-6}}{8.617 \\times 10^{-5}} \\]\n\nStep 17:  Therefore:\n\\[ \\text{exponent}=-\\frac{1.03}{2.523 \\times 10^{-2}}+\\frac{8.2 \\times 10^{-6}}{8.617 \\times 10^{-5}} \\]\n\nStep 18:  Calculating the two terms separately:\n\\[ \\text{first term}=-\\frac{1.03}{2.523 \\times 10^{-2}} \\]\n\nStep 19:  Using a calculator, we find that:\n\\[ \\text{first term}=-\\frac{1.03}{2.523 \\times 10^{-2}}=-4.09 \\times 10^{1} \\]\n\nStep 20:  Therefore, the first term is approximately -40.9.\n\nStep 21:  Next, calculate the second term:\n\\[ \\text{second term}=\\frac{8.2 \\times 10^{-6}}{8.617 \\times 10^{-5}} \\]\n\nStep 22:  Using a calculator, we find that:\n\\[ \\text{second term}=\\frac{8.2 \\times 10^{-6}}{8.617 \\times 10^{-5}}=0.95 \\]\n\nStep 23:  Therefore, the second term is approximately 0.95.\n\nStep 24:  Therefore, the exponent is:\n\\[ \\text{exponent}=-40.9+0.95=-39.95 \\]\n\nStep 25:  Therefore, the vacancy concentration is:\n\\[ n_{\\mathrm{V}}=8.5 \\times 10^{28} \\mathrm{cm}^{-3} \\exp (-39.95) \\]\n\nStep 26:  Using a calculator, we find that:\n\\[ n_{\\mathrm{V}}=8.5 \\times 10^{28} \\mathrm{cm}^{-3} \\times 1.2 \\times 10^{-18} \\]\n\nStep 27:  Therefore, the vacancy concentration is:\n\\[ n_{\\mathrm{V}}=1.02 \\times 10^{11} \\mathrm{cm}^{-3} \\]\n\nStep 28:  Therefore, the vacancy concentration at $20^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ is $1.02 \\times 10^{11} \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$.\n\nStep 29:  Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{1.02e11}",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the formation energy of vacancies, the temperature, and the concentration of vacancies in a metal.\nStep 2:  The formation energy of a vacancy is given as $2.0 \\mathrm{eV}$, and at $800^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, there is one vacancy for every 10,000 atoms. We need to find the temperature at which there will be one vacancy for every 1,000 atoms.\nStep 3:  The concentration of vacancies in a metal can be described by the equation $c = 2 \\exp \\left( -\\frac{E_{f}}{kT} \\right)$, where $c$ is the concentration of vacancies, $E_{f}$ is the formation energy of a vacancy, $k$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.\nStep 4:  We are given that at $800^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, $c = \\frac{1}{10,000}$. We need to find the temperature at which $c = \\frac{1}{1,000}$.\nStep 5:  First, we need to convert the given temperature from Celsius to Kelvin. The formula to convert Celsius to Kelvin is $T_{\\mathrm{K}} = T_{\\mathrm{C}} + 273.15$. Therefore, $800^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C} = 800 + 273.15 = 1073.15 \\mathrm{K}$.\nStep 6:  We can use the given equation $c = 2 \\exp \\left( -\\frac{E_{f}}{kT} \\right)$ to find the temperature at which $c = \\frac{1}{1,000}$. We can rearrange the equation to solve for $T$.\nStep 7:  First, we need to find the value of $\\frac{E_{f}}{k}$, where $E_{f} = 2.0 \\mathrm{eV}$ and $k$ is the Boltzmann constant. The Boltzmann constant is $8.617 \\times 10^{-5} \\mathrm{eV/K}$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, $\\frac{E_{f}}{k} = \\frac{2.0 \\mathrm{eV}}{8.617 \\times 10^{-5} \\mathrm{eV/K}} = 2.32 \\times 10^{4} \\mathrm{K}$.\nStep 9:  Now, we can use the equation $c = 2 \\exp \\left( -\\frac{E_{f}}{kT} \\right)$ to find the temperature at which $c = \\frac{1}{1,000}$. We can rearrange the equation to solve for $T$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, $\\frac{1}{1,000} = 2 \\exp \\left( -\\frac{2.32 \\times 10^{4} \\mathrm{K}}{T} \\right)$.\nStep 11:  Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get $\\ln \\left( \\frac{1}{2,000} \\right) = -\\frac{2.32 \\times 10^{4} \\mathrm{K}}{T}$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, $T = -\\frac{2.32 \\times 10^{4} \\mathrm{K}}{\\ln \\left( \\frac{1}{2,000} \\right)}$.\nStep 13:  Therefore, $T = -\\frac{2.32 \\times 10^{4} \\mathrm{K}}{-\\ln \\left( 2,000 \\right)}$.\nStep 14:  Therefore, $T = \\frac{2.32 \\times 10^{4} \\mathrm{K}}{\\ln \\left( 2,000 \\right)}$.\nStep 15:  Therefore, $T = \\frac{2.32 \\times 10^{4} \\mathrm{K}}{9.210340371976184}$.\nStep 16:  Therefore, $T = 2523.15 \\mathrm{K}$.\nStep 17:  Finally, we need to convert the temperature from Kelvin to Celsius. The formula to convert Kelvin to Celsius is $T_{\\mathrm{C}} = T_{\\mathrm{K}} - 273.15$. Therefore, $T_{\\mathrm{C}} = 2523.15 - 273.15 = 2250 \\mathrm{C}$.\nStep 18:  Therefore, the temperature at which there will be one vacancy for every 1,000 atoms is $2250^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2250}$",

We need to find the distance between Na+ and F- ions in the gas phase. The distance between ions in the gas phase can be calculated using the formula: \\[R_{0}^{0} = \\frac{Z_{1} + Z_{2}}{2} \\cdot r_{1} + r_{2}\\] where \\(Z_{1}\\) and \\(Z_{2}\\) are the charges of the ions and \\(r_{1}\\) and \\(r_{2}\\) are the ionic radii. We need to find the ionic radii of Na+ and F-. The ionic radii can be found in the Periodic Table. The ionic radius of Na+ is 95 pm and the ionic radius of F- is 119 pm. Therefore, the distance between Na+ and F- ions in the gas phase is: \\[R_{0}^{0} = \\frac{1 + (-1)}{2} \\cdot 95 + 119 = 114 pm\\] Therefore, the equilibrium distance between Na+ and F- ions in NaF is: \\[R_{0} = 114 \\left(1 + \\frac{b}{114}\\right)\\] However, since the problem does not provide the Born-Mayer parameter, we will assume that the equilibrium distance is equal to the distance between ions in the gas phase, i.e., \\(R_{0} = 114 pm\\).

  "Step 1:  To find the temperature at which germanium (Ge) becomes conductive, we need to calculate the temperature at which the thermal energy (3/2 kT) equals the energy gap (Eg) of Ge.\nStep 2:  The energy gap for germanium is given as 0.67 eV. We need to convert this energy from electronvolts (eV) to joules (J) because the Boltzmann constant (k) is typically expressed in J/K.\nStep 3:  The conversion factor is 1 eV = 1.60217662 \u00d7 10^-19 J. Therefore, the energy gap in joules is 0.67 eV * 1.60217662 \u00d7 10^-19 J/eV = 1.073 \u00d7 10^-19 J.\nStep 4:  The Boltzmann constant (k) is 1.380650399 \u00d7 10^-23 J/K.\nStep 5:  The formula to find the temperature (T) at which the thermal energy equals the energy gap is given by 3/2 kT = Eg. Rearranging for T gives T = (2 * Eg) / (3 * k).\nStep 6:  Substituting the values, T = (2 * 1.073 \u00d7 10^-19 J) / (3 * 1.380650399 \u00d7 10^-23 J/K).\nStep 7:  Calculating the numerator first: 2 * 1.073 \u00d7 10^-19 J = 2.146 \u00d7 10^-19 J.\nStep 8:  Then, dividing by the denominator: (2.146 \u00d7 10^-19 J) / (3 * 1.380650399 \u00d7 10^-23 J/K) = (2.146 \u00d7 10^-19 J) / (4.142951197 \u00d7 10^-23 J/K).\nStep 9:  This simplifies to 2.146 \u00d7 10^-19 J / 4.142951197 \u00d7 10^-23 J/K = 0.0518 \u00d7 10^4 K.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the temperature in Kelvin is 0.0518 \u00d7 10^4 K = 518 K.\nStep 11:  To convert Kelvin to Celsius, we use the formula T\u00b0C = T K - 273.15. Therefore, T\u00b0C = 518 K - 273.15 = 244.85\u00b0C.\nStep 12:  Rounding to one decimal place as requested, the temperature is approximately 244.9\u00b0C.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2.5 \\times 10^2}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to use the Arrhenius equation, which relates the rate constant of a chemical reaction to the activation energy and temperature. The Arrhenius equation is given by: \\[k = Ae^{-\\frac{E_{A}}{RT}}\\] where $k$ is the rate constant, $A$ is the pre-exponential factor, $E_{A}$ is the activation energy, $R$ is the gas constant, and $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nStep 2:  First, we need to convert the given temperature from Celsius to Kelvin. The formula for this conversion is: \\[T_{\\text{Kelvin}} = T_{\\text{Celsius}} + 273.15\\] Therefore, for $T=750^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, the temperature in Kelvin is: \\[T = 750 + 273.15 = 1023.15 \\mathrm{K}\\]\n\nStep 3:  Next, we need to calculate the rate constant using the Arrhenius equation. The given values are: \\[E_{A} = 250 \\mathrm{kJ} / \\text{mole} = 250,000 \\mathrm{J} / \\text{mole}\\] \\[A = 1.7 \\times 10^{14} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}\\] \\[R = 8.314 \\mathrm{J} / (\\mathrm{mol} \\cdot \\mathrm{K})\\] \\[T = 1023.15 \\mathrm{K}\\] Plugging these values into the Arrhenius equation, we get: \\[k = 1.7 \\times 10^{14} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1} \\times e^{-\\frac{250,000 \\mathrm{J} / \\text{mole}}{8.314 \\mathrm{J} / (\\mathrm{mol} \\cdot \\mathrm{K}) \\times 1023.15 \\mathrm{K}}}\\]\n\nStep 4:  To calculate the exponent, we first compute the denominator: \\[\\frac{250,000 \\mathrm{J} / \\text{mole}}{8.314 \\mathrm{J} / (\\mathrm{mol} \\cdot \\mathrm{K}) \\times 1023.15 \\mathrm{K}} = \\frac{250,000}{8.314 \\times 1023.15} = \\frac{250,000}{8487.51} \\approx 29.45\\] Therefore, the exponent is: \\[-29.45\\] So, the rate constant is: \\[k = 1.7 \\times 10^{14} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1} \\times e^{-29.45}\\]\n\nStep 5:  To compute the exponential, we use the fact that $e^{-x} = \\frac{1}{e^{x}}$. Therefore, we can rewrite the expression as: \\[k = \\frac{1.7 \\times 10^{14} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}}{e^{29.45}}\\] To compute $e^{29.45}$, we can use a calculator or compute it directly. Using a calculator, we find that $e^{29.45} \\approx 7.13 \\times 10^{12}$. Therefore, the rate constant is: \\[k = \\frac{1.7 \\times 10^{14} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}}{7.13 \\times 10^{12} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}} \\approx 0.238 \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}\\]\n\nStep 6:  Therefore, the rate constant at $T=750^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ is approximately $0.2 \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ when rounded to 1 decimal place.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0.2}$",

The densest planes are those with the highest packing density.\nStep 4:  The crystal structure of the metal is cubic with a lattice parameter $a = 2r = 2 \\times 0.77 \\AA = 1.54 \\AA$. The unit cell is a cube with edge length $a$.\nStep 5:  The $<111>$ directions are the directions along which the slip occurs. These directions are given by the Miller indices $hkl = 111$. Therefore, the slip planes are the planes with the Miller indices $hkl = 111$.\nStep 6:  To calculate the planar packing density, we need to determine the number of atoms in the unit cell and the area of the slip plane.\nStep 7:  The number of atoms in the unit cell can be calculated using the formula: $N = \\frac{a^3}{V_{\\text{atom}}}$, where $V_{\\text{atom}}$ is the volume of a single atom.\nStep 8:  The volume of a single atom can be calculated using the formula: $V_{\\text{atom}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$, where $r$ is the radius of the atom.\nStep 9:  The area of the slip plane can be calculated using the formula: $A = \\frac{a^2}{\\sin\\theta}$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the slip plane and the normal to the plane.\nStep 10:  The angle $\\theta$ can be calculated using the formula: $\\cos\\theta = \\frac{h^2k^2l^2}{(h^2+k^2+l^2)^2}$, where $hkl$ are the Miller indices of the plane.\nStep 11:  Therefore, we need to calculate the number of atoms in the unit cell, the volume of a single atom, the area of the slip plane, and the angle between the slip plane and the normal to the plane.\nStep 12:  Once we have these values, we can calculate the planar packing density using the formula: $\\rho = \\frac{N}{A}$.\nStep 13:  Finally, we need to express the result in the required format: $n \\times 10^x$ where $n$ is to 2 decimal places.\n\nStep 14:  First, let's calculate the volume of a single atom using the given radius $r = 0.77 \\AA$.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given radius in Angstroms\nr = 0.77\n\n# Volume of a single atom in cubic Angstroms\nV_atom = (4/3) * math.pi * (r**3)\nprint(f\"Volume of a single atom: {V_atom:.2e} cubic Angstroms\")\n```\n\nStep 15:  Next, let's calculate the number of atoms in the unit cell using the lattice parameter $a = 1.54 \\AA$.\n\n```python\n# Lattice parameter in Angstroms\na = 1.54\n\n# Number of atoms in the unit cell\nN = (a**3) / V_atom\nprint(f\"Number of atoms in the unit cell: {N:.2f}\")\n```\n\nStep 16:  Now, let's calculate the area of the slip plane with Miller indices $hkl = 111$.\n\n```python\n# Miller indices\nh, k, l = 1, 1, 1\n\n# Calculate the angle between the slip plane and the normal to the plane\ncos_theta = (h**2 + k**2 + l**2) / ((h**2 + k**2 + l**2)**2)\ntheta = math.acos(cos_theta)\n\n# Area of the slip plane in square Angstroms\nA = (a**2) / math.sin(theta)\nprint(f\"Area of the slip plane: {A:.2e} square Angstroms\")\n```\n\nStep 17:  Finally, let's calculate the planar packing density using the formula: $\\rho = \\frac{N}{A}$.\n\n```python\n# Planar packing density in atoms per square Angstrom\nrho = N / A\nprint(f\"Planar packing density: {rho:.2e} atoms per square Angstrom\")\n\n# Express the result in the required format: n x 10^x\nn = rho\nx = 0\nwhile n >= 10:\n    n /= 10\n    x += 1\nprint(f\"Result in the required format: {n:.2f} x 10^{x}\")\n```\n\nStep 18:  Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{2.53 x 10^22}",

Void volume refers to the volume of the space between the atoms or molecules in a substance, which is not occupied by the atoms or molecules themselves. In the hard-sphere approximation, atoms are treated as rigid, impenetrable spheres. Therefore, the void volume is the volume between these spheres.\nStep 2:  The molar volume of gold is given as $10.3 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3} / \\mathrm{mole}$.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between activation energy and temperature. The Arrhenius equation relates the rate constant of a process to the activation energy and temperature. The equation is given by:\n\\[ k = Ae^{-\\frac{E_{a}}{RT}} \\]\nwhere:\n- \\(k\\) is the rate constant,\n- \\(A\\) is the pre-exponential factor,\n- \\(E_{a}\\) is the activation energy,\n- \\(R\\) is the gas constant, and\n- \\(T\\) is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nStep 2:  The problem states that the rate constant increases by a factor of three when the temperature is increased from room temperature (20\u00b0C) to 40\u00b0C. We need to find the activation energy \\(E_{a}\\) in kJ/mol, rounded to 1 decimal place.\n\nStep 3:  First, let's convert the temperatures to Kelvin:\n- Room temperature (20\u00b0C) = 20 + 273.15 = 293.15 K\n- Temperature (40\u00b0C) = 40 + 273.15 = 313.15 K\n\nStep 4:  The rate constant at 20\u00b0C is \\(k_1\\) and at 40\u00b0C is \\(3k_1\\). Therefore, we can set up the equation using the Arrhenius equation for both temperatures and then solve for \\(E_{a}\\).\n\nStep 5:  The Arrhenius equation for the two temperatures is:\n\\[ k_1 = Ae^{-\\frac{E_{a}}{RT_1}} \\]\n\\[ 3k_1 = Ae^{-\\frac{E_{a}}{RT_2}} \\]\n\nStep 6:  Dividing the second equation by the first gives:\n\\[ 3 = e^{-\\frac{E_{a}}{RT_2} + \\frac{E_{a}}{RT_1}} \\]\n\nStep 7:  Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\\[ \\ln(3) = -\\frac{E_{a}}{R}\\left(\\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1}\\right) \\]\n\nStep 8:  Rearranging to solve for \\(E_{a}\\):\n\\[ E_{a} = -\\frac{R\\ln(3)}{\\left(\\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1}\\right)} \\]\n\nStep 9:  Plugging in the values:\n- \\(R = 8.314 \\, \\mathrm{J/(mol\\cdot K)}\\)\n- \\(T_1 = 293.15 \\, \\mathrm{K}\\)\n- \\(T_2 = 313.15 \\, \\mathrm{K}\\)\n- \\(\\ln(3) \\approx 1.0986\\)\n\nStep 10:  Calculating the denominator first:\n\\[ \\left(\\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{313.15} - \\frac{1}{293.15}\\right) \\]\n\nStep 11:  Calculating the difference:\n\\[ \\left(\\frac{1}{313.15} - \\frac{1}{293.15}\\right) = \\frac{293.15 - 313.15}{313.15 \\times 293.15} \\]\n\nStep 12:  Calculating the numerator:\n\\[ 293.15 - 313.15 = -20 \\]\n\nStep 13:  Calculating the denominator:\n\\[ 313.15 \\times 293.15 \\approx 91751.3 \\]\n\nStep 14:  Therefore, the denominator is:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{313.15} - \\frac{1}{293.15} = \\frac{-20}{91751.3} \\]\n\nStep 15:  Therefore, the denominator is:\n\\[ \\frac{-20}{91751.3} \\approx -2.18 \\times 10^{-4} \\]\n\nStep 16:  Therefore, the activation energy is:\n\\[ E_{a} = -\\frac{R\\ln(3)}{\\left(\\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1}\\right)} = -\\frac{8.314 \\times 1.0986}{-2.18 \\times 10^{-4}} \\]\n\nStep 17:  Therefore, the activation energy is:\n\\[ E_{a} = \\frac{8.314 \\times 1.0986}{2.18 \\times 10^{-4}} \\]\n\nStep 18:  Therefore, the activation energy is:\n\\[ E_{a} = \\frac{9.136}{2.18 \\times 10^{-4}} \\]\n\nStep 19:  Therefore, the activation energy is:\n\\[ E_{a} = 41851.38 \\, \\mathrm{J/mol} \\]\n\nStep 20:  Converting to kJ/mol:\n\\[ E_{a} = \\frac{41851.38}{1000} \\]\n\nStep 21:  Therefore, the activation energy is:\n\\[ E_{a} = 41.85138 \\, \\mathrm{kJ/mol} \\]\n\nStep 22:  Rounding to 1 decimal place:\n\\[ E_{a} \\approx 41.9 \\, \\mathrm{kJ/mol} \\]\n\nStep 23:  Therefore, the activation energy is approximately 41.9 kJ/mol.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{41.9}",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to calculate the relative electronegativity differences for the systems H-F and C-F. The relative electronegativity difference is given by the formula: \\[\\Delta x = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( E_{A-B} - \\frac{E_{A-A} + E_{B-B}}{2} \\right)\\] where \\(E_{A-B}\\) is the bond energy of the A-B bond, and \\(E_{A-A}\\) and \\(E_{B-B}\\) are the bond energies of the A-A and B-B bonds, respectively.\nStep 2:  First, let's identify the bond energies given in the problem:\n- \\(E_{H_2} = 436 \\, kJ/mol\\)\n- \\(E_{F_2} = 172 \\, kJ/mol\\)\n- \\(E_{C-C} = 335 \\, kJ/mol\\)\n- \\(E_{H-F} = 565 \\, kJ/mol\\)\n- \\(E_{C-H} = 410 \\, kJ/mol\\)\nStep 3:  For the system H-F, we need to calculate \\(\\Delta x_{H-F}\\). Using the formula, we have:\n\\[\\Delta x_{H-F} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( E_{H-F} - \\frac{E_{H_2} + E_{F_2}}{2} \\right)\\]\nStep 4:  Substituting the given values:\n\\[\\Delta x_{H-F} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 565 - \\frac{436 + 172}{2} \\right)\\]\nStep 5:  Calculating the arithmetic:\n\\[\\Delta x_{H-F} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 565 - \\frac{608}{2} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 565 - 304 \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 261 = 130.5\\]\nStep 6:  For the system C-F, we need to calculate \\(\\Delta x_{C-F}\\). Using the formula, we have:\n\\[\\Delta x_{C-F} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( E_{C-F} - \\frac{E_{C-C} + E_{F_2}}{2} \\right)\\]\nStep 7:  However, the bond energy for C-F is not directly given. We need to calculate it using the given bond energies. The bond energy for C-F can be calculated as:\n\\[E_{C-F} = E_{C-H} + E_{H-F} - E_{H_2}\\]\nStep 8:  Substituting the given values:\n\\[E_{C-F} = 410 + 565 - 436 = 539\\]\nStep 9:  Now, we can calculate \\(\\Delta x_{C-F}\\):\n\\[\\Delta x_{C-F} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 539 - \\frac{335 + 172}{2} \\right)\\]\nStep 10:  Calculating the arithmetic:\n\\[\\Delta x_{C-F} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 539 - \\frac{507}{2} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 539 - 253.5 \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 285.5 = 142.75\\]\nStep 11:  Therefore, the relative electronegativity differences are \\(\\Delta x_{H-F} = 130.5\\) and \\(\\Delta x_{C-F} = 142.75\\).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{130.50, 142.75}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of electron-hole pairs in intrinsic germanium (Ge) at a given temperature. The formula provided is:\n\\[n_{i}=9.7 \\times 10^{15} \\mathrm{~T}^{3 / 2} \\mathrm{e}^{-\\mathrm{E}_{g} / 2 \\mathrm{KT}}\\left[\\mathrm{cm}^{3}\\right] \\quad\\left(\\mathrm{E}_{\\mathrm{g}}=0.72 \\mathrm{eV}\\right)\\]\nwhere $n_{i}$ is the number of electron-hole pairs per cubic centimeter, $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin, $E_{g}$ is the bandgap energy in electronvolts, and $K$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nStep 2:  First, we need to convert the given temperature from Celsius to Kelvin. The formula for this conversion is:\n\\[T_{\\mathrm{K}}=T_{\\mathrm{C}}+273.15\\]\nwhere $T_{\\mathrm{C}}$ is the temperature in Celsius and $T_{\\mathrm{K}}$ is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nStep 3:  Given that $T=20^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, we can calculate the temperature in Kelvin as follows:\n\\[T_{\\mathrm{K}}=20+273.15=293.15 \\mathrm{~K}\\]\n\nStep 4:  Next, we need to calculate the value of $E_{g} / 2KT$.

  "Step 1: First, let's write down the given information and the chemical reaction. The reaction is: 2 NaI(aq) + Hg(NO3)2(aq) \u2192 HgI2(s) + 2 NaNO3(aq). We are given 45 mL of 0.10 M Hg(NO3)2 and need to find the volume of 0.25 M NaI required to precipitate all the Hg2+ ions.\n\nStep 2: To find the volume of NaI needed, we first need to calculate the number of moles of Hg2+ ions in the given volume of Hg(NO3)2 solution. The molarity of Hg(NO3)2 is 0.10 M, and the volume is 45 mL. First, convert the volume from mL to L: 45 mL = 0.045 L.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the number of moles of Hg(NO3)2 in 0.045 L of 0.10 M solution. The formula to calculate moles from molarity and volume is: moles = molarity * volume (in liters). So, moles of Hg(NO3)2 = 0.10 M * 0.045 L.\n\nStep 4: Since Hg(NO3)2 dissociates into Hg2+ and 2NO3-, the number of moles of Hg2+ ions will be half the number of moles of Hg(NO3)2 because the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:2 (Hg2+:Hg(NO3)2). Therefore, moles of Hg2+ = moles of Hg(NO3)2 / 2.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the volume of 0.25 M NaI required to precipitate the calculated moles of Hg2+. The reaction requires 2 moles of NaI for every mole of Hg2+, so the moles of NaI needed = 2 * moles of Hg2+. Then, use the formula: volume = moles / molarity to find the volume of NaI required.\n\nStep 6: Perform the calculations:\n- Moles of Hg(NO3)2 = 0.10 M * 0.045 L = 0.0045 mol.\n- Moles of Hg2+ = 0.0045 mol / 2 = 0.00225 mol.\n- Moles of NaI needed = 2 * 0.00225 mol = 0.0045 mol.\n- Volume of NaI = 0.0045 mol / 0.25 M = 0.018 L.\n\nStep 7: Convert the volume from liters to milliliters: 0.018 L = 18 mL.\n\nStep 8: Therefore, the volume of 0.25 M NaI needed to precipitate all the Hg2+ ions from 45 mL of 0.10 M Hg(NO3)2 solution is 18 mL.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{18}",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to apply the concept of diffusion in solids. The problem involves a slab of plate glass containing dissolved helium, which is placed in a vacuum furnace at a temperature of $400^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ to remove the helium. We are asked to find the depth from the surface of the glass at which the concentration of helium has decreased to $1 / 3$ of its initial value after 10 minutes in vacuum at $400^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$.\nStep 2:  First, we need to understand the diffusion equation, which describes how the concentration of a substance changes over time and space in a solid. The equation is given by:\n\\[ \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^{2} C}{\\partial x^{2}} \\]\nwhere $C$ is the concentration of the substance, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, $t$ is time, and $x$ is the distance from the surface.\nStep 3:  Since the problem involves a slab of glass, we can assume that the concentration of helium is constant throughout the glass before vacuum treatment. Therefore, the initial concentration is uniform, and the problem can be treated as a semi-infinite solid with a constant initial concentration.\nStep 4:  The solution to the diffusion equation for a semi-infinite solid with a constant initial concentration is given by:\n\\[ C(x, t) = C_{0} \\text{erfc} \\left( \\frac{x}{2 \\sqrt{Dt}} \\right) \\]\nwhere $C_{0}$ is the initial concentration, $x$ is the distance from the surface, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, and $t$ is time.\nStep 5:  We are given that the concentration of helium has decreased to $1 / 3$ of its initial value, so we can set up the equation:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{3} C_{0} = C_{0} \\text{erfc} \\left( \\frac{x}{2 \\sqrt{Dt}} \\right) \\]\nStep 6:  We can simplify this equation by canceling out $C_{0}$ on both sides, resulting in:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{3} = \\text{erfc} \\left( \\frac{x}{2 \\sqrt{Dt}} \\right) \\]\nStep 7:  To solve for $x$, we need to find the value of $x$ that satisfies this equation. We can use the fact that $\\text{erfc}(x) = 1 - \\text{erf}(x)$, where $\\text{erf}(x)$ is the error function. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\\[ \\text{erfc} \\left( \\frac{x}{2 \\sqrt{Dt}} \\right) = \\frac{1}{3} \\]\nStep 8:  This implies that:\n\\[ 1 - \\text{erf} \\left( \\frac{x}{2 \\sqrt{Dt}} \\right) = \\frac{1}{3} \\]\nStep 9:  Rearranging this equation, we get:\n\\[ \\text{erf} \\left( \\frac{x}{2 \\sqrt{Dt}} \\right) = 1 - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3} \\]\nStep 10:  Therefore, we need to find the value of $x$ such that:\n\\[ \\text{erf} \\left( \\frac{x}{2 \\sqrt{Dt}} \\right) = \\frac{2}{3} \\]\nStep 11:  To solve this equation, we can use the inverse error function, denoted as $\\text{erf}^{-1}(x)$. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\\[ \\frac{x}{2 \\sqrt{Dt}} = \\text{erf}^{-1} \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right) \\]\nStep 12:  Solving for $x$, we get:\n\\[ x = 2 \\sqrt{Dt} \\text{erf}^{-1} \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right) \\]\nStep 13:  Now, we need to find the value of $\\text{erf}^{-1} \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)$. The inverse error function is defined as:\n\\[ \\text{erf}^{-1}(x) = \\frac{1}{2} \\text{erf}^{-1}(2x) \\]\nStep 14:  Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\\[ x = 2 \\sqrt{Dt} \\frac{1}{2} \\text{erf}^{-1} \\left( \\frac{4}{3} \\right) \\]\nStep 15:  Simplifying, we get:\n\\[ x = \\sqrt{Dt} \\text{erf}^{-1} \\left( \\frac{4}{3} \\right) \\]\nStep 16:  Now, we need to find the value of $\\text{erf}^{-1} \\left( \\frac{4}{3} \\right)$. The inverse error function is a special function that can be evaluated numerically. Therefore, we can use a numerical method to find the value of $\\text{erf}^{-1} \\left( \\frac{4}{3} \\right)$.\nStep 17:  After evaluating the inverse error function, we get:\n\\[ \\text{erf}^{-1} \\left( \\frac{4}{3} \\right) \\approx 0.8415 \\]\nStep 18:  Therefore, we can substitute this value into the equation for $x$:\n\\[ x = \\sqrt{Dt} \\times 0.8415 \\]\nStep 19:  Now, we need to find the value of $\\sqrt{Dt}$. We are given that $D = 3.091 \\times 10^{-6} \\mathrm{~cm}^{2} / \\mathrm{s}$ and $t = 10 \\mathrm{~min} = 600 \\mathrm{~s}$.

  "Problem: Determine the energy gap (in eV) between the electronic states $n=7$ and $n=8$ in hydrogen. Please format your answer as $n \\times 10^x$ where $n$ is to 1 decimal place.\n\nStep 1: The energy levels in a hydrogen atom are given by the formula \\(E_n = -\\frac{13.6}{n^2}\\) eV, where \\(n\\) is the principal quantum number. To find the energy gap between the states \\(n=7\\) and \\(n=8\\), we first need to calculate the energies of these states.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the energy of the state \\(n=7\\). Using the formula \\(E_n = -\\frac{13.6}{n^2}\\), substituting \\(n=7\\) gives \\(E_7 = -\\frac{13.6}{7^2} = -\\frac{13.6}{49}\\).\n\nStep 3: Calculate the energy of the state \\(n=8\\). Using the same formula, substituting \\(n=8\\) gives \\(E_8 = -\\frac{13.6}{8^2} = -\\frac{13.6}{64}\\).\n\nStep 4: The energy gap between the two states is the difference between their energies, so \\(\\Delta E = E_8 - E_7\\).\n\nStep 5: Perform the subtraction: \\(\\Delta E = -\\frac{13.6}{64} - \\left(-\\frac{13.6}{49}\\right)\\). To add these fractions, find a common denominator, which is 3136 (64*49). Convert each fraction: \\(\\Delta E = -\\frac{13.6 \\times 49}{3136} + \\frac{13.6 \\times 64}{3136}\\).\n\nStep 6: Calculate each term: \\(\\Delta E = -\\frac{666.4}{3136} + \\frac{870.4}{3136}\\).\n\nStep 7: Add the fractions: \\(\\Delta E = \\frac{666.4 - 870.4}{3136}\\).\n\nStep 8: Perform the subtraction in the numerator: \\(\\Delta E = \\frac{-204}{3136}\\).\n\nStep 9: Simplify the fraction if possible. However, since the numerator is negative and the denominator is positive, the result will be negative. The fraction \\(\\frac{-204}{3136}\\) can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 8. So, \\(\\Delta E = \\frac{-204 \\div 8}{3136 \\div 8} = \\frac{-25.5}{392}\\).\n\nStep 10: Convert the fraction to a decimal and then to scientific notation. The decimal is \\(-0.065\\). To express this in scientific notation, move the decimal point to the right until you have a number between 1 and 10, then multiply by 10 to the power of the number of places you moved the decimal. Here, moving the decimal point 2 places to the right gives 6.5, so the scientific notation is \\(6.5 \\times 10^{-2}\\).\n\nStep 11: Since the problem asks for the answer in the format \\(n \\times 10^x\\) where \\(n\\) is to 1 decimal place, the answer is \\(6.5 \\times 10^{-2}\\). However, the format requires the number before the exponent to be to 1 decimal place, which is already the case here. Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{6.5 \\times 10^{-2}}",
  "Step 1:  To find the maximum age of a sample that can be dated, we need to consider the uncertainty in the decay rate of ${ }^{14} \\mathrm{C}$ and the half-life of the isotope.\nStep 2:  The half-life of ${ }^{14} \\mathrm{C}$ is given as 5730 years. This means that every 5730 years, the amount of ${ }^{14} \\mathrm{C}$ in a sample decreases by half.\nStep 3:  The decay rate of ${ }^{14} \\mathrm{C}$ is given as $15.3$ disintegrations per minute per gram of carbon, with an uncertainty of $\\pm 0.1$ disintegrations per minute per gram of carbon.\nStep 4:  To find the maximum age, we need to consider the maximum possible age that can be determined with the given uncertainty in the decay rate.\nStep 5:  The maximum age is determined by the time it takes for the amount of ${ }^{14} \\mathrm{C}$ to decrease to half of its original value, which is the half-life.\nStep 6:  However, due to the uncertainty in the decay rate, the actual age of the sample may be slightly different from the half-life. Therefore, the maximum age that can be determined is the half-life plus the uncertainty in the decay rate.\nStep 7:  The uncertainty in the decay rate is $\\pm 0.1$ disintegrations per minute per gram of carbon. To convert this to years, we need to calculate the time it takes for the amount of ${ }^{14} \\mathrm{C}$ to decrease by half due to this uncertainty.\nStep 8:  The half-life of ${ }^{14} \\mathrm{C}$ is 5730 years. Therefore, the uncertainty in the decay rate corresponds to a time of $\\frac{5730 \\text{ years}}{15.3 \\text{ disintegrations per minute per gram of carbon}} \\times 0.1 \\text{ disintegrations per minute per gram of carbon}$.\nStep 9:  Calculating this gives us the uncertainty in years, which we can then add to the half-life to find the maximum age.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the maximum age of a sample that can be dated is the half-life plus the uncertainty in years.\n\nNow, let's calculate the uncertainty in years:\n\\[ \\text{Uncertainty in years} = \\frac{5730 \\text{ years}}{15.3 \\text{ disintegrations per minute per gram of carbon}} \\times 0.1 \\text{ disintegrations per minute per gram of carbon} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Uncertainty in years} = \\frac{5730 \\text{ years}}{15.3} \\times 0.1 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Uncertainty in years} = 37.5 \\times 0.1 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Uncertainty in years} = 3.75 \\text{ years} \\]\n\nTherefore, the maximum age of a sample that can be dated is the half-life plus the uncertainty in years:\n\\[ \\text{Maximum age} = 5730 \\text{ years} + 3.75 \\text{ years} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Maximum age} = 5733.75 \\text{ years} \\]\n\nSo, the maximum age of a sample that can be dated is \\boxed{5733.75}",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to use the Born-Land\u00e9 equation, which relates the lattice energy of an ionic compound to the ionic radii of its constituent ions. The equation is given by: \\[ E_{\\text{lattice}} = \\frac{M \\cdot Z^+ \\cdot Z^- \\cdot e^2}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0 r^+ r^-} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{n}\\right) \\] where: - $E_{\\text{lattice}}$ is the lattice energy, - $M$ is the Madelung constant, - $Z^+$ and $Z^-$ are the charges of the cation and anion, respectively, - $e$ is the elementary charge, - $\\epsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity, - $r^+$ and $r^-$ are the ionic radii of the cation and anion, respectively, - $n$ is the Born exponent.

We need to rearrange the Born-Land\u00e9 equation to solve for $r^+$.\n\nStep 2:  First, we need to convert the lattice energy from $\\mathrm{kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$ to $\\mathrm{J}$.

  "Step 1: Understand the problem and the given values.\nThe problem requires calculating the molar crystal energy (\u0394Ecryst) for CsCl using the given ionic radii of Cs+ and Cl-, and the Madelung constant M(CsCl). The formula to calculate the crystal energy is \u0394Ecryst = (M \u00d7 Z \u00d7 e^2) / (4\u03c0\u03b50r), where Z is the number of electrons per formula unit, e is the elementary charge, \u03b50 is the vacuum permittivity, and r is the distance between the ions. However, since the distance between the ions is not given, we need to calculate it first using the ionic radii.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the distance between the ions.\nThe distance between the ions in a crystal lattice can be calculated using the formula r = (r+ + r-) for a simple cubic lattice, where r+ and r- are the ionic radii of the cation and anion, respectively. However, for CsCl, which has a body-centered cubic (BCC) lattice, the distance between ions is given by r = (4/3)^(1/3) \u00d7 (r+ + r-). Therefore, we need to calculate this distance using the given ionic radii.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the distance between ions in CsCl.\nGiven Cs+ = 1.67 \u00c5 and Cl- = 1.81 \u00c5, the distance between ions in CsCl is r = (4/3)^(1/3) \u00d7 (1.67 + 1.81) = (4/3)^(1/3) \u00d7 3.48 = 1.69 \u00c5.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the crystal energy using the formula \u0394Ecryst = (M \u00d7 Z \u00d7 e^2) / (4\u03c0\u03b50r).\nThe Madelung constant M(CsCl) = 1.763, Z = 1 (since CsCl has one formula unit per unit cell), e = 1.602 \u00d7 10^-19 C, \u03b50 = 8.854 \u00d7 10^-12 F/m, and r = 1.69 \u00c5 = 1.69 \u00d7 10^-10 m. Therefore, \u0394Ecryst = (1.763 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 (1.602 \u00d7 10^-19)^2) / (4\u03c0 \u00d7 8.854 \u00d7 10^-12 \u00d7 1.69 \u00d7 10^-10).\n\nStep 5: Perform the calculation.\n\u0394Ecryst = (1.763 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 (1.602 \u00d7 10^-19)^2) / (4\u03c0 \u00d7 8.854 \u00d7 10^-12 \u00d7 1.69 \u00d7 10^-10) = (1.763 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 2.57 \u00d7 10^-38) / (4 \u00d7 3.14159 \u00d7 8.854 \u00d7 10^-12 \u00d7 1.69 \u00d7 10^-10) = 4.53 \u00d7 10^-38 / 5.93 \u00d7 10^-21 = 7.63 \u00d7 10^-18 J.\n\nStep 6: Convert the result to J/mole.\nSince the result is in J, to convert it to J/mole, we need to multiply by Avogadro's number (6.022 \u00d7 10^23). Therefore, \u0394Ecryst = 7.63 \u00d7 10^-18 \u00d7 6.022 \u00d7 10^23 = 459.5 \u00d7 10^5 J/mole = 4.595 \u00d7 10^6 J/mole.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{4.60 \u00d7 10^6}",
  "Step 1: First, let's understand the problem.

Therefore, we can use the formula:\n\n\\[ n = N_d \\]\n\nwhere \\(N_d\\) is the concentration of dopant atoms (boron in this case).\n\nStep 3: The concentration of dopant atoms can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ N_d = \\frac{N_A \\cdot x}{N_A + x} \\]\n\nHowever, since Ge is a semiconductor, the charge carrier density is determined by the number of dopant atoms per unit volume.

  "Problem: What algebraic condition describes a firm that is at an output level that maximizes its profits, given its capital in the short-term?  Use standard acronyms in your condition.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to recall the concept of profit maximization in the short run, which is typically described using the Marginal Revenue (MR) and Marginal Cost (MC) curves.\n\nIn the short run, a firm's production is limited by its fixed capital stock. The firm's profit is given by the difference between its total revenue (TR) and total cost (TC). The total revenue is the product of the output level (Q) and the price per unit (P), i.e., TR = PQ. The total cost is the sum of the fixed cost (FC) and the variable cost (VC), i.e., TC = FC + VC.\n\nThe marginal revenue (MR) is the change in total revenue resulting from a one-unit increase in output, i.e., MR = d(TR)/dQ. The marginal cost (MC) is the change in total cost resulting from a one-unit increase in output, i.e., MC = d(TC)/dQ.\n\nIn the short run, the firm will maximize its profits when the marginal revenue (MR) equals the marginal cost (MC), i.e., MR = MC. This is because, at this point, the additional revenue from producing one more unit is equal to the additional cost of producing that unit, so the firm is neither gaining nor losing profit from producing that unit.\n\nTherefore, the algebraic condition that describes a firm that is at an output level that maximizes its profits, given its capital in the short-term, is:\n\nMR = MC\n\nwhere MR is the marginal revenue and MC is the marginal cost.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{MR = MC}",

  "Solve the following math problem with clear step-by-step reasoning. Write the FINAL numerical answer wrapped inside \\boxed{} at the end followed by a",
  "Step 1: To find the short run industry supply function, we need to first determine the marginal cost (MC) for each firm, since in a competitive market, firms produce up to the point where MC equals the market price (p). The cost function for each firm is given by \\(c_{s}(y) = \\frac{1}{3}y^{3} + 2\\).\n\nStep 2: The marginal cost (MC) is the derivative of the cost function with respect to output (y). So, we need to differentiate \\(c_{s}(y) = \\frac{1}{3}y^{3} + 2\\) to find MC.\n\nStep 3: Differentiating \\(c_{s}(y) = \\frac{1}{3}y^{3} + 2\\) with respect to y gives:\n\\[\nMC = \\frac{d}{dy} \\left(\\frac{1}{3}y^{3} + 2\\right) = y^{2}\n\\]\n\nStep 4: Since each firm is competitive and identical, they will produce up to the point where their MC equals the market price (p). Therefore, for each firm, \\(MC = y^{2} = p\\). However, to find the industry supply function, we need to express the total output supplied by all firms as a function of the market price. Since there are 100 firms, each producing up to the point where their MC equals the market price, the total output supplied by the industry is the sum of the outputs of each firm.\n\nStep 5: Since each firm produces up to the point where \\(y^{2} = p\\), solving for y gives:\n\\[\ny = \\sqrt{p}\n\\]\n\nStep 6: The total output supplied by the industry is the sum of the outputs of each of the 100 firms. Since each firm produces \\(\\sqrt{p}\\), the total output is:\n\\[\nTotal\\ Output = 100 \\times \\sqrt{p}\n\\]\n\nStep 7: Therefore, the short run industry supply function is:\n\\[\ny = 100\\sqrt{p}\n\\]\n\nHowever, the problem asks for the industry supply function in terms of p, but the standard form of a supply function is typically expressed as \\(p = f(y)\\). Therefore, to express the industry supply function in the standard form, we need to solve for p in terms of y.\n\nStep 8: Given \\(y = 100\\sqrt{p}\\), solving for p gives:\n\\[\np = \\left(\\frac{y}{100}\\right)^{2}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the industry supply function in the standard form is:\n\\[\np = \\left(\\frac{y}{100}\\right)^{2}\n\\]\n\nHowever, the problem asks for the industry supply function, which is typically expressed as a function of price (p) to output (y).

  "Step 1: To find the free trade equilibrium price of barley in Moldavia, we need to equate the demand and supply functions and solve for the price. The demand function is given as $Q^{D}=4-P$, where $Q^{D}$ is the quantity demanded and $P$ is the price. The supply function is given as $Q^{S}=P$, where $Q^{S}$ is the quantity supplied.\n\nStep 2: Set the demand and supply functions equal to each other to find the equilibrium price. $Q^{D}=Q^{S}$, so $4-P=P$. This equation needs to be solved for $P$.\n\nStep 3: Solve the equation $4-P=P$ for $P$. First, add $P$ to both sides to get $4=2P$. Then, divide both sides by 2 to solve for $P$. $P=4/2=2$.\n\nStep 4: Therefore, the free trade equilibrium price of barley in Moldavia is $2$ dollars per bushel.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",

  "The marginal rate of substitution (MRS) is the rate at which the consumer is willing to trade one good for another. In this case, the MRS is the rate at which the consumer is willing to trade the first good (x) for the second good (y). The MRS is given by the ratio of the marginal utilities of the two goods. In this case, the marginal utility of the first good is \\frac{1}{2} x^{-\\frac{1}{2}} and the marginal utility of the second good is 1. Therefore, the MRS is:\n\nMRS = -\\frac{\\frac{1}{2} x^{-\\frac{1}{2}}}{1} = -\\frac{1}{2} x^{-\\frac{1}{2}}.\n\nThe consumer's budget constraint is:\n\np x + y = m,\n\nwhere m is the consumer's income, p is the price of the first good, and y is the price of the second good. Since the price of the second good is 1, the budget constraint can be written as:\n\np x + 1 = m.\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = (m - 1)/p.\n\nSince the consumer's income is m > 1/4p, the optimal consumption bundle is the bundle that maximizes the utility function subject to the budget constraint. The first-order conditions for this problem are:\n\n\u2202u/\u2202x = 1/2 x^{-1/2} = \u03bbp,\n\nwhere \u03bb is the Lagrange multiplier. Solving for x, we get:\n\nx = (1/2\u03bbp)^2.\n\nSince the budget constraint is p x + 1 = m, we can substitute x into the budget constraint to get:\n\np (1/2\u03bbp)^2 + 1 = m.\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n(1/4\u03bb^2 p^3) + 1 = m.\n\nSolving for \u03bb, we get:\n\n\u03bb = \u00b1\u221a(4m - 4/p^3).\n\nSince \u03bb > 0 (because the utility function is concave), we take the positive root:\n\n\u03bb = \u221a(4m - 4/p^3).\n\nSubstituting this value of \u03bb into the expression for x, we get:\n\nx = (1/2\u03bbp)^2 = (1/2\u221a(4m -

  "Step 1: Understand the problem and the given information. The problem involves finding the equilibrium price in the apple juice market, given the supply and demand curves. The supply curve is \\(Q_{S} = 10P_{J} - 5P_{A}\\), where \\(P_{J}\\) is the price of apple juice and \\(P_{A}\\) is the price of apples, which is fixed at $1. The demand curve is \\(Q_{D} = 100 - 15P_{J} + 10P_{T}\\), where \\(P_{T}\\) is the price of tea, which is given as $5. We need to find the equilibrium price \\(P_{J}\\) where the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded.\n\nStep 2: Substitute the given values into the supply and demand equations to simplify them.\n\nSupply equation: \\(Q_{S} = 10P_{J} - 5P_{A}\\). Given \\(P_{A} = 1\\), so \\(Q_{S} = 10P_{J} - 5(1) = 10P_{J} - 5\\).\n\nDemand equation: \\(Q_{D} = 100 - 15P_{J} + 10P_{T}\\). Given \\(P_{T} = 5\\), so \\(Q_{D} = 100 - 15P_{J} + 10(5) = 100 - 15P_{J} + 50 = 150 - 15P_{J}\\).\n\nStep 3: Set the supply and demand equations equal to each other to find the equilibrium quantity. Then solve for the equilibrium price.\n\nEquilibrium condition: \\(Q_{S} = Q_{D}\\). So, \\(10P_{J} - 5 = 150 - 15P_{J}\\).\n\nStep 4: Solve the equation for \\(P_{J}\\).\n\nRearrange the equation: \\(10P_{J} + 15P_{J} = 150 + 5\\).\n\nCombine like terms: \\(25P_{J} = 155\\).\n\nDivide both sides by 25: \\(P_{J} = \\frac{155}{25}\\).\n\nStep 5: Calculate the value of \\(P_{J}\\).\n\n\\(P_{J} = \\frac{155}{25} = 6.2\\).\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium price in the apple juice market is $6.20.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{6.2}",
  "Step 1: To find the optimal price that the city of Cambridge should set for apples, we need to consider the supply and demand curves. The city can produce up to 50 apples per day at a marginal cost of 25 cents per apple, and the store can supply any remaining demand at a marginal cost of 75 cents per apple.\n\nStep 2: First, let's calculate the total revenue (TR) and total cost (TC) for the city when it produces x apples. The total revenue is the price per apple times the number of apples sold, and the total cost is the marginal cost times the number of apples produced.\n\nStep 3: The total revenue (TR) is given by TR = P * x, where P is the price per apple and x is the number of apples produced. The total cost (TC) is given by TC = 0.25x, since the marginal cost is 25 cents per apple.\n\nStep 4: The profit (\u03c0) is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost, so \u03c0 = TR - TC = P * x - 0.25x = (P - 0.25)x.\n\nStep 5: Since the city can produce up to 50 apples, the maximum number of apples it can produce is 50. Therefore, the maximum profit is \u03c0_max = (P - 0.25) * 50.\n\nStep 6: The city should set the price at which the demand equals the supply. Since the store supplies any remaining demand, the city should set the price at which the demand equals the supply of 50 apples from the orchard.\n\nStep 7: Let's denote the price as P. The demand is given as 150 apples when the price is 75 cents. Therefore, the demand function is D(P) = 150 when P = 75.\n\nStep 8: However, since the city can produce up to 50 apples, the demand should be equal to 50 when the price is set by the city. Therefore, we need to find the price P such that D(P) = 50.\n\nStep 9: Since the demand function is not explicitly given, we can assume that the demand function is linear. Therefore, we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation: D(P) = m(P - P0) + D0, where m is the slope, P0 is the x-intercept, and D0 is the y-intercept.\n\nStep 10: Since D(75) = 150, we can substitute these values into the equation to get 150 = m(75 - P0) + D0.\n\nStep 11: However, since the demand is 50 when the price is set by the city, we can substitute D(P) = 50 into the equation to get 50 = m(P - P0) + D0.\n\nStep 12: Since the city sets the price, the price P is the x-coordinate, and the demand D(P) is the y-coordinate. Therefore, the point (P, D(P)) = (P, 50) lies on the demand curve.\n\nStep 13: Since the demand curve is linear, the slope m is constant. Therefore, the slope m is the same for all points on the demand curve.\n\nStep 14: Since the demand is 150 when the price is 75, the point (75, 150) lies on the demand curve. Therefore, the slope m can be calculated as m = (D(P2) - D(P1)) / (P2 - P1) = (150 - 50) / (75 - P0).\n\nStep 15: However, since the demand curve is linear, the slope m is constant. Therefore, the slope m is the same for all points on the demand curve.\n\nStep 16: Since the demand is 50 when the price is set by the city, the point (P, 50) lies on the demand curve. Therefore, the slope m can be calculated as m = (D(P2) - D(P1)) / (P2 - P1) = (50 - 0) / (P - 0).\n\nStep 17: However, since the demand curve is linear, the slope m is constant. Therefore, the slope m is the same for all points on the demand curve.\n\nStep 18: Since the demand is 150 when the price is 75, the point (75, 150) lies on the demand curve. Therefore, the slope m can be calculated as m = (D(P2) - D(P1)) / (P2 - P1) = (150 - 0) / (75 - 0) = 2.\n\nStep 19: Therefore, the demand function is D(P) = 2P.\n\nStep 20: Since the demand is 50 when the price is set by the city, we can substitute D(P) = 50 into the equation to get 50 = 2P.\n\nStep 21: Solving for P, we get P = 50 / 2 = 25.\n\nStep 22: Therefore, the city should set the price at 25 cents per apple.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{25}",
  "Step 1: Understand the problem context\nThe problem involves a factory producing cans of peanut butter. The factory faces a market price of $\\$10$ per can. The marginal cost (MC) and average total cost (ATC) are given at two different output levels: $q=5$ and $q=4$. The goal is to determine the tax imposed by Judge Judy as punishment, which is equivalent to either paying a lump sum of profits or imposing a tax of $\\$\\left[P-A T C\\left(q^{*}\\right)\\right]$ per can, where $q^{*}$ is the profit-maximizing output before the lawsuit.\n\nStep 2: Determine the profit-maximizing output\nTo find the profit-maximizing output, we need to compare the marginal revenue (MR) and marginal cost (MC) at different output levels. Since the market price is $\\$10$ per can, the marginal revenue (MR) is also $\\$10$ per can. We need to find the output level where MR = MC.\n\nStep 3: Compare MC and MR at q=5\nAt q=5, MC=10. Since MR=10, MC=MR at q=5. Therefore, q*=5 is the profit-maximizing output.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the profit per can\nThe profit per can is the difference between the market price and the average total cost at the profit-maximizing output. Since q*=5, we need to find ATC(5).\n\nStep 5: Find ATC(5)\nATC(5) is given as 6.\n\nStep 6: Calculate the tax per can\nThe tax per can is the profit per can, which is P - ATC(q*). Therefore, the tax per can is 10 - 6 = 4.\n\nStep 7: Write the final answer\nThe tax imposed by Judge Judy is $\\$4$ per can.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{4}",
  "Step 1: Understand the problem and the given information. We are given two demand functions for strawberries, one for Albie and one for Bubbie.

We need to find Albie's own-price elasticity of demand, \\(\\epsilon_{q_{a}, p}\\), using the formula \\(\\epsilon_{y, x} = \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x} \\frac{x}{y}\\).\n\nStep 2: Identify the variables and parameters involved.

The parameter \\(\\beta\\) is also present in Bubbie's demand function, but it is not directly relevant to Albie's elasticity of demand.\n\nStep 3: Determine the partial derivative of Albie's demand with respect to price, \\(\\frac{\\partial q_{a}}{\\partial p}\\). Since \\(q_{a}(p) = p^{\\alpha} f_{a}(I_{a})\\), using the product rule, we have:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial q_{a}}{\\partial p} = \\alpha p^{\\alpha - 1} f_{a}(I_{a}) + p^{\\alpha} \\frac{\\partial f_{a}(I_{a})}{\\partial p}\n\\]\nHowever, since \\(f_{a}(I_{a})\\) does not explicitly depend on \\(p\\), the second term is zero, so:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial q_{a}}{\\partial p} = \\alpha p^{\\alpha - 1} f_{a}(I_{a})\n\\]\n\nStep 4: Calculate Albie's demand, \\(q_{a}\\), in terms of price, \\(p\\), and income, \\(I_{a}\\).

  "Step 1: Understand the problem and the given information.\nWe are given that the price of steel last year was $\\$ 20$ per ton, and 100 million tons were sold. The own price elasticities of demand and supply are $-0.25$ and $0.5$ respectively. We need to find the equations of demand in this market.\n\nStep 2: Recall the formula for demand and supply curves in terms of price elasticity.\nThe demand curve can be represented as $X_{d} = a - bP$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants. The supply curve can be represented as $X_{s} = c + dP$, where $c$ and $d$ are constants.\n\nStep 3: Recall the relationship between price elasticity and the coefficients of the demand and supply curves.\nThe price elasticity of demand is given by $\\eta_{d} = \\frac{P}{X_{d}} \\frac{dX_{d}}{dP} = -\\frac{P}{X_{d}} \\frac{b}{1}$, where $b$ is the slope of the demand curve. Similarly, the price elasticity of supply is given by $\\eta_{s} = \\frac{P}{X_{s}} \\frac{dX_{s}}{dP} = \\frac{P}{X_{s}} \\frac{d}{1}$.\n\nStep 4: Use the given elasticities to find the slope of the demand and supply curves.\nGiven that the own price elasticity of demand is $-0.25$, we have $\\eta_{d} = -0.25 = -\\frac{P}{X_{d}} \\frac{b}{1}$. Similarly, given that the own price elasticity of supply is $0.5$, we have $\\eta_{s} = 0.5 = \\frac{P}{X_{s}} \\frac{d}{1}$.\n\nStep 5: Use the given price and quantity to find the slope of the demand curve.\nGiven that the price last year was $\\$ 20$ per ton, and 100 million tons were sold, we have $P = 20$ and $X_{d} = 100$. Substituting these values into the demand equation, we have $100 = a - 20b$. Similarly, substituting the supply equation, we have $100 = c + 20d$.\n\nStep 6: Use the given elasticities to find the slope of the demand curve.\nGiven that the own price elasticity of demand is $-0.25$, we have $\\eta_{d} = -0.25 = -\\frac{20}{100} \\frac{b}{1}$. Solving for $b$, we have $b = 0.25 \\times 100 = 25$.\n\nStep 7: Write the equation of demand.\nThe equation of demand is $X_{d} = a - 25P$. To find $a$, we can use the fact that $100 = a - 20 \\times 25$. Solving for $a$, we have $a = 100 + 20 \\times 25 = 100 + 500 = 600$.\n\nStep 8: Write the final equation of demand.\nThe equation of demand is $X_{d} = 600 - 25P$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{600 - 25P}$",

For the $1 s^{2} 2 s^{2}$ configuration, we need to add the Coulomb integrals $\\mathrm{J}_{1 s 2 s}$ and $\\mathrm{J}_{2 s 2 s}$ twice (since there are two electrons in each orbital). For the $1 s^{2} 2 p_{x}^{2}$ configuration, we need to add the Coulomb integrals $\\mathrm{J}_{1 s 2 p}$ and $\\mathrm{J}_{2 p_{x} 2 p_{x}}$ twice, and also add the exchange integrals $\\mathrm{K}_{1 s 2 p}$ and $\\mathrm{K}_{2 p_{x} 2 p_{x}}$ twice.\nStep 6:  The energy difference between the two configurations is given by the difference in their total energies.\nStep 7:  Therefore, we need to calculate the total energy for each configuration and then find the difference between them.\nStep 8:  Let's start by calculating the total energy for the $1 s^{2} 2 s^{2}$ configuration.\nStep 9:  The energy for the $1 s^{2}$ configuration is $2 \\times \\mathrm{J}_{1 s 1 s} = 2 \\times 17.0 Z = 34.0 Z$.\nStep 10:  The energy for the $2 s^{2}$ configuration is $2 \\times \\mathrm{J}_{2 s 2 s} = 2 \\times 3.5 Z = 7.0 Z$.\nStep 11:  The Coulomb integral between the $1 s$ and $2 s$ orbitals is $\\mathrm{J}_{1 s 2 s} = 4.8 Z$. Since there are two electrons in each orbital, we need to add this integral twice, so the total energy contribution from this integral is $2 \\times 4.8 Z = 9.6 Z$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the total energy for the $1 s^{2} 2 s^{2}$ configuration is $34.0 Z + 7.0 Z + 9.6 Z = 50.6 Z$.\nStep 13:  Next, let's calculate the total energy for the $1 s^{2} 2 p_{x}^{2}$ configuration.\nStep 14:  The energy for the $1 s^{2}$ configuration is $2 \\times \\mathrm{J}_{1 s 1 s} = 2 \\times 17.0 Z = 34.0 Z$.\nStep 15:  The energy for the $2 p_{x}^{2}$ configuration is $2 \\times \\mathrm{J}_{2 p_{x} 2 p_{x}} = 2 \\times 3.9 Z = 7.8 Z$.\nStep 16:  The Coulomb integral between the $1 s$ and $2 p_{x}$ orbitals is $\\mathrm{J}_{1 s 2 p} = 6.6 Z$. Since there are two electrons in each orbital, we need to add this integral twice, so the total energy contribution from this integral is $2 \\times 6.6 Z = 13.2 Z$.\nStep 17:  The exchange integral between the $1 s$ and $2 p_{x}$ orbitals is $\\mathrm{K}_{1 s 2 p} = 0.5 Z$. Since there are two electrons in each orbital, we need to add this integral twice, so the total energy contribution from this integral is $2 \\times 0.5 Z = 1.0 Z$.\nStep 18:  Therefore, the total energy for the $1 s^{2} 2 p_{x}^{2}$ configuration is $34.0 Z + 7.8 Z + 13.2 Z + 1.0 Z = 56.0 Z$.\nStep 19:  Finally, the energy difference between the two configurations is given by the difference in their total energies, which is $56.0 Z - 50.6 Z = 5.4 Z$.\nStep 20:  Therefore, the energy difference between the $1 s^{2} 2 p_{x}^{2}$ configuration and the $1 s^{2} 2 s^{2}$ configuration is $5.4 Z$ eV.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5.4Z}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of photons in a given pulse of laser light. The energy of each photon can be calculated using the formula \\(E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}\\), where \\(E\\) is the energy of the photon, \\(h\\) is Planck's constant (\\(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\mathrm{J \\cdot s}\\)), \\(c\\) is the speed of light (\\(3.00 \\times 10^8 \\, \\mathrm{m/s}\\)), and \\(\\lambda\\) is the wavelength of the light.\nStep 2:  First, we need to convert the wavelength from micrometers to meters because the units of Planck's constant and the speed of light are in SI units. So, \\(\\lambda = 1.06 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{m} = 1.06 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\mathrm{m}\\).\nStep 3:  Next, we calculate the energy of each photon using the formula \\(E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}\\). Substituting the given values, we get \\(E = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\mathrm{J \\cdot s}) \\times (3.00 \\times 10^8 \\, \\mathrm{m/s})}{1.06 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\mathrm{m}}\\).\nStep 4:  After calculating the energy of each photon, we can find the number of photons in the pulse by dividing the total energy of the pulse by the energy of each photon. The total energy of the pulse is given as \\(2.00 \\, \\mathrm{mJ} = 2.00 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{J}\\).\nStep 5:  Therefore, the number of photons is calculated as \\(\\frac{2.00 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{J}}{E_{\\text{photon}}}\\), where \\(E_{\\text{photon}}\\) is the energy of each photon calculated in the previous step.\nStep 6:  After performing the calculations, we will obtain the number of photons in the pulse to three significant figures.\n\nNow, let's perform the calculations:\n\nStep 7:  First, calculate the energy of each photon:\n\\[E = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\mathrm{J \\cdot s}) \\times (3.00 \\times 10^8 \\, \\mathrm{m/s})}{1.06 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\mathrm{m}}\\]\n\\[E = \\frac{19.878 \\times 10^{-26} \\, \\mathrm{J \\cdot m}}{1.06 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\mathrm{m}}\\]\n\\[E = 18.73 \\times 10^{-20} \\, \\mathrm{J}\\]\n\\[E = 1.873 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\mathrm{J}\\]\n\nStep 8:  Now, calculate the number of photons:\n\\[N = \\frac{2.00 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{J}}{1.873 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\mathrm{J/photon}}\\]\n\\[N = \\frac{2.00}{1.873} \\times 10^{-3} / 10^{-19}\\]\n\\[N = \\frac{2.00}{1.873} \\times 10^{16}\\]\n\\[N \\approx 1.070 \\times 10^{16}\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of photons in the pulse is approximately \\(1.070 \\times 10^{16}\\) photons.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{1.070e16}",
  "Step 1: First, let's recall the formula that relates the energy of a photon to its wavelength. The energy of a photon is given by \\(E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}\\), where \\(h\\) is Planck's constant, \\(c\\) is the speed of light, and \\(\\lambda\\) is the wavelength of the radiation. We need to calculate the energy of the photons emitted by the ultraviolet radiation.\n\nStep 2: The work function of chromium is given as $4.40 \\mathrm{eV}$. To use this in calculations, we need to convert it into Joules because the energy of the photons will be in Joules. The conversion factor is that $1 \\mathrm{eV} = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{J}$. Therefore, the work function in Joules is $4.40 \\mathrm{eV} \\times 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{J/eV} = 7.0688 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{J}$.\n\nStep 3: Next, we need to calculate the energy of the photons emitted by the ultraviolet radiation. The wavelength of the radiation is given as $200 \\mathrm{~nm}$. First, convert this wavelength to meters because the speed of light is in $\\mathrm{m/s}$. $200 \\mathrm{~nm} = 200 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{m} = 2 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{m}$.\n\nStep 4: Now, calculate the energy of the photons using the formula $E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$. Planck's constant $h = 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{J\\cdot s}$, and the speed of light $c = 3.00 \\times 10^8 \\mathrm{m/s}$. Therefore, the energy of the photons is $E = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{J\\cdot s}) \\times (3.00 \\times 10^8 \\mathrm{m/s})}{2 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{19.878 \\times 10^{-26} \\mathrm{J\\cdot m}}{2 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{m}} = 9.939 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{J}$.\n\nStep 5: The kinetic energy of the electrons emitted from the chromium surface is the difference between the energy of the photons and the work function of chromium. Therefore, the kinetic energy is $E_{\\text{kinetic}} = E_{\\text{photon}} - W$, where $W$ is the work function in Joules. Therefore, $E_{\\text{kinetic}} = 9.939 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{J} - 7.0688 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{J} = 2.8702 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{J}$.\n\nStep 6: Therefore, the kinetic energy of the electrons emitted from the chromium surface is $2.8702 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{J}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2.8702 \\times 10^{-19}}",
  "Step 1: First, let's recall the formula for the energy of a photon, which is given by \\(E_{\\text {photon }} = h \\nu\\), where \\(h\\) is Planck's constant (\\(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J s}\\)) and \\(\\nu\\) is the frequency of the photon. However, since the wavelength is given, we can use the formula \\(\\nu = c / \\lambda\\) to find the frequency first.\n\nStep 2: The wavelength of the photon is given as \\(500 \\, \\text{nm}\\). First, convert this wavelength to meters because the speed of light is in meters per second. The conversion factor is that \\(1 \\, \\text{nm} = 10^{-9} \\, \\text{m}\\).\n\nStep 3: Calculate the frequency \\(\\nu\\) using the formula \\(\\nu = c / \\lambda\\), where \\(c = 3 \\times 10^{8} \\, \\text{m/s}\\) and \\(\\lambda = 500 \\, \\text{nm} = 500 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\text{m}\\).\n\nStep 4: Once we have the frequency, we can calculate the energy of the photon using \\(E_{\\text {photon }} = h \\nu\\).\n\nStep 5: Finally, use the formula \\(p_{\\text {photon }} = E_{\\text {photon }} / c\\) to find the momentum of the photon. Since the energy is in Joules and the speed of light is in meters per second, the momentum will be in kilogram meters per second (kg m/s) because \\(1 \\, \\text{J} = 1 \\, \\text{kg m}^2 / \\text{s}^2\\), and dividing by \\(c\\) (in m/s) gives kg m/s.\n\nStep 6: Perform the calculations:\n\n- Convert wavelength to meters: \\(500 \\, \\text{nm} = 500 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\text{m} = 5 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{m}\\).\n\n- Calculate frequency: \\(\\nu = c / \\lambda = (3 \\times 10^{8} \\, \\text{m/s}) / (5 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{m}) = 6 \\times 10^{14} \\, \\text{Hz}\\).\n\n- Calculate energy: \\(E_{\\text {photon }} = h \\nu = (6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J s}) \\times (6 \\times 10^{14} \\, \\text{Hz}) = 3.9756 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J}\\).\n\n- Calculate momentum: \\(p_{\\text {photon }} = E_{\\text {photon }} / c = (3.9756 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J}) / (3 \\times 10^{8} \\, \\text{m/s}) = 1.3222 \\times 10^{-27} \\, \\text{kg m/s}\\).\n\nStep 7: Round the momentum to three decimal places: \\(1.322 \\times 10^{-27} \\, \\text{kg m/s}\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{1.322 \\times 10^{-27}}",

However, for a cyclic system like benzene, the determinant can be simplified using the fact that the matrix is symmetric and the determinant can be expressed in terms of the trace and the determinant of the submatrix.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to calculate the de Broglie wavelength of a baseball given its mass, velocity, and diameter. The de Broglie wavelength is given by the formula \\(\\lambda = \\frac{h}{p} = \\frac{h}{m \\nu}\\), where \\(h\\) is Planck's constant, \\(m\\) is the mass of the baseball, and \\(\\nu\\) is its velocity.\nStep 2:  First, we need to convert the given values into SI units. The mass is given in grams, so we need to convert it to kilograms. The velocity is given in nanometers per second, so we need to convert it to meters per second. The diameter is given in centimeters, so we need to convert it to meters.\nStep 3:  Planck's constant \\(h\\) is approximately \\(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{J \\cdot s}\\). The mass of the baseball is \\(145 \\mathrm{g} = 0.145 \\mathrm{kg}\\). The velocity is \\(1 \\mathrm{nm/s} = 1 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{m/s}\\). The diameter is \\(7.4 \\mathrm{cm} = 0.074 \\mathrm{m}\\).\nStep 4:  However, the diameter is not needed for the calculation of the de Broglie wavelength. Therefore, we can ignore the diameter for this calculation.\nStep 5:  Now, we can plug the values into the formula \\(\\lambda = \\frac{h}{m \\nu}\\) to find the de Broglie wavelength.\nStep 6:  Substituting the values, we get \\(\\lambda = \\frac{6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{J \\cdot s}}{0.145 \\mathrm{kg} \\times 1 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{m/s}}\\).\nStep 7:  Calculating this, we get \\(\\lambda = \\frac{6.626 \\times 10^{-34}}{1.45 \\times 10^{-11}}\\).\nStep 8:  Simplifying, we get \\(\\lambda = 4.57 \\times 10^{-23} \\mathrm{m}\\).\nStep 9:  Therefore, the de Broglie wavelength of the baseball is approximately \\(4.57 \\times 10^{-23} \\mathrm{m}\\).\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{4.57e-23}",

  "Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem involves a superposition state wavefunction, $\\psi_{1,2}$, which is a linear combination of two eigenstates, $\\psi_{1}$ and $\\psi_{2}$, with corresponding eigen-energies $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$. The coefficients of the linear combination are $(1 / 3)^{1 / 2}$ and $(2 / 3)^{1 / 2}$, respectively. The task is to determine the possible results of measuring the energy of this superposition state.\n\nStep 2: Recall the principles of quantum measurement\nIn quantum mechanics, when a measurement is made on a system in a superposition state, the act of measurement causes the system to collapse to one of the possible eigenstates. The probability of collapsing to a particular eigenstate is given by the square of the absolute value of the coefficient of that eigenstate in the superposition.\n\nStep 3: Apply the principles to the given superposition state\nThe superposition state is given by:\n\\[\n\\psi_{1,2}=(1 / 3)^{1 / 2} \\psi_{1}+(2 / 3)^{1 / 2} \\psi_{2}\n\\]\nThe coefficients are $(1 / 3)^{1 / 2}$ and $(2 / 3)^{1 / 2}$, respectively. To find the possible results of measuring the energy, we need to consider the eigen-energies $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ associated with the eigenstates $\\psi_{1}$ and $\\psi_{2}$, respectively.\n\nStep 4: Determine the possible measurement outcomes\nWhen the measurement is made, the system will collapse to either $\\psi_{1}$ or $\\psi_{2}$, each with a certain probability. The probability of collapsing to $\\psi_{1}$ is given by the square of the absolute value of the coefficient of $\\psi_{1}$, which is $(1 / 3)^{1 / 2}$. Similarly, the probability of collapsing to $\\psi_{2}$ is given by the square of the absolute value of the coefficient of $\\psi_{2}$, which is $(2 / 3)^{1 / 2}$.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the probabilities\nThe probability of collapsing to $\\psi_{1}$ is:\n\\[\nP(\\psi_{1}) = \\left| (1 / 3)^{1 / 2} \\right|^2 = (1 / 3)\n\\]\nThe probability of collapsing to $\\psi_{2}$ is:\n\\[\nP(\\psi_{2}) = \\left| (2 / 3)^{1 / 2} \\right|^2 = (2 / 3)\n\\]\n\nStep 6: List the possible measurement outcomes\nSince the system can collapse to either $\\psi_{1}$ or $\\psi_{2}$, the possible measurement outcomes are the corresponding eigen-energies $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$.\n\nStep 7: Write the final answer\nThe possible measurement outcomes are the eigen-energies $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$, each with probabilities $(1 / 3)$ and $(2 / 3)$, respectively.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{E1 with probability 1/3, E2 with probability 2/3}",

The matrix is\n\\[\n\\mathbf{H}=\\hbar \\omega\\left(\\begin{array}{ccc}\n10 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 2 \\\\\n0 & 2 & -10\n\\end{array}\\right)\n\\]\nWe need to find the eigen-energies and eigen-functions, label them according to the dominant basis state character, and then use non-degenerate perturbation theory to calculate the energy $E_{\\widetilde{10}}$ to second order.\n\nStep 2: Solution Strategy\nTo solve this problem, we will first diagonalize the matrix $\\mathbf{H}$ to find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Then, we will identify the eigen-energies and eigen-functions according to the dominant basis state character. After that, we will use non-degenerate perturbation theory to calculate the energy $E_{\\widetilde{10}}$ to second order in the perturbing Hamiltonian.\n\nStep 3: Diagonalize the Matrix\nTo diagonalize the matrix $\\mathbf{H}$, we need to find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. We can do this by solving the characteristic equation $|\\mathbf{H} - E\\mathbf{I}| = 0$, where $\\mathbf{I}$ is the identity matrix.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the matrix H\nH = np.array([[10, 1, 0], [1, 0, 2], [0, 2, -10]])\n\n# Diagonalize the matrix H\neigenvalues, eigenvectors = np.linalg.eig(H)\n\n# Print the eigenvalues and eigenvectors\nprint(\"Eigenvalues: \", eigenvalues)\nprint(\"Eigenvectors: \", eigenvectors)\n```\n\nStep 4: Identify Eigen-energies and Eigen-functions\nAfter diagonalizing the matrix, we get the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. We need to identify the eigen-energies and eigen-functions according to the dominant basis state character.\n\n```python\n# Identify the eigen-energies and eigen-functions\neigenvalues = np.round(eigenvalues, 1)\neigenvectors = np.round(eigenvectors, 1)\n\n# Print the eigen-energies and eigen-functions\nprint(\"Eigen-energies: \", eigenvalues)\nprint(\"Eigen-functions: \", eigenvectors)\n```\n\nStep 5: Use Non-degenerate Perturbation Theory\nNow, we need to use non-degenerate perturbation theory to calculate the energy $E_{\\widetilde{10}}$ to second order in the perturbing Hamiltonian.\n\n```python\n# Define the perturbing Hamiltonian\nV = np.array([[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]])\n\n# Calculate the energy E_{\\widetilde{10}} to second order\nE_10 = eigenvalues[0]\nV_10 = np.dot(eigenvectors[:, 0], np.dot(V, eigenvectors[:, 0]))\nE_10_1 = E_10 + V_10\nV_10_1 = np.dot(eigenvectors[:, 0], np.dot(V, eigenvectors[:, 0]))\nV_10_2 = np.dot(eigenvectors[:, 0], np.dot(V, np.dot(eigenvectors[:, 0], np.dot(V, eigenvectors[:, 0]))))\nE_10_2 = E_10_1 + V_10_2\n\n# Print the energy E_{\\widetilde{10}} to second order\nprint(\"Energy E_{\\widetilde{10}} to second order: \", E_10_2)\n```\n\nStep 6: Round to One Decimal Place\nFinally, we need to round the energy $E_{\\widetilde{10}}$ to second order to one decimal place.\n\n```python\n# Round the energy E_{\\widetilde{10}} to second order to one decimal place\nE_10_2 = round(E_10_2, 1)\n\n# Print the final answer\nprint(\"The final answer is \\boxed{\" + str(E_10_2) + \"}."
