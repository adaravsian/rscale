  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of relative motion and how to calculate the distance between two objects moving towards each other.\nStep 2:  First, we know that Alicia and Beth are initially 45 miles apart, with Alicia in City A and Beth in City B.\nStep 3:  Alicia bikes towards City B at a speed of 18 miles per hour, while Beth bikes towards City A at a speed of 12 miles per hour.\nStep 4:  Since they are moving towards each other, we can consider their combined speed as the sum of their individual speeds, which is 18 + 12 = 30 miles per hour.\nStep 5:  The time it takes for them to meet can be calculated using the formula time = distance / speed. In this case, the distance is 45 miles, and the combined speed is 30 miles per hour.\nStep 6:  Therefore, the time it takes for them to meet is 45 / 30 = 1.5 hours.\nStep 7:  Now, to find the distance from City A where they will meet, we need to calculate the distance covered by Alicia in 1.5 hours. Since Alicia's speed is 18 miles per hour, the distance covered in 1.5 hours is 18 * 1.5 = 27 miles.\nStep 8:  Therefore, when they meet, Alicia will be 27 miles from City A.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{27}$",
  "Problem: Positive real numbers $x$ and $y$ satisfy $y^3=x^2$ and $(y-x)^2=4y^2$. What is $x+y$? Step 1:  We are given two equations involving positive real numbers $x$ and $y$: $y^3=x^2$ and $(y-x)^2=4y^2$.\nStep 2:  The first equation is $y^3=x^2$, which can be rewritten as $x^2=y^3$. This implies that $x$ is the square root of $y^3$, and since $x$ is positive, we have $x=y^{\\frac{3}{2}}$.\nStep 3:  The second equation is $(y-x)^2=4y^2$. Expanding this, we get $y^2-2yx+x^2=4y^2$. Rearranging, we have $x^2-2yx-3y^2=0$.\nStep 4:  We can treat this as a quadratic equation in terms of $x$, with $y$ as a constant. The quadratic formula gives us $x=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$, where $a=1$, $b=-2y$, and $c=-3y^2$.\nStep 5:  Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get $x=\\frac{2y\\pm\\sqrt{(-2y)^2-4(1)(-3y^2)}}{2(1)}$. Simplifying, we have $x=\\frac{2y\\pm\\sqrt{4y^2+12y^2}}{2}$, which further simplifies to $x=\\frac{2y\\pm\\sqrt{16y^2}}{2}$.\nStep 6:  This gives us $x=\\frac{2y\\pm4y}{2}$. So, we have two possible values for $x$: $x=3y$ or $x=-y$.\nStep 7:  Since $x$ is positive, we discard the negative solution, so $x=3y$.\nStep 8:  Substituting $x=3y$ into the equation $y^3=x^2$, we get $y^3=(3y)^2$, which simplifies to $y^3=9y^2$.\nStep 9:  Dividing both sides by $y^2$, we get $y=9$. Substituting $y=9$ into $x=3y$, we get $x=3(9)=27$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the sum of $x$ and $y$ is $x+y=27+9=36$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{36}$",
  "Problem: What is the degree measure of the acute angle formed by lines with slopes $2$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$?\n\nStep 1:  To find the degree measure of the acute angle formed by two lines with slopes $2$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$, we can use the formula for the angle between two lines given their slopes.\nStep 2:  The formula for the angle $\\theta$ between two lines with slopes $m_1$ and $m_2$ is given by $\\tan \\theta = \\left| \\frac{m_1 - m_2}{1 + m_1 m_2} \\right|$.\nStep 3:  In this case, the slopes of the two lines are $2$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$, so we can substitute these values into the formula to find the angle $\\theta$.\nStep 4:  Plugging in the values, we get $\\tan \\theta = \\left| \\frac{2 - \\frac{1}{3}}{1 + 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}} \\right|$.\nStep 5:  Simplifying the expression inside the absolute value, we have $\\tan \\theta = \\left| \\frac{\\frac{5}{3}}{\\frac{5}{3}} \\right|$.\nStep 6:  The absolute value of $\\frac{5}{3}$ is $\\frac{5}{3}$, so we have $\\tan \\theta = \\frac{5}{3}$.\nStep 7:  Now, we need to find the angle $\\theta$ whose tangent is $\\frac{5}{3}$.\nStep 8:  The angle whose tangent is $\\frac{5}{3}$ is the angle whose sine and cosine are $\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{34}}$ and $\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{34}}$ respectively.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the angle $\\theta$ is given by $\\theta = \\arctan \\left( \\frac{5}{3} \\right)$.\nStep 10:  Using a calculator or trigonometric table, we find that $\\arctan \\left( \\frac{5}{3} \\right) \\approx 59.036$ degrees.\nStep 11:  However, we need to find the acute angle, so we take the smaller angle between the two possible angles.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the degree measure of the acute angle formed by lines with slopes $2$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ is $\\boxed{59}$ degrees.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{59}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to calculate the value of the given expression, which involves a series of cubes of consecutive numbers.\nStep 2:  The expression is a sum of terms in the form of $n^3 - (n-1)^3$, where $n$ ranges from $2$ to $18$.\nStep 3:  We can simplify each term by factoring the difference of cubes, which gives us $n^3 - (n-1)^3 = (n^3 - (n-1)^3) = (n - (n-1)) \\cdot (n^2 + (n-1)^2 + n \\cdot (n-1))$.\nStep 4:  Simplifying further, we get $n^3 - (n-1)^3 = (1) \\cdot (n^2 + (n-1)^2 + n \\cdot (n-1)) = n^2 + (n-1)^2 + n \\cdot (n-1)$.\nStep 5:  This simplification allows us to rewrite the given expression as a sum of these simplified terms.\nStep 6:  We can then calculate the sum of these terms for $n$ ranging from $2$ to $18$.\nStep 7:  The sum of the terms can be expressed as $\\sum_{n=2}^{18} (n^2 + (n-1)^2 + n \\cdot (n-1))$.\nStep 8:  We can further simplify this expression by expanding the terms and then summing them up.\nStep 9:  After expanding and simplifying, we get the expression as $\\sum_{n=2}^{18} (n^2 + (n-1)^2 + n \\cdot (n-1)) = \\sum_{n=2}^{18} (n^2 + n^2 - 2n + 1 + n^2 - n)$.\nStep 10:  Simplifying further, we get $\\sum_{n=2}^{18} (n^2 + n^2 - 2n + 1 + n^2 - n) = \\sum_{n=2}^{18} (3n^2 - 3n + 1)$.\nStep 11:  We can then calculate the sum of these terms for $n$ ranging from $2$ to $18$.\nStep 12:  After calculating the sum, we get the final value of the expression.\nStep 13:  Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{185)",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given information and set up equations to represent the relationships between the number of games won by left-handed and right-handed players.\nStep 2:  Let's denote the number of left-handed players as $L$ and the number of right-handed players as $R$. We are given that there are twice as many right-handed players as left-handed players, so $R = 2L$.\nStep 3:  The total number of games played can be represented as the sum of the number of games played by left-handed players and the number of games played by right-handed players. Since every participant played every other participant exactly once, the total number of games played is given by the combination formula $\\binom{L+R}{2}$.\nStep 4:  We are also given that the number of games won by left-handed players was $40\\%$ more than the number of games won by right-handed players. This can be represented as $1.4R = L$.\nStep 5:  We can use these equations to solve for the total number of games played. First, we can express $R$ in terms of $L$ using the equation $R = 2L$. Then, we can substitute this expression for $R$ into the equation $1.4R = L$ to solve for $L$.\nStep 6:  Once we have the value of $L$, we can use the combination formula to find the total number of games played, which is $\\binom{L+R}{2} = \\binom{L+2L}{2} = \\binom{3L}{2}$.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the total number of games played is $\\binom{3L}{2} = \\frac{(3L)(3L-1)}{2}$.\nStep 8:  We can now substitute the value of $L$ into this expression to find the total number of games played.\nStep 9:  After solving for $L$, we can substitute this value into the expression $\\frac{(3L)(3L-1)}{2}$ to find the total number of games played.\nStep 10:  This will give us the final answer for the total number of games played in the tournament.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{135}$",

So, $z=x+yi$, where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers.\nStep 3:  Substituting $z=x+yi$ into the given equation, we get $|1+(x+yi)+(x+yi)^{2}|=4$. Expanding this, we have $|1+(x+yi)+(x^{2}-y^{2}+2xyi)|=4$.\nStep 4:  Simplifying further, we get $|x^{2}+y^{2}+x+yi+2xyi|=4$. This can be written as $|(x^{2}+y^{2}+x)+i(y+x+2xy)|=4$.\nStep 5:  Using the definition of the modulus of a complex number, we have $\\sqrt{(x^{2}+y^{2}+x)^{2}+(y+x+2xy)^{2}}=4$.\nStep 6:  Squaring

In any one jump, independent of previous jumps, Flora leaps a positive integer distance $m$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2^m}$.\nStep 3:  We are interested in finding the probability that Flora will eventually land at 10. This means we need to consider all possible sequences of jumps that result in Flora reaching 10.\nStep 4:  To approach this, we can use the concept of a generating function, which is a formal power series that encodes the probability distribution of the number of jumps required to reach 10.\nStep 5:  The generating function for the number of jumps is given by $f(x) = \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^m}{2^m}$, where $x$ represents the number of jumps.\nStep 6:  We can simplify this generating function to obtain $f(x) = \\frac{x}{2-x}$.\nStep 7:  The probability that Flora will eventually land at 10 is given by the coefficient of $x^{10}$ in the expansion of $f(x)$.\nStep 8:  To find this coefficient, we can use the binomial theorem to expand $\\frac{x}{2-x}$ and then extract the coefficient of $x^{10}$.\nStep 9:  After simplifying the expression, we find that the probability is $\\frac{1}{2^9}$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the probability that Flora will eventually land at 10 is $\\frac{1}{2^9}$.\nStep 11:  The final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{512}}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given information and set up an equation to represent the situation.\nStep 2:  We are told that the weight of $\\frac{1}{3}$ of a large pizza together with $3 \\frac{1}{2}$ cups of orange slices is the same as the weight of $\\frac{3}{4}$ of a large pizza together with $\\frac{1}{2}$ cup of orange slices.\nStep 3:  We also know that a cup of orange slices weighs $\\frac{1}{4}$ of a pound. This information will be crucial in setting up the equation.\nStep 4:  Let's denote the weight of a large pizza as $p$ pounds. Then, the weight of $\\frac{1}{3}$ of a large pizza is $\\frac{1}{3}p$ pounds, and the weight of $\\frac{3}{4}$ of a large pizza is $\\frac{3}{4}p$ pounds.\nStep 5:  The weight of $3 \\frac{1}{2}$ cups of orange slices is $3 \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{7}{4}$ pounds, and the weight of $\\frac{1}{2}$ cup of orange slices is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{8}$ pounds.\nStep 6:  Therefore, the weight of $\\frac{1}{3}$ of a large pizza together with $3 \\frac{1}{2}$ cups of orange slices is $\\frac{1}{3}p + \\frac{7}{4}$ pounds, and the weight of $\\frac{3}{4}$ of a large pizza together with $\\frac{1}{2}$ cup of orange slices is $\\frac{3}{4}p + \\frac{1}{8}$ pounds.\nStep 7:  Since these two weights are equal, we can set up the equation $\\frac{1}{3}p + \\frac{7}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}p + \\frac{1}{8}$.\nStep 8:  To solve for $p$, we need to isolate the variable. First, let's multiply the entire equation by 24 to clear the fractions: $24 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{3}p + \\frac{7}{4} \\right) = 24 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{3}{4}p + \\frac{1}{8} \\right)$.\nStep 9:  This simplifies to $8p + 42 = 18p + 3$.\nStep 10:  Next, let's isolate the variable $p$ by subtracting $8p$ from both sides: $42 = 10p + 3$.\nStep 11:  Then, subtract 3 from both sides: $39 = 10p$.\nStep 12:  Finally, divide both sides by 10 to solve for $p$: $p = \\frac{39}{10}$.\nStep 13:  Therefore, the weight of a large pizza is $\\frac{39}{10}$ pounds.\nStep 14:  The question asks for the difference between the numerator and denominator, so we need to find $m - n$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.\nStep 15:  In this case, $m = 39$ and $n = 10$, so $m - n = 39 - 10 = 29$.\nStep 16:  Therefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{29}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{29}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve for $f(2023)$, we need to understand the given functional equation and find a way to express $f(n)$ in terms of $n$.\nStep 2:  The functional equation provided is $\\sum_{d\\mid n}d\\cdot f\\left(\\frac{n}{d}\\right)=1$ for all positive integers $n$.\nStep 3:  We are given that $f(1) = 1$, which is a crucial piece of information to start solving the problem.\nStep 4:  We can use the functional equation to find $f(2)$ by substituting $n = 2$ into the equation. This gives us $1 \\cdot f(2) + 2 \\cdot f(1) = 1$, which simplifies to $f(2) + 2 = 1$, leading to $f(2) = -1$.\nStep 5:  Next, we substitute $n = 4$ into the functional equation to find $f(4)$. This gives us $1 \\cdot f(4) + 2 \\cdot f(2) + 4 \\cdot f(1) = 1$, which simplifies to $f(4) + 2(-1) + 4 = 1$, leading to $f(4) = 1 - 2 - 4 = -5$.\nStep 6:  We can continue this process to find $f(8)$ by substituting $n = 8$ into the functional equation. This gives us $1 \\cdot f(8) + 2 \\cdot f(4) + 4 \\cdot f(2) + 8 \\cdot f(1) = 1$, which simplifies to $f(8) + 2(-5) + 4(-1) + 8 = 1$, leading to $f(8) = 1 - 10 - 4 + 8 = -5$.\nStep 7:  We can see a pattern emerging where $f(2^n) = -5$ for all positive integers $n$.\nStep 8:  Now, we need to find $f(2023)$. Since $2023 = 7 \\cdot 17 \\cdot 17$, we can express $2023$ as a product of prime powers.\nStep 9:  We can use the functional equation to find $f(2023)$ by substituting $n = 2023$ into the equation. This gives us $\\sum_{d\\mid 2023}d\\cdot f\\left(\\frac{2023}{d}\\right)=1$.\nStep 10:  We can break down the sum into the product of prime powers, which gives us $f(2023) = f(7 \\cdot 17 \\cdot 17) = f(7) \\cdot f(17) \\cdot f(17)$.\nStep 11:  We can find $f(7)$ by substituting $n = 7$ into the functional equation, which gives us $1 \\cdot f(7) + 7 \\cdot f(1) = 1$, leading to $f(7) = 1 - 7 = -6$.\nStep 12:  We can find $f(17)$ by substituting $n = 17$ into the functional equation, which gives us $1 \\cdot f(17) + 17 \\cdot f(1) = 1$, leading to $f(17) = 1 - 17 = -16$.\nStep 13:  Therefore, $f(2023) = f(7) \\cdot f(17) \\cdot f(17) = (-6) \\cdot (-16) \\cdot (-16) = -6 \\cdot 256 = -1536$.\nStep 14:  Hence, $f(2023) = \\boxed{-1536}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-1536}$",

This is because if $n$ is a perfect square and $n = m^2$, then $m$ is the square root of $n$. If $m$ is divisible by $5$, then $n$ is also divisible by $5$.\nStep 3:  We need to find the number of positive integers less than $\\sqrt{2023}$ that are divisible by $5$. This is because the square of any integer less than $\\sqrt{2023}$ will be less than $2023$.\nStep 4:  To find the number of positive integers less than $\\sqrt{2023}$ that are divisible by $5$, we can find the largest integer less than $\\sqrt{2023}$ and then count the multiples of $5$ up to that integer.\nStep 5:  The largest integer less than $\\sqrt{2023}$ is $44$ because $45^2 = 2025$, which is greater than $2023$.\nStep 6:  Now, we need to count the multiples of $5$ up to $44$.

  "Problem: How many digits are in the base-ten representation of $8^5 \\cdot 5^{10} \\cdot 15^5$?\nStep 1:  To find the number of digits in the base-ten representation of $8^5 \\cdot 5^{10} \\cdot 15^5$, we first need to understand the prime factorization of the given expression.\nStep 2:  The expression $8^5 \\cdot 5^{10} \\cdot 15^5$ can be broken down into its prime factors. We know that $8 = 2^3$, $5$ is already a prime number, and $15 = 3 \\cdot 5$. So, we can rewrite the expression as $(2^3)^5 \\cdot 5^{10} \\cdot (3 \\cdot 5)^5$.\nStep 3:  Simplifying this, we get $2^{15} \\cdot 5^{10} \\cdot 3^5 \\cdot 5^5$. Further simplifying, we have $2^{15} \\cdot 5^{15} \\cdot 3^5$.\nStep 4:  Now, we need to find the number of digits in the base-ten representation of this product. To do this, we can use the fact that the number of digits in a number is related to its logarithm. Specifically, the number of digits in a number $n$ is equal to the floor of $\\log_{10} n$ plus 1.\nStep 5:  So, we need to find the value of $\\log_{10} (2^{15} \\cdot 5^{15} \\cdot 3^5)$ and then take the floor of that value plus 1 to get the number of digits.\nStep 6:  Using the properties of logarithms, we can simplify this to $\\log_{10} (2^{15} \\cdot 5^{15} \\cdot 3^5) = 15 \\log_{10} 2 + 15 \\log_{10} 5 + 5 \\log_{10} 3$.\nStep 7:  Now, we can use the fact that $\\log_{10} 2 \\approx 0.301$, $\\log_{10} 5 \\approx 0.699$, and $\\log_{10} 3 \\approx 0.477$ to approximate the value of the expression.\nStep 8:  Substituting these values, we get $15 \\cdot 0.301 + 15 \\cdot 0.699 + 5 \\cdot 0.477 \\approx 4.515 + 10.485 + 2.385 \\approx 17.385$.\nStep 9:  Taking the floor of this value, we get $\\lfloor 17.385 \\rfloor = 17$.\nStep 10:  Finally, adding 1 to this value, we get $17 + 1 = 18$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the number of digits in the base-ten representation of $8^5 \\cdot 5^{10} \\cdot 15^5$ is $\\boxed{18}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{18}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that Janet's running total will equal 3 at some point during her 4 rolls of a standard 6-sided die.\nStep 2:  We can approach this problem by considering the different ways in which Janet's running total can equal 3. This can happen in the first roll, the second roll, the third roll, or the fourth roll.\nStep 3:  First, let's consider the case where the running total equals 3 in the first roll. The only way this can happen is if Janet rolls a 3 on the first roll. The probability of rolling a 3 on a single roll is $\\frac{1}{6}$.\nStep 4:  Next, we consider the case where the running total equals 3 in the second roll. This can happen if Janet rolls a 1 on the first roll and a 2 on the second roll, or if she rolls a 2 on the first roll and a 1 on the second roll. The probability of rolling a 1 and then a 2, or rolling a 2 and then a 1, is $\\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{2}{36}$.\nStep 5:  Then, we consider the case where the running total equals 3 in the third roll. This can happen if Janet rolls a 1 on the first roll, a 1 on the second roll, and a 1 on the third roll. The probability of rolling a 1 three times in a row is $\\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{216}$.\nStep 6:  Finally, we consider the case where the running total equals 3 in the fourth roll. This can happen if Janet rolls a 1 on the first three rolls and a 1 on the fourth roll. The probability of rolling a 1 four times in a row is $\\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{1296}$.\nStep 7:  Now, we need to add up the probabilities of all these cases to find the total probability that Janet's running total will equal 3 at some point during her 4 rolls.\nStep 8:  The total probability is $\\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{2}{36} + \\frac{1}{216} + \\frac{1}{1296}$.\nStep 9:  To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 1296. So, we convert each fraction to have a denominator of 1296.\nStep 10:  $\\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{216}{1296}$, $\\frac{2}{36} = \\frac{72}{1296}$, $\\frac{1}{216} = \\frac{6}{1296}$, and $\\frac{1}{1296} = \\frac{1}{1296}$.\nStep 11:  Now, we can add these fractions: $\\frac{216}{1296} + \\frac{72}{1296} + \\frac{6}{1296} + \\frac{1}{1296} = \\frac{295}{1296}$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the probability that Janet's running total will equal 3 at some point during her 4 rolls is $\\frac{295}{1296}$.\nStep 13:  The final answer is: $\\boxed{295}$",
  "Step 1:  The problem involves finding the positive difference between the x-coordinates of points A and B, which lie on the graph of y = log2x. The midpoint of the line segment AB is given as (6, 2).\nStep 2:  To start, we need to understand the relationship between the coordinates of points A and B and the midpoint. The midpoint formula states that the coordinates of the midpoint of a line segment with endpoints (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2).\nStep 3:  Given that the midpoint is (6, 2), we can use the midpoint formula to express the coordinates of A and B as (x1, log2x1) and (x2, log2x2), respectively.\nStep 4:  Substituting the midpoint coordinates into the midpoint formula, we get ((x1 + x2)/2, (log2x1 + log2x2)/2) = (6, 2).\nStep 5:  From this, we can equate the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates separately to get two equations: (x1 + x2)/2 = 6 and (log2x1 + log2x2)/2 = 2.\nStep 6:  Simplifying the first equation, we get x1 + x2 = 12. The second equation can be rewritten as log2(x1 * x2) = 4, which implies x1 * x2 = 2^4 = 16.\nStep 7:  We now have a system of equations: x1 + x2 = 12 and x1 * x2 = 16. We can solve this system to find the values of x1 and x2.\nStep 8:  Solving the system of equations, we find that x1 = 8 and x2 = 4 (or vice versa, as the order of the points doesn't matter).\nStep 9:  The positive difference between the x-coordinates of A and B is |x1 - x2| = |8 - 4| = 4.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the positive difference between the x-coordinates of A and B is 4.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to consider the possible dates in the year 2023 and determine for how many of these dates each digit appears an even number of times in the 8-digit display.\nStep 2:  First, we note that the year 2023 is a special case because it has a 2 in the thousands place, a 0 in the hundreds place, a 2 in the tens place, and a 3 in the ones place. This means that the digit 2 appears 3 times, and the digit 0 appears 1 time, and the digit 3 appears 1 time.\nStep 3:  We are looking for dates where each digit appears an even number of times. This means that the digit 2 must appear an even number of times, the digit 0 must appear an even number of times, and the digit 3 must appear an even number of times.\nStep 4:  Since the year 2023 has a 2 in the thousands place, a 0 in the hundreds place, a 2 in the tens place, and a 3 in the ones place, the digit 2 appears 3 times, and the digit 0 appears 1 time, and the digit 3 appears 1 time. This means that the digit 2 appears an odd number of times, the digit 0 appears an odd number of times, and the digit 3 appears an odd number of times.\nStep 5:  Therefore, the only possible dates in

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the mean of Maureen's quiz scores and her individual scores.\nStep 2:  Let's denote the current mean of her quiz scores as $x$. The total sum of her quiz scores so far is $nx$, where $n$ is the number of quizzes she has taken.\nStep 3:  If Maureen scores an $11$ on the next quiz, her new mean will be $x+1$. This means that the total sum of her quiz scores will increase by $11$, so the new total sum will be $nx+11$.\nStep 4:  Therefore, we can set up the equation $nx+11 = n(x+1)$, which simplifies to $nx+11 = nx+n$. This equation represents the relationship between the current mean, the new mean, and the score on the next quiz.\nStep 5:  If Maureen scores an $11$ on each of the next three quizzes, her new mean will be $x+2$. This means that the total sum of her quiz scores will increase by $33$, so the new total sum will be $nx+33$.\nStep 6:  Therefore, we can set up the equation $nx+33 = n(x+2)$, which simplifies to $nx+33 = nx+2n$. This equation represents the relationship between the current mean, the new mean, and the scores on the next three quizzes.\nStep 7:  We can solve these equations to find the current mean of her quiz scores.\nStep 8:  First, we can simplify the equation $nx+11 = nx+n$ to $11 = n$, which means that the number of quizzes she has taken is $11$.\nStep 9:  Then, we can simplify the equation $nx+33 = nx+2n$ to $33 = 2n$, which means that the number of quizzes she has taken is $16.5$.\nStep 10:  However, the number of quizzes cannot be a fraction, so we need to re-evaluate the equations.\nStep 11:  Let's re-evaluate the equations by considering the relationship between the mean and the total sum of scores.\nStep 12:  If Maureen scores an $11$ on the next quiz, her new mean will be $x+1$, so the total sum of her quiz scores will increase by $11$. This means that the new total sum will be $nx+11$.\nStep 13:  If Maureen scores an $11$ on each of the next three quizzes, her new mean will be $x+2$, so the total sum of her quiz scores will increase by $33$.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the fraction of juice that Mrs. Jones must pour from each of the first three glasses into the fourth glass so that all four glasses will have the same amount of juice.\nStep 2:  Let's assume that the total capacity of each glass is $1$ unit. Mrs. Jones fills the first three glasses completely, so each of them has $1$ unit of juice. However, when she pours juice into the fourth glass, she only fills it $\\frac{1}{3}$ full, meaning the fourth glass has $\\frac{1}{3}$ unit of juice.\nStep 3:  The total amount of juice in the four glasses is $3$ units (from the first three glasses) plus $\\frac{1}{3}$ unit (from the fourth glass), which equals $\\frac{10}{3}$ units.\nStep 4:  To distribute the juice evenly among the four glasses, we need to divide the total amount of juice, $\\frac{10}{3}$ units, by $4$ glasses. This gives us $\\frac{10}{3} \\div 4 = \\frac{10}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{10}{12} = \\frac{5}{6}$ units in each glass.\nStep 5:  Since the first three glasses are full, each has $1$ unit of juice. To make each glass have $\\frac{5}{6}$ units, Mrs. Jones needs to pour $\\frac{5}{6} - 1 = -\\frac{1}{6}$ units from each of the first three glasses into the fourth glass.\nStep 6:  However, since we can't pour a negative amount of juice, we need to adjust the amount to be poured. The fourth glass has $\\frac{1}{3}$ unit of juice, and we want it to have $\\frac{5}{6}$ units. So, the amount to be poured from each of the first three glasses into the fourth glass is $\\frac{5}{6} - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{5}{6} - \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}$ unit.\nStep 7:  Therefore, Mrs. Jones must pour $\\frac{1}{2}$ unit from each of the first three glasses into the fourth glass.\nStep 8:  The final answer is $m+n = 1+2 = 3$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the points of intersection between the two circles and then determine the slope of the line passing through these points.\nStep 2:  The first circle has a radius of $4$ and its center lies on the positive $x$-axis. Since it is tangent to the $y$-axis at the origin, its center must be at $(4,0)$.\nStep 3:  The second circle has a radius of $10$ and its center lies on the positive $y$-axis. Since it is tangent to the $x$-axis at the origin, its center must be at $(0,10)$.\nStep 4:  The equation of the first circle is $(x-4)^2 + y^2 = 16$, and the equation of the second circle is $x^2 + (y-10)^2 = 100$.\nStep 5:  To find the points of intersection, we need to solve the system of equations formed by the two circle equations.\nStep 6:  We can start by expanding the first circle equation to get $x^2 - 8x + 16 + y^2 = 16$, which simplifies to $x^2 - 8x + y^2 = 0$.\nStep 7:  Similarly, expanding the second circle equation gives $x^2 + y^2 - 20y + 100 = 100$, which simplifies to $x^2 + y^2 - 20y = 0$.\nStep 8:  Subtracting the first equation from the second equation gives $20y - 8x = 0$, which can be rearranged to get $y = \\frac{2}{5}x$.\nStep 9:  This equation represents the line passing through the points of intersection of the two circles.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the slope of this line is $\\frac{2}{5}$.\nStep 11:  The final answer is the sum of the numerator and denominator of the slope, which is $2+5=7$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum area of an isosceles trapezoid with legs of length $1$ and one base twice as long as the other.\nStep 2:  Let's denote the length of the shorter base as $x$. Then, the length of the longer base is $2x$. The height of the trapezoid is denoted as $h$.\nStep 3:  We can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate the height $h$ with the length of the legs and the bases. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\nStep 4:  In this case, we have a right-angled triangle formed by the height $h$, half the difference between the bases ($2x - x = x$), and the leg of length $1$. So, we have $h^2 + \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^2 = 1^2$.\nStep 5:  Solving for $h$, we get $h = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{x^2}{4}}$.\nStep 6:  The area of the trapezoid is given by the formula $A = \\frac{1}{2}(b_1 + b_2)h$, where $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the lengths of the bases and $h$ is the height.\nStep 7:  Substituting the values, we get $A = \\frac{1}{2}(x + 2x)\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{x^2}{4}} = \\frac{3x}{2}\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{x^2}{4}}$.\nStep 8:  To find the maximum area, we need to maximize the expression $A = \\frac{3x}{2}\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{x^2}{4}}$.\nStep 9:  We can do this by finding the critical points of the function and then determining the maximum value.\nStep 10:  To find the critical points, we take the derivative of the function with respect to $x$ and set it equal to zero.\nStep 11:  After finding the critical points, we can use the second derivative test to determine whether the critical points correspond to a maximum or minimum.\nStep 12:  Once we have the maximum area, we can express it in the form $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.\nStep 13:  Finally, we need to find $m^2 + n^2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{57}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given binary operation $\\otimes$ and how it applies to complex numbers.\nStep 2:  The operation $u \\otimes v = ac + bdi$ is defined for complex numbers $u = a+bi$ and $v = c+di$. Here, $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are real numbers, and $i$ is the imaginary unit, where $i^2 = -1$.\nStep 3:  We are given that $z$ is a complex number such that $z\\otimes z = z^{2}+40$. We need to find the value of $|z|^2$, where $|z|$ denotes the modulus or absolute value of the complex number $z$.\nStep 4:  Let's represent the complex number $z$ as $z = a+bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers.\nStep 5:  According to the given operation, $z\\otimes z = (a+bi)\\otimes (a+bi) = a^2 + b^2i^2 = a^2 - b^2 + 2abi$.\nStep 6:  We are also given that $z\\otimes z = z^{2}+40$. So, we have $a^2 - b^2 + 2abi = (a+bi)^2 + 40$.\nStep 7:  Expanding the right-hand side, we get $a^2 - b^2 + 2abi = a^2 + 2abi - b^2 + 40$.\nStep 8:  Equating the real and imaginary parts, we get two equations: $a^2 - b^2 = a^2 - b^2 + 40$ and $2ab = 2ab$.\nStep 9:  From the first equation, we can see that $40 = 0$, which is not possible. However, we can simplify the equation to $0 = 40$, which is a contradiction.\nStep 10:  This means that the given equation $z\\otimes z = z^{2}+40$ has no solution for $z$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, we cannot find the value of $|z|^2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

  "Problem: For how many ordered pairs $(a,b)$ of integers does the polynomial $x^3+ax^2+bx+6$ have $3$ distinct integer roots?\nStep 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ordered pairs $(a,b)$ of integers for which the polynomial $x^3+ax^2+bx+6$ has $3$ distinct integer roots.\nStep 2:  We can start by considering the properties of the roots of a polynomial. If a polynomial has $3$ distinct integer roots, then the product of these roots must be equal to the constant term of the polynomial, which is $6$ in this case.\nStep 3:  The constant term $6$ can be expressed as the product of three distinct integers in the following ways: $1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3$, $1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 6$, $1 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 6$, and $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 6$.\nStep 4:  However, we need to consider the Vieta's formulas, which state that the sum of the roots of a polynomial is equal to the negation of the coefficient of the second-highest degree term, and the product of the roots is equal to the constant term.\nStep 5:  For the polynomial $x^3+ax^2+bx+6$, the sum of the roots is $-a$, and the product of the roots is $6$.\nStep 6:  We can use these relationships to find the possible values of $a$ and $b$ for each of the four cases of distinct integer roots.\nStep 7:  For the case $1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3$, the sum of the roots is $6$, so $-a = 6$, which gives $a = -6$. The product of the roots is $6$, so $1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 = 6$, which is consistent with the polynomial.\nStep 8:  For the case $1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 6$, the sum of the roots is $9$, so $-a = 9$, which gives $a = -9$. The product of the roots is $12$, which is not equal to $6$, so this case is not valid.\nStep 9:  For the case $1 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 6$, the sum of the roots is $10$, so $-a = 10$, which gives $a = -10$. The product of the roots is $18$, which is not equal to $6$, so this case is not valid.\nStep 10:  For the case $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 6$, the sum of the roots is $11$, so $-a = 11$, which gives $a = -11$. The product of the roots is $36$, which is not equal to $6$, so this case is not valid.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the only valid case is $1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3$, which gives $a = -6$ and $b = 6$.\nStep 12:  Hence, there is only $\\boxed{1}$ ordered pair $(a,b)$ of integers for which the polynomial $x^3+ax^2+bx+6$ has $3$ distinct integer roots.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the value of the most expensive item in Coinland that cannot be purchased using the available coins with exact change.\nStep 2:  The available coin values are $6, 10,$ and $15$ cents. We need to determine the maximum value of an item that cannot be purchased using these coins.\nStep 3:  We can start by considering the possible combinations of coins that can be used to make change for a given amount.

But we can also make change for $15$ cents using one $10$-cent coin and one $5$-cent coin. Since we don't have a $5$-cent coin, we can't make change for $15$ cents using the available coins.\nStep 5:  Therefore, the maximum value of an item that cannot be purchased using the available coins is $15$ cents.\nStep 6:  However, we need to check if there are any other values that cannot be purchased using the available coins. We can do this by considering the combinations of coins that can be used to make change for a given amount.\nStep 7:  For example, if we have a coin of value $6$ cents, we can make change for $6$ cents using one $6$-cent coin. Similarly, if we have a coin of value $10$ cents, we can make change for $10$ cents using one $10$-cent coin.\nStep 8:  However, if we have a coin of value $15$ cents, we can make change for $15$ cents using one $15$-cent coin.

He has a budget of $$43$.\nStep 2:  To find the original price of the most expensive shoes he can afford, we need to work backwards from the final price he can afford, which is the discounted price plus the sales tax.\nStep 3:  Let's denote the original price of the shoes as $x$. After a $20\\%$ discount, the price becomes $0.8x$.\nStep 4:  Then, a $7.5\\%$ sales tax is added to this discounted price, making the final price $1.075(0.8x)$.\nStep 5:  We know that Carlos can afford a final price of $43$ dollars. So, we can set up the equation $1.075(0.8x) = 43$ to find the original price $x$.\nStep 6:  Solving for $x$, we get $0.8x = \\frac{43}{1.075}$.\nStep 7:  Therefore, $x = \\frac{43}{1.075} \\div 0.8$.\nStep 8:  Calculating this, we get $x = \\frac{43}{1.075} \\times \\frac{1}{0.8} = \\frac{43}{0.85}$.\nStep 9:  So, the original price of the most expensive shoes he can afford is $\\frac{43}{0.85}$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the original price is $\\boxed{50.588}$",

How many square centimeters of paper could Jackson cover with paint?\nStep 1:  First, we need to understand the problem and what is being asked. Jackson has a paintbrush that creates a narrow strip with a width of $6.5$ millimeters. He has enough paint to make a strip that is $25$ meters long. We need to find out how many square centimeters of paper Jackson could cover with paint.\nStep 2:  To solve this problem, we need to convert the length of the strip from meters to millimeters, as the width is given in millimeters. We know that $1$ meter is equal to $1000$ millimeters, so $25$ meters is equal to $25 \\times 1000 = 25000$ millimeters.\nStep 3:  Now, we need to find the area of the strip, which is the product of its length and width. The length of the strip is $25000$ millimeters, and the width is $6.5$ millimeters. So, the area of the strip is $25000 \\times 6.5 = 162500$ square millimeters.\nStep 4:  However, the question asks for the area in square centimeters. We know that $1$ centimeter is equal to $10$ millimeters, so $1$ square centimeter is equal to $10 \\times 10 = 100$ square millimeters. Therefore, to convert the area from square millimeters to square centimeters, we divide by $100$. So, the area in square centimeters is $162500 \\div 100 = 1625$ square centimeters.\nStep 5:  Therefore, Jackson could cover $1625$ square centimeters of paper with paint.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1625}$",

  "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem asks us to determine the number of disjoint open intervals on the number line that remain after removing the roots of the given polynomial $P(x)$. The polynomial is defined as the product of $(x-1)^1 (x-2)^2 (x-3)^3 \\cdot \\cdot \\cdot (x-10)^{10}$.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the roots of the polynomial\nThe roots of the polynomial are the values of $x$ that make $P(x) = 0$. These are the points where the polynomial changes sign. From the given polynomial, we can see that the roots are $x = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 10$.\n\n## Step 3: Understand the concept of disjoint open intervals\nWhen the roots are removed from the number line, the remaining intervals are open, meaning they do not include the endpoints. These intervals are disjoint, meaning they do not overlap. The number of disjoint open intervals is equal to the number of roots plus one, because each root divides the number line into two intervals.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the number of disjoint open intervals\nSince there are 10 roots, the number of disjoint open intervals is $10 + 1 = 11$.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the sign of P(x) on each interval\nTo determine the sign of $P(x)$ on each interval, we need to consider the sign of the polynomial at the endpoints of each interval.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the values of $n$ for which the given expression represents a real number. The expression involves logarithms and square roots, so we need to carefully analyze the conditions under which the expression is defined and real-valued.\nStep 2:  The expression involves the base $10$ logarithm, denoted as $\\log$. We need to consider the domain of the logarithmic function, which is all positive real numbers. Therefore, $n$ must be a positive real number for the expression to be defined.\nStep 3:  The expression involves a square root, so the radicand must be non-negative for the expression to be real-valued. This means that $\\frac{\\log (n^2) - (\\log n)^2}{\\log n - 3} \\geq 0$.\nStep 4:  We can simplify the expression by using the properties of logarithms. Specifically, $\\log (n^2) = 2 \\log n$ and $(\\log n)^2 = (\\log n)(\\log n)$. Therefore, the expression becomes $\\frac{2 \\log n - (\\log n)^2}{\\log n - 3}$.\nStep 5:  To simplify further, we can factor the numerator as $2 \\log n - (\\log n)^2 = (\\log n)(2 - \\log n)$. Therefore, the expression becomes $\\frac{(\\log n)(2 - \\log n)}{\\log n - 3}$.\nStep 6:  We can cancel out the common factor of $\\log n$ from the numerator and denominator, but we need to be careful about the domain. The expression is undefined when $\\log n = 3$, so we need to exclude $n = 10^3 = 1000$ from the domain.\nStep 7:  After canceling out the common factor, the expression becomes $2 - \\log n$. However, we need to consider the domain of the logarithmic function, which is all positive real numbers. Therefore, $n$ must be a positive real number for the expression to be defined.\nStep 8:  The expression $2 - \\log n$ is defined for all positive real numbers $n$. However, we need to consider the condition that the expression must be non-negative for the square root to be real-valued. Therefore, $2 - \\log n \\geq 0$.\nStep 9:  Solving the inequality $2 - \\log n \\geq 0$, we get $\\log n \\leq 2$. Therefore, $n \\leq 10^2 = 100$.\nStep 10:  However, we also need to consider the condition that $n$ must be a positive integer. Therefore, $n$ must be a positive integer less than or equal to $100$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the expression represents a real number for all positive integers $n$ such that $1 \\leq n \\leq 100$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the number of integers $n$ for which the expression represents a real number is $100$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{100}$",
  "Problem: How many nonempty subsets $B$ of ${0, 1, 2, 3, \\cdots, 12}$ have the property that the number of elements in $B$ is equal to the least element of $B$? For example, $B = {4, 6, 8, 11}$ satisfies the condition.\nStep 1:  The problem asks us to find the number of nonempty subsets $B$ of the set ${0, 1, 2, 3, \\cdots, 12}$ such that the number of elements in $B$ is equal to the least element of $B$.\nStep 2:  To approach this problem, we need to consider the possible sizes of subsets and the corresponding least elements that satisfy the given condition.\nStep 3:  We can start by considering the possible sizes of subsets, which range from 1 to 12, as the least element of the subset must be equal to the number of elements in the subset.\nStep 4:  For each possible size of the subset, we need to determine the number of subsets that satisfy the condition.\nStep 5:  For example, for a subset of size 1, the least element must be 1, and there is only one subset with this property, which is $\\{1\\}$.\nStep 6:  Similarly, for a subset of size 2, the least element must be 2, and there are $\\binom{10}{2}$ subsets with this property, as we need to choose 2 elements from the remaining 10 elements in the set.\nStep 7:  We can continue this process for each possible size of the subset, from 1 to 12, and calculate the number of subsets that satisfy the condition for each size.\nStep 8:  By summing up the number of subsets for each size, we can find the total number of nonempty subsets $B$ that satisfy the given property.\nStep 9:  Therefore, we need to calculate the number of subsets for each size from 1 to 12 and then sum them up to find the total number of subsets that satisfy the condition.\n\nStep 10:  Now, let's calculate the number of subsets for each size from 1 to 12 and then sum them up to find the total number of subsets that satisfy the condition.\n\nStep 11:  For size 1, the least element

elements from the remaining 8 elements in the set.\n\nStep 15:  For size 5, the least element must be 5, and there are $\\binom{7}{5}$ subsets with this property, as we need to choose 5 elements from the remaining 7 elements in the set.\n\nStep 16:  For size 6, the least element must be 6, and there are $\\binom{6}{6}$ subsets with this property, as we need to choose 6 elements from the remaining 6 elements in the set.\n\nStep 17:  For size 7, the least element must be 7, and there are $\\binom{5}{7}$ subsets with this property, as we need to choose 7 elements from the remaining 5 elements in the set.\n\nStep 18:  For size 8, the least element must be 8, and there are $\\binom{4}{8}$ subsets with this property, as we need to choose 8 elements from the remaining 4 elements in the set.\n\nStep 19:  For size 9, the least element must be 9, and there are $\\binom{3}{9}$ subsets with this property, as we need to choose 9 elements from the remaining 3 elements in the set.\n\nStep 20:  For size 10, the least element must be 10, and there are $\\binom{2}{10}$ subsets with this property, as we need to choose 10 elements from the remaining 2 elements in the set.\n\nStep 21:  For size 11, the least element must be 11, and there are $\\binom{1}{11}$ subsets with this property, as we need to choose 11 elements from the remaining 1 element in the set.\n\nStep 22:  For size 12, the least element must be 12, and there are $\\binom{0}{12}$ subsets with this property, as we need to choose 12 elements from the remaining 0 elements in the set.\n\nStep 23:  Now, let's calculate the number of subsets for each size from 1 to 12 and then sum them up to find the total number of subsets that satisfy the condition.\n\nStep 24:  For size 1, the number of subsets is 1.\n\nStep 25:  For size 2, the number of subsets is $\\binom{10}{2} = 45$.\n\nStep 26:  For size 3, the number of subsets is $\\binom{9}{3} = 84$.\n\nStep 27:  For size 4, the number of subsets is $\\binom{8}{4} = 70$.\n\nStep 28:  For size 5, the number of subsets is $\\binom{7}{5} = 21$.\n\nStep 29:  For size 6, the number of subsets is $\\binom{6}{6} = 1$.\n\nStep 30:  For size 7, the number of subsets is $\\binom{5}{7} = 0$.\n\nStep 31:  For size 8, the number of subsets is $\\binom{4}{8} = 0$.\n\nStep 32:  For size 9, the number of subsets is $\\binom{3}{9} = 0$.\n\nStep 33:  For size 10, the number of subsets is $\\binom{2}{10} = 0$.\n\nStep 34:  For size 11, the number of subsets is $\\binom{1}{11} = 0$.\n\nStep 35:  For size 12, the number of subsets is $\\binom{0}{12} = 0$.\n\nStep 36:  Now, let's sum up the number of subsets for each size from 1 to 12 to find the total number of subsets that satisfy the condition.\n\nStep 37:  The total number of subsets is $1 + 45 + 84 + 70 + 21 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 222$.\n\nStep 38:  Therefore, the total number of nonempty subsets $B$ of ${0, 1, 2, 3, \\cdots, 12}$ that have the property that the number of elements in $B$ is equal to the least element of $B$ is 222.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{222}$",
  "Step 1:  The given problem involves finding the area of a region in the coordinate plane defined by the inequality $| | x | - 1 | + | | y | - 1 | \\le 1$.\nStep 2:  To approach this problem, we first need to understand the nature of the inequality and how it defines the region in the coordinate plane.\nStep 3:  The inequality involves absolute values, which means the region will be defined by the intersection of multiple half-planes.\nStep 4:  We can start by analyzing the inequality $| | x | - 1 | + | | y | - 1 | \\le 1$ and try to break it down into simpler inequalities.\nStep 5:  We can consider the cases where $x \\ge 0$ and $x < 0$ separately, as the absolute value function changes its behavior based on the sign of the input.\nStep 6:  For $x \\ge 0$, the inequality becomes $| x - 1 | + | y - 1 | \\le 1$, and for $x < 0$, it becomes $| -x - 1 | + | y - 1 | \\le 1$.\nStep 7:  We can further simplify these inequalities by considering the cases where $y \\ge 0$ and $y < 0$ separately.\nStep 8:  By analyzing these cases, we can determine the boundaries of the region defined by the inequality and then find the area of the region.\nStep 9:  The region defined by the inequality is a square with vertices at $(0,0)$, $(2,0)$, $(2,2)$, and $(0,2)$.\nStep 10:  The area of a square is given by the formula $A = s^2$, where $s$ is the length of a side.\nStep 11:  In this case, the length of a side is $2$, so the area of the region is $A = 2^2 = 4$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the area of the region defined by the inequality $| | x | - 1 | + | | y | - 1 | \\le 1$ is $\\boxed{4}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$"
