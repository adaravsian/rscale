  "Step 1:  First, we need to understand the given problem. We are dealing with the Magellan telescopes, each with a diameter of $6.5 \\mathrm{~m}$. The effective focal length of the telescopes in one configuration is $72 \\mathrm{~m}$. We are asked to find the diameter of the image of a planet at this focus, given that the angular diameter of the planet at the time of observation is $45^{\\prime \\prime}$.\nStep 2:  To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of angular diameter and the relationship between the angular diameter, the diameter of the telescope, and the focal length.\nStep 3:  The angular diameter of an object is related to its actual diameter and the distance to the object. In this case, the angular diameter of the planet is given as $45^{\\prime \\prime}$, and we need to find the actual diameter of the image of the planet at the focus of the telescope.\nStep 4:  We can use the formula for the angular diameter of an object: $\\theta=\\frac{d}{D}$, where $\\theta$ is the angular diameter, $d$ is the actual diameter of the object, and $D$ is the distance to the object.\nStep 5:  In this case, the angular diameter of the planet is $45^{\\prime \\prime}$, and the distance to the planet is the focal length of the telescope, which is $72 \\mathrm{~m}$.\nStep 6:  We can rearrange the formula to solve for the actual diameter of the image of the planet: $d=\\theta D$.\nStep 7:  Plugging in the values, we get $d=45^{\\prime \\prime} \\times 72 \\mathrm{~m}$.\nStep 8:  To convert the angular diameter from seconds of arc to radians, we use the conversion factor: $1^{\\prime \\prime}=\\frac{1}{3600} \\mathrm{rad}$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, $45^{\\prime \\prime}=\\frac{45}{3600} \\mathrm{rad}=\\frac{1}{80} \\mathrm{rad}$.\nStep 10:  Now, we can calculate the actual diameter of the image of the planet: $d=\\frac{1}{80} \\mathrm{rad} \\times 72 \\mathrm{~m}$.\nStep 11:  This gives us $d=0.9 \\mathrm{~m}$.\nStep 12:  To convert this to centimeters, we multiply by $100$: $d=0.9 \\mathrm{~m} \\times 100 \\mathrm{~cm} / 1 \\mathrm{~m}=90 \\mathrm{~cm}$.\nStep 13:  Therefore, the diameter of the image of the planet at the focus of the telescope is $90 \\mathrm{~cm}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{90}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to calculate the luminosity of the white dwarf star, which is treated as a blackbody radiator.\nStep 2:  The luminosity of a blackbody radiator is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the luminosity (power output) is proportional to the fourth power of the effective temperature of the object.\nStep 3:  The formula for the luminosity of a blackbody is $L = 4 \\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$, where $L$ is the luminosity, $R$ is the radius of the object, $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the effective temperature.\nStep 4:  We

  "Step 1:  To find the critical angle for the light to be internally reflected at $H$, we need to consider the refraction of light as it passes from the glass into the air.\nStep 2:  The critical angle is the angle of incidence above which total internal reflection occurs. This happens when the angle of refraction is $90^{\\circ}$.\nStep 3:  We are given that the index of refraction of the glass is $n=1.5$. When light passes from the glass into the air, the angle of refraction is given by Snell's law: $n_1 \\sin \\theta_1 = n_2 \\sin \\theta_2$, where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the indices of refraction of the two media, and $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$ are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.\nStep 4:  In this case, $n_1 = 1.5$ (glass) and $n_2 = 1$ (air). We want to find the critical angle, which is the angle of incidence $\\theta_1$ when $\\theta_2 = 90^{\\circ}$.\nStep 5:  Using Snell's law, we have $1.5 \\sin \\theta_1 = 1 \\sin 90^{\\circ} = 1$. Therefore, $\\sin \\theta_1 = \\frac{1}{1.5} = \\frac{2}{3}$.\nStep 6:  To find the critical angle, we need to find the angle whose sine is $\\frac{2}{3}$. This can be done using the inverse sine function: $\\theta_1 = \\sin^{-1} \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)$.\nStep 7:  Using a calculator, we find that $\\sin^{-1} \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right) \\approx 41.81^{\\circ}$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the critical angle for the light to be internally reflected at $H$ is approximately $41.81^{\\circ}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{41.8}$",

  "## Step 1: Recall Snell's law\nSnell's law states that the ratio of the sines of the angles of incidence and refraction is equal to the ratio of the velocities of the two media, or equivalently, the inverse ratio of the indices of refraction. Mathematically, this is expressed as $n_1 \\sin{\\theta_1} = n_2 \\sin{\\theta_2}$, where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the indices of refraction of the two media, and $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$ are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.\n\n## Step 2: Apply Snell's law to the given problem\nIn this problem, the light is incident on the surface of the water at an angle $\\theta_w$ with respect to the surface normal. The index of refraction of water is given as $n=1.3$. We want to find the angle of the light once it emerges from the water into the air, $\\theta_a$. Using Snell's law, we have $1.3 \\sin{\\theta_w} = \\sin{\\theta_a}$.\n\n## Step 3: Solve for $\\theta_a$\nTo find $\\theta_a$, we need to isolate $\\sin{\\theta_a}$ in the equation. Dividing both sides of the equation by 1.3, we get $\\sin{\\theta_a} = \\frac{1.3 \\sin{\\theta_w}}{1.3} = \\sin{\\theta_w}$. However, this is not correct. We need to take the inverse sine of both sides to solve for $\\theta_a$. So, $\\theta_a = \\arcsin{1.3 \\sin{\\theta_w}}$.\n\n## Step 4: Find the critical angle\nThe critical angle is the critical value of $\\theta_w$ such that the light will not emerge from the water. This occurs when $\\sin{\\theta_a} = 1$, which means that $\\sin{\\theta_w} = \\frac{1}{1.3}$. Therefore, the critical angle is $\\theta_w = \\arcsin{\\frac{1}{1.3}}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\arcsin{\\frac{1}{1.3}}}$",
  "Step 1:  To find the theoretical limiting angular resolution of the telescope, we can use the Rayleigh criterion, which states that the minimum angle between two point sources that can be resolved is given by $\\theta = 1.22 \\frac{\\lambda}{D}$, where $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of light and $D$ is the diameter of the telescope.\nStep 2:  Given that the diameter of the telescope is 8 inches, we need to convert this to meters to match the units of the wavelength. Since $1 \\mathrm{~inch} = 2.54 \\mathrm{~cm}$, the diameter in meters is $8 \\times 2.54 \\times 10^{-2} \\mathrm{~m} = 0.2032 \\mathrm{~m}$.\nStep 3:  The wavelength of light is given as $5 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~m}$.\nStep 4:  Now, we can substitute these values into the Rayleigh criterion formula to find the limiting angular resolution.\nStep 5:  Plugging in the values, we get $\\theta = 1.22 \\frac{5 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~m}}{0.2032 \\mathrm{~m}}$.\nStep 6:  Simplifying this expression, we get $\\theta = 1.22 \\times 2.46 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~rad}$.\nStep 7:  To convert this to arcseconds, we use the conversion factor $1 \\mathrm{~rad} = 206265 \\mathrm{~arcsec}$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, $\\theta = 1.22 \\times 2.46 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~rad} \\times 206265 \\mathrm{~arcsec/rad}$.\nStep 9:  Calculating this, we get $\\theta = 5.03 \\times 10^{-4} \\mathrm{~arcsec}$.\nStep 10:  Rounding this to two significant figures, we get $\\theta = 5.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\mathrm{~arcsec}$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the theoretical limiting angular resolution of the telescope is $5.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\mathrm{~arcsec}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5.0 \\times 10^{-4}}",

  "Problem: An extrasolar planet has been observed which passes in front of (i.e., transits) its parent star. If the planet is dark (i.e., contributes essentially no light of its own) and has a surface area that is $2 \\%$ of that of its parent star, find the decrease in magnitude of the system during transits. Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of magnitude and how it relates to the brightness of celestial objects.\nStep 2:  The magnitude of an object is a measure of its brightness, with lower magnitudes indicating brighter objects. The magnitude scale is logarithmic, meaning that a difference of 1 magnitude corresponds to a change in brightness by a factor of $2.512$.\nStep 3:  We are given that the planet has a surface area that is $2 \\%$ of that of its parent star. This means that the planet's surface area is $0.02$ times the surface area of the star.\nStep 4:  Since the planet is dark, it contributes essentially no light of its own, so the total brightness of the system during transit is the brightness of the star minus the brightness of the planet.\nStep 5:  The brightness of the star is proportional to its surface area, so if the planet's surface area is $0.02$ times that of the star, the planet's brightness is $0.02$ times the star's brightness.\nStep 6:  Therefore, the total brightness of the system during transit is $0.98$ times the star's brightness, since $1 - 0.02 = 0.98$.\nStep 7:  To find the decrease in magnitude, we need to find the difference in magnitude between the system during transit and the system without the planet.\nStep 8:  Since the magnitude scale is logarithmic, we can use the formula $m_1 - m_2 = -2.5 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{f_1}{f_2} \\right)$, where $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the magnitudes, and $f_1$ and $f_2$ are the fluxes (brightnesses).\nStep 9:  In this case, $f_1$ is the brightness of the system during transit, which is $0.98$ times the star's brightness, and $f_2$ is the brightness of the system without the planet, which is the star's brightness.\nStep 10:  Plugging in the values, we get $m_1 - m_2 = -2.5 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{0.98}{1} \\right)$.\nStep 11:  Simplifying, we get $m_1 - m_2 = -2.5 \\log_{10} (0.98)$.\nStep 12:  Using a calculator, we find that $\\log_{10} (0.98) \\approx -0.0086$.\nStep 13:  Therefore, $m_1 - m_2 \\approx -2.5 \\times -0.0086 \\approx 0.0215$.\nStep 14:  Rounding to two decimal places, we get $m_1 - m_2 \\approx 0.02$.\nStep 15:  Therefore, the decrease in magnitude of the system during transits is approximately $0.02$ magnitudes.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0.02}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the Sun's energy, its mass, and its radius. The given expression for the total energy of the Sun is $E \\simeq-\\frac{G M^{2}}{R}$, where $M$ and $R$ are the mass and radius of the Sun, respectively.\nStep 2:  We are told that the energy generation in the Sun is suddenly turned off, and it begins to slowly contract. During this contraction, its mass $M$ remains constant, and its surface temperature remains constant at $\\sim 5800 \\mathrm{~K}$. We are also told that the total energy of the Sun is always given by the above expression, even as $R$ gets smaller.\nStep 3:  The problem asks us to find the time (in years) for the Sun to shrink to $1 / 2$ its present radius. To do this, we need to write down a simple differential equation relating the power radiated at the Sun's surface with the change in its total energy.\nStep 4:  The power radiated at the Sun's surface is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the power radiated per unit surface area is proportional to the fourth power of the surface temperature. Since the surface temperature remains constant, the power radiated at the Sun's surface is constant.\nStep 5:  The change in the Sun's total energy is given by the expression $E \\simeq-\\frac{G M^{2}}{R}$. Since the mass $M$ remains constant, the change in the total energy is proportional to the change in the radius $R$.\nStep 6:  We can write a differential equation relating the power radiated at the Sun's surface with the change in its total energy. The power radiated at the Sun's surface is constant, so the rate of change of the total energy is proportional to the power radiated.\nStep 7:  We can integrate this differential equation to find the time for the Sun to shrink to $1 / 2$ its present radius.\nStep 8:  To solve the differential equation, we need to express the power radiated at the Sun's surface in terms of the total energy and the radius. We can use the Stefan-Boltzmann law to express the power radiated per unit surface area in terms of the surface temperature.\nStep 9:  Since the surface temperature remains constant, the power radiated per unit surface area is constant. We can use this to express the total power radiated at the Sun's surface in terms of the surface area.\nStep 10:  The surface area of the Sun is proportional to the square of the radius. Since the radius is changing, the surface area is also changing. We can use this to express the total power radiated at the Sun's surface in terms of the radius.\nStep 11:  We can then use this expression for the total power radiated at the Sun's surface to write a differential equation relating the power radiated with the change in the total energy.\nStep 12:  We can integrate this differential equation to find the time for the Sun to shrink to $1 / 2$ its present radius.\nStep 13:  To integrate the differential equation, we need to use the expression for the total energy in terms of the mass and radius.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to calculate the angular resolution of the Very Large Array (VLA) telescope. The angular resolution is a measure of the minimum angle between two objects that can be resolved by the telescope.\nStep 2:  The formula to calculate the angular resolution is given by $\\theta = \\frac{1.22 \\lambda}{D}$, where $\\theta$ is the angular resolution, $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of observation, and $D$ is the diameter of the telescope.\nStep 3:  We are given that the effective diameter of the VLA telescope is $36 \\mathrm{~km}$ and the typical wavelength used for observation is $6 \\mathrm{~cm}$.\nStep 4:  First, we need to convert the wavelength from centimeters to meters. Since $1 \\mathrm{~m} = 100 \\mathrm{~cm}$, the wavelength in meters is $6 \\mathrm{~cm} = 0.06 \\mathrm{~m}$.\nStep 5:  Next, we need to convert the diameter from kilometers to meters. Since $1 \\mathrm{~km} = 1000 \\mathrm{~m}$, the diameter in meters is $36 \\mathrm{~km} = 36,000 \\mathrm{~m}$.\nStep 6:  Now, we can plug in the values into the formula to calculate the angular resolution. $\\theta = \\frac{1.22 \\times 0.06}{36,000}$\nStep 7:  Simplifying the expression, we get $\\theta = \\frac{0.0732}{36,000}$\nStep 8:  Further simplifying, we get $\\theta = 2.0355556 \\times 10^{-6}$\nStep 9:  To convert this to arcseconds, we multiply by $206265$ (since $1 \\mathrm{~arcsec} = \\frac{1}{206265} \\mathrm{~radians}$). $\\theta = 2.0355556 \\times 10^{-6} \\times 206265$\nStep 10:  Simplifying, we get $\\theta = 0.0042 \\mathrm{~arcsec}$\nStep 11:  Therefore, the estimated angular resolution of the VLA telescope is $0.0042 \\mathrm{~arcsec}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0.0042}$",

  "Problem: Find the distance modulus to the Andromeda galaxy (M31). Take the distance to Andromeda to be $750 \\mathrm{kpc}$, and answer to three significant figures.\nStep 1:  To find the distance modulus to the Andromeda galaxy (M31), we first need to understand what the distance modulus is. The distance modulus is a measure of the distance to a celestial object, typically expressed in terms of its apparent brightness and absolute brightness.\nStep 2:  The formula for the distance modulus is given by $m - M = 5 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{d}{10} \\right)$, where $m$ is the apparent magnitude, $M$ is the absolute magnitude, and $d$ is the distance in parsecs.\nStep 3:  We are given the distance to Andromeda as $750 \\mathrm{kpc}$, which we need to convert to parsecs. Since $1 \\mathrm{kpc} = 1000 \\mathrm{pc}$, the distance in parsecs is $750 \\times 1000 = 750,000 \\mathrm{pc}$.\nStep 4:  Now, we can use the distance modulus formula to find the distance modulus. We need to calculate $5 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{750,000}{10} \\right)$.\nStep 5:  First, we calculate the ratio inside the logarithm: $\\frac{750,000}{10} = 75,000$.\nStep 6:  Then, we take the logarithm base 10 of this ratio: $\\log_{10} (75,000) \\approx 4.875$.\nStep 7:  Finally, we multiply this result by 5 to get the distance modulus: $5 \\times 4.875 \\approx 24.375$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the distance modulus to the Andromeda galaxy (M31) is approximately $24.375$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{24.4}$",
  "Step 1:  To find the angular resolution of the Hubble Space telescope, we can use the Rayleigh criterion, which states that the minimum angle between two point sources that can be resolved is given by $\\theta = 1.22 \\frac{\\lambda}{D}$, where $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of light and $D$ is the diameter of the telescope.\nStep 2:  Given that the effective diameter of the Hubble Space telescope is $2.5 \\mathrm{~m}$ and the typical wavelength used for observation is $0.6 \\mu \\mathrm{m}$, we can substitute these values into the formula to calculate the angular resolution.\nStep 3:  First, we need to convert the wavelength from micrometers to meters. Since $1 \\mu \\mathrm{m} = 10^{-6} \\mathrm{~m}$, the wavelength in meters is $0.6 \\mu \\mathrm{m} = 0.6 \\times 10^{-6} \\mathrm{~m} = 6 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~m}$.\nStep 4:  Now, we can substitute the values into the formula: $\\theta = 1.22 \\frac{6 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~m}}{2.5 \\mathrm{~m}}$.\nStep 5:  Performing the calculation, we get $\\theta = 1.22 \\times 2.4 \\times 10^{-7} = 2.928 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~rad}$.\nStep 6:  To convert this to arcseconds, we use the conversion factor $1 \\mathrm{~rad} = 206265 \\mathrm{~arcsec}$.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the angular resolution in arcseconds is $2.928 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~rad} \\times 206265 \\mathrm{~arcsec/rad} = 0.0603 \\mathrm{~arcsec}$.\nStep 8:  Rounding this to a more reasonable number of significant figures, we get an estimate of $0.06 \\mathrm{~arcsec}$ for the angular resolution of the Hubble Space telescope.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0.06}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to apply Snell's law, which relates the angles of incidence and refraction to the indices of refraction of the two media through which the light passes.\nStep 2:  Snell's law is given by the equation $n_1 \\sin(\\theta_1) = n_2 \\sin(\\theta_2)$, where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the indices of refraction of the first and second media, respectively, and $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$ are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.\nStep 3:  In this case, the light is incident from water into air, so the indices of refraction are $n_1 = 1.3$ for water and $n_2 = 1$ for air.\nStep 4:  The angle of incidence in water is $\\theta_w$, and we need to find the angle of refraction in air, $\\theta_a$.\nStep 5:  Applying Snell's law, we have $1.3 \\sin(\\theta_w) = 1 \\sin(\\theta_a)$.\nStep 6:  To find $\\theta_a$, we need to isolate $\\sin(\\theta_a)$, which gives us $\\sin(\\theta_a) = \\frac{1.3 \\sin(\\theta_w)}{1}$.\nStep 7:  Since $\\sin(\\theta_a) = \\frac{1.3 \\sin(\\theta_w)}{1}$, we can find $\\theta_a$ by taking the inverse sine of both sides, which gives us $\\theta_a = \\sin^{-1} \\left( \\frac{1.3 \\sin(\\theta_w)}{1} \\right)$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the expression for the angle of the light once it emerges from the water into the air, $\\theta_a$, in terms of $\\theta_w$ is $\\theta_a = \\sin^{-1} \\left( \\frac{1.3 \\sin(\\theta_w)}{1} \\right)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\sin^{-1} \\left( \\frac{1.3 \\sin(\\theta_w)}{1} \\right)}",

  "Step 1:  To find the mean free path for collisions among stars, we first need to understand the concept of mean free path. The mean free path is the average distance a particle travels before colliding with another particle.\nStep 2:  We are given the density of stars in a globular star cluster as $10^{6} \\mathrm{pc}^{-3}$, where $\\mathrm{pc}$ stands for parsecs. We need to convert this density to stars per cubic centimeter to calculate the mean free path.\nStep 3:  First, we need to convert the density from stars per cubic parsec to stars per cubic centimeter. We know that $1 \\mathrm{pc} = 3.0857 \\times 10^{18} \\mathrm{cm}$, so we can use this conversion factor to find the density in stars per cubic centimeter.\nStep 4:  The density in stars per cubic centimeter is given by $10^{6} \\mathrm{pc}^{-3} \\times (3.0857 \\times 10^{18} \\mathrm{cm} \\mathrm{pc}^{-1})^{3} = 9.58 \\times 10^{49} \\mathrm{stars} \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$.\nStep 5:  Next, we need to find the average distance between stars. We can use the formula for density, which is $\\rho = \\frac{N}{V}$, where $\\rho$ is the density, $N$ is the number of particles, and $V$ is the volume. Rearranging this formula, we get $V = \\frac{N}{\\rho}$.\nStep 6:  The volume of a single star is given by $V_{\\mathrm{star}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^{3}$, where $r$ is the radius of the star. We are given that the stars have the same radius as the Sun, which is $6.96 \\times 10^{5} \\mathrm{cm}$.\nStep 7:  Substituting the values, we get $V_{\\mathrm{star}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (6.96 \\times 10^{5} \\mathrm{cm})^{3} = 1.41 \\times 10^{27} \\mathrm{cm}^{3}$.\nStep 8:  The volume of a single star is $1.41 \\times 10^{27} \\mathrm{cm}^{3}$, and the density of stars is $9.58 \\times 10^{49} \\mathrm{stars} \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, so the average distance between stars is given by $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{\\rho V_{\\mathrm{star}}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{9.58 \\times 10^{49} \\mathrm{stars} \\mathrm{cm}^{-3} \\times 1.41 \\times 10^{27} \\mathrm{cm}^{3}}} = 1.35 \\times 10^{-8} \\mathrm{cm}$.\nStep 9:  Finally, we can use the formula for mean free path, which is $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2} \\pi n \\sigma^{2}}$, where $n$ is the number density of particles and $\\sigma$ is the cross-sectional area of a particle.\nStep 10:  The number density of particles is given by $n = \\frac{N}{V} = \\frac{9.58 \\times 10^{49} \\mathrm{stars} \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}}{1.41 \\times 10^{27} \\mathrm{cm}^{3}} = 6.79 \\times 10^{22} \\mathrm{stars} \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$.\nStep 11:  The cross-sectional area of a particle is given by $\\sigma = \\pi r^{2} = \\pi (6.96 \\times 10^{5} \\mathrm{cm})^{2} = 1.54 \\times 10^{12} \\mathrm{cm}^{2}$.\nStep 12:  Substituting the values, we get $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2} \\pi (6.79 \\times 10^{22} \\mathrm{stars} \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}) (1.54 \\times 10^{12} \\mathrm{cm}^{2})^{2}} = 1.35 \\times 10^{-8} \\mathrm{cm}$.\nStep 13:  Therefore, the mean free path for collisions among stars is $1.35 \\times 10^{-8} \\mathrm{cm}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1.4 \\times 10^{-8}}",

  "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem describes two tanks, each with a volume of $V$ liters, where a saline solution with concentration $c$ gm/liter is added at a rate of $r$ liters/minute. The solution is mixed and then flows out of the tank at the same rate.

  "Step 1:  To find the value of $A$ such that $A \\sin (3 t)$ is a solution of the differential equation $\\ddot{x}+4 x=\\sin (3 t)$, we need to substitute $A \\sin (3 t)$ into the differential equation and solve for $A$.\nStep 2:  The differential equation is given by $\\ddot{x}+4 x=\\sin (3 t)$. We are looking for a solution of the form $x=A \\sin (3 t)$.\nStep 3:  To find $A$, we need to substitute $x=A \\sin (3 t)$ into the differential equation and solve for $A$.\nStep 4:  First, we need to find the second derivative of $x=A \\sin (3 t)$ with respect to $t$. The first derivative is $\\dot{x}=3 A \\cos (3 t)$, and the second derivative is $\\ddot{x}=-9 A \\sin (3 t)$.\nStep 5:  Now, we substitute $x=A \\sin (3 t)$ and $\\ddot{x}=-9 A \\sin (3 t)$ into the differential equation $\\ddot{x}+4 x=\\sin (3 t)$.\nStep 6:  Substituting, we get $-9 A \\sin (3 t)+4 A \\sin (3 t)=\\sin (3 t)$.\nStep 7:  Simplifying, we get $-5 A \\sin (3 t)=\\sin (3 t)$.\nStep 8:  To solve for $A$, we need to equate the coefficients of $\\sin (3 t)$ on both sides of the equation.\nStep 9:  Equating the coefficients, we get $-5 A=1$.\nStep 10:  Solving for $A$, we get $A=-\\frac{1}{5}$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the value of $A$ such that $A \\sin (3 t)$ is a solution of the differential equation $\\ddot{x}+4 x=\\sin (3 t)$ is $A=-\\frac{1}{5}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-\\frac{1}{5}}$",
  "Step 1: To solve the differential equation $y^{\\prime}=x-2 y$ analytically using integrating factors, we first need to identify the function $p(x)$ in the equation $\\dot{x}+p x=0$. In this case, $p(x)=-2$.\n\nStep 2: The integrating factor $u(t)$ is a function such that $u \\dot{x}+u p x=\\frac{d}{d t}(u x)$. In this case, we need to find $u(x)$ such that $u(x)(x-2 y)+u(x)(-2 y)=\\frac{d}{d x}(u(x) y)$. However, the given equation is $y^{\\prime}=x-2 y$, not $\\dot{x}+p x=0$. So, we need to rearrange the equation to the form $\\dot{x}+p x=0$.\n\nStep 3: Rearranging the equation $y^{\\prime}=x-2 y$ to the form $\\dot{x}+p x=0$, we get $\\dot{y}+2 y=x$. Now, we can identify $p(x)=2$.\n\nStep 4: The integrating factor $u(x)$ is a function such that $u(x) \\dot{y}+u(x) p(x) y=\\frac{d}{d x}(u(x) y)$. In this case, we need to find $u(x)$ such that $u(x) \\dot{y}+u(x)(2 y)=\\frac{d}{d x}(u(x) y)$.\n\nStep 5: The integrating factor $u(x)$ is given by $u(x)=e^{\\int p(x) d x}$. In this case, $p(x)=2$, so $u(x)=e^{\\int 2 d x}=e^{2 x}$.\n\nStep 6: Now, we can multiply both sides of the equation $\\dot{y}+2 y=x$ by the integrating factor $u(x)=e^{2 x}$ to get $e^{2 x} \\dot{y}+e^{2 x}(2 y)=e^{2 x} x$.\n\nStep 7: The left-hand side of the equation $e^{2 x} \\dot{y}+e^{2 x}(2 y)=e^{2 x} x$ is the derivative of $e^{2 x} y$, so we can rewrite the equation as $\\frac{d}{d x}(e^{2 x} y)=e^{2 x} x$.\n\nStep 8: Now, we can integrate both sides of the equation $\\frac{d}{d x}(e^{2 x} y)=e^{2 x} x$ to get $e^{2 x} y=\\int e^{2 x} x d x$.\n\nStep 9: To integrate $e^{2 x} x$, we can use integration by parts. Let $u=x$ and $d v=e^{2 x} d x$. Then, $d u=d x$ and $v=\\frac{1}{2} e^{2 x}$.\n\nStep 10: Using integration by parts, we get $\\int e^{2 x} x d x=\\frac{1}{2} e^{2 x} x-\\frac{1}{2} \\int e^{2 x} d x$.\n\nStep 11: To integrate $e^{2 x}$, we can use the formula $\\int e^{a x} d x=\\frac{1}{a} e^{a x}+C$. In this case, $a=2$, so $\\int e^{2 x} d x=\\frac{1}{2} e^{2 x}+C$.\n\nStep 12: Now, we can substitute the result of the integration $\\int e^{2 x} d x=\\frac{1}{2} e^{2 x}+C$ into the equation $\\int e^{2 x} x d x=\\frac{1}{2} e^{2 x} x-\\frac{1}{2} \\int e^{2 x} d x$ to get $\\int e^{2 x} x d x=\\frac{1}{2} e^{2 x} x-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2} e^{2 x}+C\\right)$.\n\nStep 13: Simplifying the equation $\\int e^{2 x} x d x=\\frac{1}{2} e^{2 x} x-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2} e^{2 x}+C\\right)$, we get $\\int e^{2 x} x d x=\\frac{1}{2} e^{2 x} x-\\frac{1}{4} e^{2 x}-\\frac{1}{2} C$.\n\nStep 14: Now, we can substitute the result of the integration $\\int e^{2 x} x d x=\\frac{1}{2} e^{2 x} x-\\frac{1}{4} e^{2 x}-\\frac{1}{2} C$ into the equation $e^{2 x} y=\\int e^{2 x} x d x$ to get $e^{2 x} y=\\frac{1}{2} e^{2 x} x-\\frac{1}{4} e^{2 x}-\\frac{1}{2} C$.\n\nStep 15: Now, we can divide both sides of the equation $e^{2 x} y=\\frac{1}{2} e^{2 x} x-\\frac{1}{4} e^{2 x}-\\frac{1}{2} C$ by $e^{2 x}$ to get $y=\\frac{1}{2} x-\\frac{1}{4}-\\frac{1}{2} C e^{-2 x}$.\n\nStep 16: Now, we can rewrite the equation $y=\\frac{1}{2} x-\\frac{1}{4}-\\frac{1}{2} C e^{-2 x}$ as $y=\\frac{1}{2} x-\\frac{1}{4}-\\frac{C}{2} e^{-2 x}$.\n\nStep 17: Now, we can rewrite the equation $y=\\frac{1}{2} x-\\frac{1}{4}-\\frac{C}{2} e^{-2 x}$ as $y=\\frac{1}{2} x-\\frac{1}{4}-\\frac{C}{2}

We are given the equation $R \\dot{I}+\\frac{1}{C} I=\\dot{V}$, where $I(t)$ is the current, $V(t)$ is the voltage increase across the voltage source, $R$ is the resistance, and $C$ is the capacitance.\nStep 2:  We are told that the voltage $V$ is constant, $V(t)=V_{0}$, and we need to solve for $I(t)$ with the initial condition $I(0)$.\nStep 3:  To solve this differential equation, we first need to isolate the term involving $\\dot{I}$, which is the derivative of the current with respect to time.\nStep 4:  The equation can be rewritten as $R \\dot{I} = \\dot{V} - \\frac{1}{C} I$.

  "Problem: Preamble: The following subproblems refer to the exponential function $e^{-t / 2} \\cos (3 t)$, which we will assume is a solution of the differential equation $m \\ddot{x}+b \\dot{x}+k x=0$. \n\nWhat is $b$ in terms of $m$? Write $b$ as a constant times a function of $m$. Step 1:  The problem provides a differential equation $m \\ddot{x}+b \\dot{x}+k x=0$ and states that the exponential function $e^{-t / 2} \\cos (3 t)$ is a solution to this equation.\nStep 2:  We are asked to find the value of $b$ in terms of $m$. To do this, we need to use the given solution and the differential equation to derive an expression for $b$ in terms of $m$.\nStep 3:  The given solution is $e^{-t / 2} \\cos (3 t)$. We can find the first and second derivatives of this function with respect to $t$.\nStep 4:  The first derivative of $e^{-t / 2} \\cos (3 t)$ is $\\frac{d}{dt} (e^{-t / 2} \\cos (3 t)) = -\\frac{1}{2} e^{-t / 2} \\cos (3 t) + 3 e^{-t / 2} \\sin (3 t)$.\nStep 5:  The second derivative of $e^{-t / 2} \\cos (3 t)$ is $\\frac{d^2}{dt^2} (e^{-t / 2} \\cos (3 t)) = \\frac{3}{4} e^{-t / 2} \\cos (3 t) - \\frac{9}{4} e^{-t / 2} \\sin (3 t) - 3 e^{-t / 2} \\sin (3 t) - 9 e^{-t / 2} \\cos (3 t)$.\nStep 6:  We can substitute these derivatives into the differential equation $m \\ddot{x}+b \\dot{x}+k x=0$ to get an expression for $b$ in terms of $m$.\nStep 7:  Substituting the derivatives into the differential equation, we get $m \\left( \\frac{3}{4} e^{-t / 2} \\cos (3 t) - \\frac{9}{4} e^{-t / 2} \\sin (3 t) - 3 e^{-t / 2} \\sin (3 t) - 9 e^{-t / 2} \\cos (3 t) \\right) + b \\left( -\\frac{1}{2} e^{-t / 2} \\cos (3 t) + 3 e^{-t / 2} \\sin (3 t) \\right) + k e^{-t / 2} \\cos (3 t) = 0$.\nStep 8:  Simplifying the expression, we get $m \\left( -\\frac{15}{4} e^{-t / 2} \\cos (3 t) - \\frac{15}{4} e^{-t / 2} \\sin (3 t) \\right) + b \\left( -\\frac{1}{2} e^{-t / 2} \\cos (3 t) + 3 e^{-t / 2} \\sin (3 t) \\right) + k e^{-t / 2} \\cos (3 t) = 0$.\nStep 9:  Combining like terms, we get $m \\left( -\\frac{15}{4} e^{-t / 2} \\cos (3 t) - \\frac{15}{4} e^{-t / 2} \\sin (3 t) \\right) + b \\left( -\\frac{1}{2} e^{-t / 2} \\cos (3 t) + 3 e^{-t / 2} \\sin (3 t) \\right) + k e^{-t / 2} \\cos (3 t) = 0$.\nStep 10:  Equating the coefficients of the terms with the same exponentials, we get $m \\left( -\\frac{15}{4} \\right) + b \\left( -\\frac{1}{2} \\right) + k = 0$.\nStep 11:  Solving for $b$, we get $b = \\frac{m \\left( -\\frac{15}{4} \\right) - k}{-\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{-\\frac{15}{4} m - k}{-\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{15}{2} m + 2 k$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, $b$ is equal to $\\frac{15}{2} m + 2 k$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{15}{2} m + 2 k}$",

  "Problem: What is the smallest possible positive $k$ such that all functions $x(t)=A \\cos (\\omega t-\\phi)$---where $\\phi$ is an odd multiple of $k$---satisfy $x(0)=0$? \\\\\n\n## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are given a function $x(t) = A \\cos (\\omega t - \\phi)$, where $\\phi$ is an odd multiple of $k$. We need to find the smallest possible positive $k$ such that all functions satisfy $x(0) = 0$.\n\n## Step 2: Evaluate $x(0)$\nTo find $x(0)$, we substitute $t = 0$ into the function $x(t) = A \\cos (\\omega t - \\phi)$. This gives us $x(0) = A \\cos (-\\phi)$.\n\n## Step 3: Simplify $x(0)$\nSince $\\cos (-\\theta) = \\cos \\theta$, we can simplify $x(0) = A \\cos (-\\phi) = A \\cos \\phi$.\n\n## Step 4: Find the condition for $x(0) = 0$\nFor $x(0) = 0$, we need $A \\cos \\phi = 0$. Since $A$ is a constant, we can divide both sides by $A$ to get $\\cos \\phi = 0$.\n\n## Step 5: Find the values of $\\phi$ that satisfy $\\cos \\phi = 0$\nThe cosine function is zero at odd multiples of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. Therefore, $\\phi$ must be an odd multiple of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\n## Step 6: Express $\\phi$ as an odd multiple of $k$\nSince $\\phi$ is an odd multiple of $k$, we can write $\\phi = (2n + 1)k$, where $n$ is an integer.\n\n## Step 7: Find the smallest possible positive $k$\nWe need to find the smallest possible positive $k$ such that $\\phi = (2n + 1)k$ is an odd multiple of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. This means that $(2n + 1)k = (2m + 1)\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, where $m$ is an integer.\n\n## Step 8: Simplify the equation\nWe can simplify the equation $(2n + 1)k = (2m + 1)\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ to $k = \\frac{(2m + 1)\\frac{\\pi}{2}}{2n + 1}$.\n\n## Step 9: Find the smallest possible positive $k$\nTo find the smallest possible positive $k$, we need to find the smallest possible value of $k$ that satisfies the equation $k = \\frac{(2m + 1)\\frac{\\pi}{2}}{2n + 1}$.\n\n## Step 10: Analyze the equation\nSince $k$ is a positive real number, we need $(2m + 1)\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ to be a positive multiple of $2n + 1$. This means that $(2m + 1)$ must be a multiple of $2n + 1$.\n\n## Step 11: Find the smallest possible positive $k$\nThe smallest possible positive $k$ is obtained when $(2m + 1)$ is the smallest multiple of $2n + 1$ that is greater than 1. This occurs when $m = 0$ and $n = 0$, which gives $k = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}{1} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\n## Step 12: Check if $k = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ satisfies the condition\nSince $k = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$

  "Problem: Solve the equation $x^{2}+2 x-8=0$ by factoring.",
  "The characteristic polynomial of the differential equation \\(\\ddot{x}+b \\dot{x}+x=0\\) is given by \\(p(s) = s^2 + bs + 1\\). For critical damping, the roots of the characteristic polynomial must be real and equal. This occurs when the discriminant of the quadratic equation is zero. The discriminant is given by \\(b^2 - 4ac\\), where \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = b\\), and \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, we have \\(b^2 - 4(1)(1) = 0\\). Solving for \\(b\\), we get \\(b^2 = 4\\), which implies \\(b = \\pm 2\\). Since the coefficient of the derivative term is \\(b\\), which represents the damping coefficient, it must be positive. Therefore, the value of \\(b\\) for critical damping is \\(b = \\boxed{2}\\).",

We can write it as \\(\\frac{1}{(s+a)(s+b)} = \\frac{A}{s+a} + \\frac{B}{s+b}\\).\nStep 3:  To find the values of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), we multiply both sides by the denominator \\((s+a)(s+b)\\) to clear the fractions, giving us \\(1 = A(s+b) + B(s+a)\\).\nStep 4:  We then choose suitable values for \\(s\\) to solve for \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). Setting \\(s = -a\\), we get \\(1 = A(-a+b)\\), which simplifies to \\(A = \\frac{1}{b-a}\\).

  "A tritium nucleus is a nucleus of the isotope of hydrogen that contains two protons and one neutron. The quarks that make up the protons and neutrons in the nucleus are up quarks and down quarks. A proton is composed of two up quarks and one down quark, and a neutron is composed of two down quarks and one up quark. Therefore, a tritium nucleus contains two protons and one neutron. Each proton contains one down quark, and the neutron contains two down quarks. So, the total number of down quarks in a tritium nucleus is 2 (from the protons) + 2 (from the neutron) = 4. Therefore, a tritium nucleus contains 4 down quarks. The final answer is \\boxed{4}",
  "A tritium nucleus is composed of one proton and two neutrons. The proton is composed of two up quarks and one down quark, and the neutron is composed of two down quarks and one up quark. Therefore, the tritium nucleus contains a total of 2 + 1 = 3 up quarks. So the final answer is \\boxed{3}",

  "Step 1:  To find the longest wavelength of light that can eject electrons from a potassium photodiode surface, we need to determine the minimum energy required to remove an electron from the surface.\nStep 2:  The energy needed to remove one mole of electrons from a potassium surface is given as $2.15 \\times 10^{5} J$. Since 1 mole of electrons is equivalent to $6.02 \\times 10^{23}$ electrons, we can calculate the energy required to remove one electron by dividing the given energy by the number of electrons in a mole.\nStep 3:  Therefore, the energy required to remove one electron is $\\frac{2.15 \\times 10^{5} J}{6.02 \\times 10^{23}} = 3.57 \\times 10^{-19} J$.\nStep 4:  The energy of a photon is given by the equation $E = hf$, where $h$ is Planck's constant and $f$ is the frequency of the light. We can rearrange this equation to solve for frequency: $f = \\frac{E}{h}$.\nStep 5:  Substituting the energy required to remove one electron ($3.57 \\times 10^{-19} J$) into the equation, we get $f = \\frac{3.57 \\times 10^{-19} J}{6.626 \\times 10^{-34} J s} = 5.39 \\times 10^{14} Hz$.\nStep 6:  The wavelength of light is related to its frequency by the speed of light equation: $c = \\lambda f$, where $c$ is the speed of light, $\\lambda$ is the wavelength, and $f$ is the frequency. Rearranging this equation to solve for wavelength gives us $\\lambda = \\frac{c}{f}$.\nStep 7:  Substituting the speed of light ($3.00 \\times 10^{8} m/s$) and the frequency ($5.39 \\times 10^{14} Hz$) into the equation, we get $\\lambda = \\frac{3.00 \\times 10^{8} m/s}{5.39 \\times 10^{14} Hz} = 5.56 \\times 10^{-7} m$.\nStep 8:  To convert this wavelength from meters to nanometers, we multiply by $10^{9}$, giving us $\\lambda = 5.56 \\times 10^{-7} m \\times 10^{9} nm/m = 556 nm$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the longest wavelength of light with quanta of sufficient energy to eject electrons from a potassium photodiode surface is $\\boxed{556}$ nm.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{556}$",
  "## Step 1: Convert the wavelength from cm to m\nThe wavelength is given as $6.7102 \\times 10^{-5} cm$. To convert it to meters, we multiply by $10^{-2}$ since $1 cm = 10^{-2} m$. Therefore, $\\lambda = 6.7102 \\times 10^{-5} cm \\times 10^{-2} m/cm = 6.7102 \\times 10^{-7} m$.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the frequency using the formula $v = c / \\lambda$\nThe speed of light is $c = 2.9979 \\times 10^{8} m/s$. The wavelength is $\\lambda = 6.7102 \\times 10^{-7} m$. Therefore, the frequency is $v = c / \\lambda = (2.9979 \\times 10^{8} m/s) / (6.7102 \\times 10^{-7} m) = 4.4677 \\times 10^{14} s^{-1}$.\n\n## Step 3: Convert the frequency to Hz\nThe frequency is already in Hz, so no conversion is needed.\n\n## Step 4: Round the frequency to 4 decimal places\nThe frequency is $4.4677 \\times 10^{14} s^{-1}$. Rounding to 4 decimal places gives $4.4677 \\times 10^{14} s^{-1} = 4.4677 \\times 10^{14} Hz$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the wave number using the formula $\\bar{v} = 1 / \\lambda$\nThe wavelength is $\\lambda = 6.7102 \\times 10^{-7} m$. Therefore, the wave number is $\\bar{v} = 1 / \\lambda = 1 / (6.7102 \\times 10^{-7} m) = 1.4903 \\times 10^{6} m^{-1}$.\n\n## Step 6: Convert the wave number from m^{-1} to cm^{-1}\nSince $1 m = 100 cm$, we have $1 m^{-1} = 100 cm^{-1}$. Therefore, $\\bar{v} = 1.4903 \\times 10^{6} m^{-1} \\times 100 cm/m = 1.4903 \\times 10^{8} cm^{-1}$.\n\n## Step 7: Round the wave number to 4 decimal places\nThe wave number is $1.4903 \\times 10^{8} cm^{-1}$. Rounding to 4 decimal places gives $1.4903 \\times 10^{8} cm^{-1} = 1.4903e8 cm^{-1}$.\n\n## Step 8: Convert the wavelength from m to nm\nSince $1 m = 10^{9} nm$, we have $\\lambda = 6.7102 \\times 10^{-7} m \\times 10^{9} nm/m = 6.7102 \\times 10^{2} nm$.\n\n## Step 9: Round the wavelength to 2 decimal places\nThe wavelength is $6.7102 \\times 10^{2} nm$. Rounding to 2 decimal places gives $6.7102 \\times 10^{2} nm = 671.02 nm$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4.4677}$",

  "The atomic weight of ${He}^{++}$ is determined by the atomic weights of its constituents, which are protons and electrons. However, since ${He}^{++}$ has lost two electrons, we only consider the protons. The atomic weight of a proton is 1.007276 amu. Since ${He}^{++}$ has two protons, we multiply the atomic weight of a proton by 2. Therefore, the atomic weight of ${He}^{++}$ is 2.014552 amu. Rounding to 5 decimal places, the atomic weight of ${He}^{++}$ is 2.01455 amu. So the final answer is \\boxed{2.01455}",

  "Step 1:  The problem states that the material appears red in transmitted light, which implies that it absorbs light in the red region of the visible spectrum.\nStep 2:  The visible spectrum ranges from approximately 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red).

The energy of the photon is transferred to the electron, so the final energy of the electron is the sum of the initial energy and the energy of the photon.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the final energy of the electron is $E_f = E_1 + E_{photon} = -2.18 \\times 10^{-18} {~J} + 4.65 \\times 10^{-19} {~J} = -1.51 \\times 10^{-18} {~J}$.\nStep 12:  Now, we need to find the velocity of the electron after the interaction.

  "The balanced equation for the reaction between CO and O2 to form CO2 is 2CO + O2 \u2192 2CO2. The molar mass of CO is 28.01 g/mol, and the molar mass of O2 is 32.00 g/mol. The molar mass of CO2 is 44.01 g/mol. The balanced equation shows that 2 moles of CO react with 1 mole of O2 to form 2 moles of CO2. Therefore, the coefficient of CO is 2, and the coefficient of O2 is 1. The coefficient of CO2 is 2. To find the amount of CO consumed, we need to find the number of moles of CO that reacted. We can do this by finding the number of moles of O2 that reacted and then using the balanced equation to find the number of moles of CO that reacted. The number of moles of O2 that reacted is given by the mass of O2 that reacted divided by the molar mass of O2. The mass of O2 that reacted is 32.0 g, and the molar mass of O2 is 32.00 g/mol. Therefore, the number of moles of O2 that reacted is 32.0 g / 32.00 g/mol = 1 mol. Since the balanced equation shows that 1 mole of O2 reacts with 2 moles of CO, the number of moles of CO that reacted is 2 mol. Therefore, the amount of CO consumed is 2 mol x 28.01 g/mol = 56.02 g. To 1 decimal place, the amount of CO consumed is 56.0 g. Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{56.0}.",

  "Step 1:  The problem involves finding the upper quantum state $\\left({n}_{{i}}\\right)$ involved in an electron transition associated with a specific line of the Lyman series of the hydrogen spectrum.\nStep 2:  The Lyman series corresponds to transitions from higher energy levels to the ground state (n=1). The wavelength of the line is given as $9.50 \\times 10^{-8} {~m}$.\nStep 3:  To find the upper quantum state, we can use the Rydberg formula, which relates the wavelength of the spectral line to the energy levels involved in the transition.\nStep 4:  The Rydberg formula is given by $\\frac{1}{\\lambda} = R \\left( \\frac{1}{n_{f}^{2}} - \\frac{1}{n_{i}^{2}} \\right)$, where $\\lambda$ is the wavelength, $R$ is the Rydberg constant, $n_{f}$ is the final energy level, and $n_{i}$ is the initial energy level.\nStep 5:  In this case, the final energy level is the ground state, $n_{f} = 1$. We need to find the initial energy level, $n_{i}$.\nStep 6:  Rearranging the Rydberg formula to solve for $n_{i}$, we get $\\frac{1}{n_{i}^{2}} = \\frac{1}{n_{f}^{2}} - \\frac{1}{\\lambda R}$.\nStep 7:  Plugging in the given values, we have $\\frac{1}{n_{i}^{2}} = \\frac{1}{1^{2}} - \\frac{1}{\\left(9.50 \\times 10^{-8} {~m}\\right) \\left(1.097 \\times 10^{7} {~m}^{-1}\\right)}$.\nStep 8:  Simplifying, we get $\\frac{1}{n_{i}^{2}} = 1 - \\frac{1}{9.50 \\times 10^{-8} {~m} \\times 1.097 \\times 10^{7} {~m}^{-1}}$.\nStep 9:  Evaluating the expression, we find $\\frac{1}{n_{i}^{2}} = 1 -

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the plane and the direction in a crystal structure. The (111) plane in an FCC (Face-Centered Cubic) structure is a specific plane that can be described by its Miller indices (hkl). The [110]-type directions are a set of directions that can be described by their Miller indices (hk\u2113).\nStep 2:  First, let's recall how to determine if a direction lies in a plane. A direction (hk\u2113) lies in a plane (hkl) if the dot product of the direction vector and the plane normal vector is zero. The plane normal vector is given by the Miller indices (hkl) as (h, k, \u2113). The direction vector is given by the Miller indices (hk\u2113) as (h, k, \u2113).\nStep 3:  The dot product of two vectors (a, b, c) and (d, e, f) is given by a*d + b*e + c*f. If the dot product is zero, the vectors are perpendicular, and the direction lies in the plane.\nStep 4:  For the (111) plane, the plane normal vector is (1, 1, 1). For the [110]-type directions, the direction vectors are (1, 1, 0), (1, 0, 1), and (0, 1, 1).\nStep 5:  We need to calculate the dot product of each direction vector with the plane normal vector (1, 1, 1) to check if they lie in the plane.\nStep 6:  For the direction (1, 1, 0), the dot product is 1*1 + 1*1 + 0*1 = 2. This is not zero, so the direction (1, 1, 0) does not lie in the plane.\nStep 7:  For the direction (1, 0, 1), the dot product is 1*1 + 0*1 + 1*1 = 2. This is not zero, so the direction (1, 0, 1) does not lie in the plane.\nStep 8:  For the direction (0, 1, 1), the dot product is 0*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 = 2. This is not zero, so the direction (0, 1, 1) does not lie in the plane.\nStep 9:  However, we need to consider the symmetry of the FCC structure. The [110]-type directions are equivalent to the [110], [101], and [011] directions.

The energy imparted to an electron by an accelerating potential of one Volt is given as $1.6 \\times 10^{-19}$ Joules.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the energy imparted to the electron\nThe energy imparted to the electron is given by the product of the accelerating potential and the energy imparted by one Volt. Therefore, the energy imparted to the electron is $150 \\times 1.6 \\times 10^{-19}$ Joules.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the energy imparted to the electron in Joules\nThe energy imparted to the electron is $150 \\times 1.6 \\times 10^{-19} = 2.4 \\times 10^{-17}$ Joules.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the velocity of the electron\nThe kinetic energy of the electron is given by $\\frac{1}{2}mv^2$, where $m$ is the mass of the electron and $v$ is its velocity. The energy imparted to the electron is equal to its kinetic energy. Therefore, $\\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = 2.4 \\times 10^{-17}$ Joules.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the velocity of the electron\nThe mass of an electron is $9.11 \\times 10^{-31}$ kg. Therefore, $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 9.11 \\times 10^{-31} \\times v^2 = 2.4 \\times 10^{-17}$ Joules.\n\n## Step 6: Solve for velocity\n$v^2 = \\frac{2 \\times 2.4 \\times 10^{-17}}{9.11 \\times 10^{-31}} = 5.29 \\times 10^{12}$.\n\n## Step 7: Take the square root of both sides\n$v = \\sqrt{5.29 \\times 10^{12}} = 2.30 \\times 10^{6}$ m/s.\n\n## Step 8: Express the answer in the required format\nThe velocity of the electron is $2.30 \\times 10^{6}$ m/s.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2.30 \\times 10^{6}}",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to use Bragg's Law, which relates the wavelength of the radiation, the interplanar spacing of the crystal lattice, and the angle of diffraction.\nStep 2:  First, we need to identify the given information: the radiation used is tungsten (W) $L_{\\alpha}$, and the specimen is thorium (Th). We also need to know the wavelength of the $L_{\\alpha}$ radiation, which is typically around 0.071 nm for tungsten.\nStep 3:  The interplanar spacing, $d$, for the $4^{\\text {th }}$ reflection of thorium can be found using the formula $d = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2}}$, where $a$ is the lattice parameter, and $h, k, l$ are the Miller indices of the plane. For thorium, the lattice parameter is 5.84 \u00c5, and the Miller indices for the $4^{\\text {th }}$ reflection are (4, 0, 0).\nStep 4:  We can calculate the interplanar spacing using the formula: $d = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2}} = \\frac{5.84 \\text{ \u00c5}}{\\sqrt{4^2 + 0^2 + 0^2}} = \\frac{5.84 \\text{ \u00c5}}{4} = 1.46 \\text{ \u00c5} = 1.46 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m}$.\nStep 5:  Now, we can use Bragg's Law to find the angle of diffraction: $2d \\sin \\theta = \\lambda$, where $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of the radiation.\nStep 6:  Rearranging the equation to solve for $\\theta$, we get: $\\sin \\theta = \\frac{\\lambda}{2d}$.\nStep 7:  Plugging in the values, we get: $\\sin \\theta = \\frac{0.071 \\text{ nm}}{2 \\times 1.46 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m}} = \\frac{0.071 \\text{ nm}}{2.92 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m}} = 0.0243$.\nStep 8:  Taking the inverse sine of both sides, we get: $\\theta = \\sin^{-1}(0.0243) = 1.39^{\\circ}$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the angle of the $4^{\\text {th }}$ reflection is $1.39^{\\circ}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1.39}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given information and what is being asked. The metal has a Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) structure, a lattice constant of $3.31 \\AA$, and a density of $16.6 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{cm}^{3}$. We are tasked with determining the atomic weight of this element in g/mole, rounded to 1 decimal place.\nStep 2:  The first step is to calculate the volume of the unit cell. The lattice constant is given as $3.31 \\AA$, which is equivalent to $3.31 \\times 10^{-10} \\mathrm{~m}$. Since the BCC structure has a lattice constant of $a$, the volume of the unit cell is given by $V = a^3$.\nStep 3:  Substituting the given lattice constant, we get $V = (3.31 \\times 10^{-10} \\mathrm{~m})^3 = 3.31 \\times 10^{-30} \\mathrm{~m}^3$.\nStep 4:  Next, we need to calculate the mass of the unit cell. The density of the metal is given as $16.6 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{cm}^{3}$, which is equivalent to $16.6 \\times 10^3 \\mathrm{~kg} / \\mathrm{m}^3$. The mass of the unit cell is given by $m = \\rho V$, where $\\rho$ is the density and $V$ is the volume of the unit cell.\nStep 5:  Substituting the given density and volume, we get $m = (16.6 \\times 10^3 \\mathrm{~kg} / \\mathrm{m}^3) \\times (3.31 \\times 10^{-30} \\mathrm{~m}^3) = 5.49 \\times 10^{-26} \\mathrm{~kg}$.\nStep 6:  Since the BCC structure has 2 atoms per unit cell, the mass of the unit cell is $m = 2 \\times 5.49 \\times 10^{-26} \\mathrm{~kg} = 1.098 \\times 10^{-25} \\mathrm{~kg}$.\nStep 7:  To find the atomic weight, we need to divide the mass of the unit cell by Avogadro's number ($6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\mathrm{~atoms} / \\mathrm{mol}$).\nStep 8:  Therefore, the atomic weight is given by $A = \\frac{m}{N_A} = \\frac{1.098 \\times 10^{-25} \\mathrm{~kg}}{6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\mathrm{~atoms} / \\mathrm{mol}} = 1.82 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~kg} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\nStep 9:  However, we need to convert this to g/mole, so we multiply by $10^3$ to get $A = 1.82 \\times 10^{-4} \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\nStep 10:  Rounding to 1 decimal place, the atomic weight is $A = 1.8 \\times 10^{-4} \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1.8 \\times 10^{-4}}",

Please format your answer as $n \\times 10^x$ where $n$ is to 2 decimal places. Step 1:  To find the radius of an iron atom in a BCC unit cell, we first need to understand the relationship between the radius of the atom and the lattice parameter (a) of the unit cell.\nStep 2:  In a BCC (Body-Centered Cubic) unit cell, the relationship between the radius of the atom (r) and the lattice parameter (a) is given by the equation: $a = \\frac{4r}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\nStep 3:  We are given the density of iron as $\\rho = 7.86 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ and the mass of a single iron atom as $m = 55.85 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\nStep 4:  The volume of the unit cell (V) can be calculated using the formula: $V = \\frac{a^3}{\\sqrt{2}}$ for a BCC unit cell.\nStep 5:  We can also express the volume of the unit cell in terms of the density and mass of the iron atom: $V = \\frac{m}{\\rho}$.\nStep 6:  Equating the two expressions for volume, we can solve for the lattice parameter (a) in terms of the radius of the iron atom (r).\nStep 7:  Once we have the lattice parameter (a), we can use the equation $a = \\frac{4r}{\\sqrt{3}}$ to solve for the radius of the iron atom (r).\nStep 8:  Finally, we can express the radius in the required format as $n \\times 10^x$ where $n$ is to 2 decimal places.\n\nStep 9:  First, let's calculate the volume of the unit cell using the density and mass of the iron atom: $V = \\frac{m}{\\rho} = \\frac{55.85 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}}{7.86 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{cm}^{3}} = 7.10 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\nStep 10:  Since the unit cell contains 2 atoms (one at the center and 8 at the corners), the volume of the unit cell is: $V = \\frac{7.10 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3} / \\mathrm{mol}}{2} = 3.55 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\nStep 11:  Now, we can equate the two expressions for volume: $\\frac{a^3}{\\sqrt{2}} = 3.55 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\nStep 12:  Solving for the lattice parameter (a), we get: $a = \\left(\\frac{3.55 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3} / \\mathrm{mol} \\times \\sqrt{2}}{1}\\right)^{1/3} = 2.87 \\mathrm{~cm}$.\nStep 13:  Now, we can use the equation $a = \\frac{4r}{\\sqrt{3}}$ to solve for the radius of the iron atom (r): $r = \\frac{a \\times \\sqrt{3}}{4} = \\frac{2.87 \\mathrm{~cm} \\times \\sqrt{3}}{4} = 1.24 \\mathrm{~cm}$.\nStep 14:  Finally, we can express the radius in the required format as $n \\times 10^x$ where $n$ is to 2 decimal places: $1.24 \\mathrm{~cm} = 1.24 \\times 10^0 \\mathrm{~cm}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1.24 \\times 10^0}$",

  "Problem: Determine the wavelength of $\\lambda_{K_{\\alpha}}$ for molybdenum (Mo). Please format your answer as $n \\times 10^x$ where $n$ is to 2 decimal places, in meters.\nStep 1: Identify the atomic number of molybdenum (Mo) to determine the energy level involved in the K-alpha transition.\nMolybdenum has an atomic number of 42, which means it has 42 electrons. The K-alpha transition involves the transition of an electron from the L shell (2nd energy level) to the K shell (1st energy level).\n\nStep 2: Determine the energy difference between the L shell and the K shell for molybdenum.\nThe energy difference between the L shell and the K shell can be calculated using the formula:\n\\[ \\Delta E = E_{L} - E_{K} \\]\nwhere $E_{L}$ is the energy of the L shell and $E_{K}$ is the energy of the K shell.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the energy of the L shell and the K shell for molybdenum.\nThe energy of the L shell and the K shell can be calculated using the following formulas:\n\\[ E_{L} = -\\frac{Z^2}{n^2} \\times 13.6 \\, \\text{eV} \\]\n\\[ E_{K} = -\\frac{Z^2}{1^2} \\times 13.6 \\, \\text{eV} \\]\nwhere $Z$ is the atomic number and $n$ is the principal quantum number.\n\nStep 4: Substitute the values of $Z$ and $n$ into the formulas to calculate the energy of the L shell and the K shell.\nFor molybdenum, $Z = 42$ and $n = 2$ for the L shell, and $n = 1$ for the K shell.\n\\[ E_{L} = -\\frac{42^2}{2^2} \\times 13.6 \\, \\text{eV} = -\\frac{1764}{4} \\times 13.6 \\, \\text{eV} = -\\frac{23736}{4} \\, \\text{eV} = -5924 \\, \\text{eV} \\]\n\\[ E_{K} = -\\frac{42^2}{1^2} \\times 13.6 \\, \\text{eV} = -\\frac{1764}{1} \\times 13.6 \\, \\text{eV} = -23736 \\, \\text{eV} \\]\n\nStep 5: Calculate the energy difference between the L shell and the K shell.\n\\[ \\Delta E = E_{L} - E_{K} = -5924 \\, \\text{eV} - (-23736 \\, \\text{eV}) = -5924 + 23736 \\, \\text{eV} = 17812 \\, \\text{eV} \\]\n\nStep 6: Convert the energy difference from eV to Joules.\n\\[ \\Delta E = 17812 \\, \\text{eV} \\times 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J/eV} = 2.854 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{J} \\]\n\nStep 7: Calculate the wavelength of the K-alpha transition using the formula:\n\\[ \\lambda = \\frac{hc}{\\Delta E} \\]\nwhere $h$ is the Planck constant, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\\Delta E$ is the energy difference.\n\nStep 8: Substitute the values of $h$, $c$, and $\\Delta E$ into the formula to calculate the wavelength.\n\\[ \\lambda = \\frac{6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J s} \\times 3.00 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s}}{2.854 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{J}} = \\frac{19.878 \\times 10^{-26} \\, \\text{J m}}{2.854 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{J}} = 6.96 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6.96 \\times 10^{-11}}",
  "Step 1:  To find the second-nearest neighbor distance for nickel (Ni) at $100^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, we first need to understand the given information and what is being asked. The density of nickel at $100^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ is given as $8.83 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{cm}^{3}$.\nStep 2:  The second-nearest neighbor distance in a crystal lattice is related to the lattice parameters and the coordination number. However, without specific information about the crystal structure of nickel at $100^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, we can't directly calculate the second-nearest neighbor distance using the given density.\nStep 3:  However, we can use the given density to find the lattice parameter of nickel, which is a common approach in solid-state physics. The lattice parameter can be related to the density through the formula: $\\rho = \\frac{Z \\cdot M}{N_A \\cdot a^3}$, where $\\rho$ is the density, $Z$ is the number of atoms per unit cell, $M$ is the atomic mass, $N_A$ is Avogadro's number, and $a$ is the lattice parameter.\nStep 4:  Rearranging the formula to solve for $a$, we get: $a = \\left( \\frac{Z \\cdot M}{N_A \\cdot \\rho} \\right)^{1/3}$.\nStep 5:  For nickel, $Z = 4$ (face-centered cubic structure), $M = 58.6934 \\mathrm{~g/mol}$, $N_A = 6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$, and $\\rho = 8.83 \\mathrm{~g/cm}^3$.\nStep 6:  Substituting these values into the formula, we get: $a = \\left( \\frac{4 \\cdot 58.6934 \\mathrm{~g/mol}}{6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\mathrm{mol}^{-1} \\cdot 8.83 \\mathrm{~g/cm}^3} \\right)^{1/3}$.\nStep 7:  Calculating this, we find: $a = \\left( \\frac{4 \\cdot 58.6934}{6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\cdot 8.83} \\right)^{1/3} = \\left( \\frac{234.7736}{5.310 \\times 10^{24}} \\right)^{1/3} = \\left( 4.404 \\times 10^{-22} \\right)^{1/3} = 3.52 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{cm}$.\nStep 8:  Converting this to pm, we get: $a = 3.52 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{cm} \\times 10^{10} \\mathrm{pm/cm} = 3.52 \\times 10^{3} \\mathrm{pm}$.\nStep 9:  However, this is the lattice parameter, not the second-nearest neighbor distance. To find the second-nearest neighbor distance, we need to know the crystal structure and the coordination number, which is not provided.\nStep 10:  Without this information, we cannot accurately calculate the second-nearest neighbor distance. Therefore, we cannot provide a numerical answer to this problem.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",
  "The working temperature for silica glass is typically around 1000\u00b0C. This is the temperature at which silica glass can withstand significant thermal stress without degrading or breaking. However, it's worth noting that the exact working temperature can vary depending on the specific application and the quality of the glass. In general, silica glass is used in high-temperature applications such as furnace windows, kiln furniture, and laboratory equipment. It's also used in optical components such as lenses and prisms, where its high thermal stability is beneficial. In these applications, the working temperature of silica glass is often in the range of 500\u00b0C to 1000\u00b0C. \n\n\\boxed{1000}",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of electron diffraction and the Bragg's law, which relates the wavelength of the electrons to the interplanar spacing of the crystal lattice.\nStep 2:  First, we need to find the interplanar spacing of the $\\{220\\}$ planes of gold. The interplanar spacing can be calculated using the formula $d_{hkl} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2}}$, where $a$ is the lattice parameter and $h, k, l$ are the Miller indices of the plane.\nStep 3:  The lattice parameter $a$ for gold is $4.078 \\times 10^{-10} \\, \\mathrm{m}$. The Miller indices for the $\\{220\\}$ plane are $h = 2, k = 2, l = 0$.\nStep 4:  Substituting these values into the formula, we get $d_{220} = \\frac{4.078 \\times 10^{-10} \\, \\mathrm{m}}{\\sqrt{2^2 + 2^2 + 0^2}} = \\frac{4.078 \\times 10^{-10} \\, \\mathrm{m}}{\\sqrt{8}} = \\frac{4.078 \\times 10^{-10} \\, \\mathrm{m}}{2.828} = 1.439 \\times 10^{-10} \\, \\mathrm{m}$.\nStep 5:  Next, we need to find the wavelength of the electrons. The wavelength of electrons can be calculated using the de Broglie equation, $\\lambda = \\frac{h}{p}$, where $h$ is the Planck constant and $p$ is the momentum of the electron.\nStep 6:  The momentum of the electron can be calculated using the formula $p = \\sqrt{2mE}$, where $m$ is the mass of the electron and $E$ is the kinetic energy of the electron.\nStep 7:  However, we are given the potential $V$ that must be applied to the electrons, so we can use the formula $E = eV$, where $e$ is the elementary charge.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the kinetic energy of the electron is $E = eV$, and the momentum is $p = \\sqrt{2mE} = \\sqrt{2meV}$.\nStep 9:  Substituting these values into the de Broglie equation, we get $\\lambda = \\frac{h}{p} = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{2meV}}$.\nStep 10:  Now, we can use Bragg's law, $2d \\sin \\theta = n \\lambda$, where $d$ is the interplanar spacing, $\\theta$ is the angle of diffraction, $n$ is an integer, and $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of the electrons.\nStep 11:  Substituting the values, we get $2 \\times 1.439 \\times 10^{-10} \\, \\mathrm{m} \\sin 5^{\\circ} = n \\times \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{2meV}}$.\nStep 12:  Solving for $V$, we get $V = \\frac{h^2}{2me^2} \\left( \\frac{2d \\sin \\theta}{n} \\right)^2$.\nStep 13:  Substituting the values, we get $V = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\mathrm{J} \\, \\mathrm{s})^2}{2 \\times 9.109 \\times 10^{-31} \\, \\mathrm{kg} \\times (1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\mathrm{C})^2} \\left( \\frac{2 \\times 1.439 \\times 10^{-10} \\, \\mathrm{m} \\sin 5^{\\circ}}{1} \\right)^2$.\nStep 14:  Simplifying, we get $V = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\mathrm{J} \\, \\mathrm{s})^2}{2 \\times 9.109 \\times 10^{-31} \\, \\mathrm{kg} \\times (1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\mathrm{C})^2} \\left( \\frac{2 \\times 1.439 \\times 10^{-10} \\, \\mathrm{m} \\times 0.0873}{1} \\right)^2$.\nStep 15:  Evaluating, we get $V = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\mathrm{J} \\, \\mathrm{s})^2}{2 \\times 9.109 \\times 10^{-31} \\, \\mathrm{kg} \\times (1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\mathrm{C})^2} \\left( 2.52 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\mathrm{m} \\right)^2$.\nStep 16:  Simplifying, we get $V =

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of diffusion and the equation that describes the concentration of a diffusing species as a function of time and depth.\nStep 2:  The equation we will use is the solution to Fick's second law of diffusion, which describes the concentration profile of a diffusing species in a semi-infinite solid. The equation is given by: $C(x, t) = C_{s} \\text{erfc}\\left(\\frac{x}{2\\sqrt{Dt}}\\right)$, where $C(x, t)$ is the concentration at depth $x$ and time $t$, $C_{s}$ is the surface concentration, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, and $\\text{erfc}$ is the complementary error function.\nStep 3:  However, in this problem, we are given that the surface concentration of chromium remains constant at $100 \\%$, which means $C_{s} = 1$. We are also given that the concentration of chromium at a depth of $0.002 \\mathrm{~cm}$ is $1.8 \\%$, which means $C(0.002, t) = 0.018$.\nStep 4:  We need to find the time $t$ it takes to achieve this concentration at the given depth.\nStep 5:  We can rearrange the equation to solve for $t$: $t = \\frac{x^{2}}{4D} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\text{erfc}^{-1}\\left(1-\\frac{C(x, t)}{C_{s}}\\right)}\\right)^{2}$.\nStep 6:  We can plug in the given values: $x = 0.002 \\mathrm{~cm}$, $C(x, t) = 0.018$, $C_{s} = 1$, and $D = 0.54 \\mathrm{~cm}^{2} / \\mathrm{s}$.\nStep 7:  We can also use the given activation energy $E_{A} = 286 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$ to calculate the diffusion coefficient $D$ using the Arrhenius equation: $D = D_{o} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{A}}{RT}\\right)$, where $D_{o}$ is the pre-exponential factor, $R$ is the gas constant, and $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.\nStep 8:  We can calculate $D$ using the given values: $D_{o} = 0.54 \\mathrm{~cm}^{2} / \\mathrm{s}$, $E_{A} = 286 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$, $R = 8.314 \\mathrm{~J} / \\mathrm{mol} \\cdot \\mathrm{K}$, and $T = 1273 \\mathrm{~K}$.\nStep 9:  We can then plug in the calculated value of $D$ into the equation for $t$ and solve for $t$.\nStep 10:  Finally, we can round the answer to 1 decimal place.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1.2}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to calculate the vacancy fraction in copper at a given temperature. The vacancy fraction is given by the formula: $n_{\\mathrm{V}}=N_{\\mathrm{C}} \\exp \\left(-\\frac{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{V}}}{k T}+\\frac{\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{V}}}{k}\\right)$ where $n_{\\mathrm{V}}$ is the vacancy fraction, $N_{\\mathrm{C}}$ is the number of available sites, $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{V}}$ is the enthalpy of vacancy formation, $k$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin, and $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{V}}$ is the entropy of vacancy formation.\nStep 2:  We are given the values of $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{V}}=1.03 \\mathrm{eV}$ and $A=1.1$. We need to convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin: $T=20^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}+273.15=293.15 \\mathrm{~K}$.\nStep 3:  We also need to calculate the number of available sites, $N_{\\mathrm{C}}$. The number of available sites is given by the formula: $N_{\\mathrm{C}}=N_{\\mathrm{A}} \\exp \\left(-\\frac{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{V}}}{k T}+\\frac{\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{V}}}{k}\\right)$ where $N_{\\mathrm{A}}$ is the number of atoms in the crystal.\nStep 4:  We are given the value of $A=1.1$.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the concept of planar packing fraction and how it relates to the (110) plane of aluminum.\nStep 2:  The planar packing fraction is the ratio of the area occupied by atoms in a given plane to the total area of the plane. In the context of crystal structures, this can be calculated using the atomic radius and the lattice parameters of the crystal.\nStep 3:  For aluminum, we are given that the temperature is $300 \\mathrm{~K}$, but this information is not directly relevant to calculating the planar packing fraction of the (110) plane.\nStep 4:  The (110) plane of a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice, which is the crystal structure of aluminum, has a specific arrangement of atoms. In this plane, the atoms are arranged in a hexagonal pattern, with each atom surrounded by six nearest neighbors.\nStep 5:  To calculate the planar packing fraction, we need to determine the area of the (110) plane and the area occupied by the atoms in that plane.\nStep 6:  The area of the (110) plane can be calculated using the lattice parameters of the FCC lattice. The lattice parameter (a) of aluminum is given as $4.05 \\mathrm{~\\AA}$.\nStep 7:  The area of the (110) plane can be calculated using the formula: $A = \\frac{a^2}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\nStep 8:  The area occupied by the atoms in the (110) plane can be calculated using the atomic radius (r) of aluminum. The atomic radius of aluminum is given as $1.43 \\mathrm{~\\AA}$.\nStep 9:  The area occupied by the atoms in the (110) plane can be calculated using the formula: $A_{atoms} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}r^2}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\nStep 10:  The planar packing fraction can then be calculated by dividing the area occupied by the atoms by the total area of the (110) plane.\nStep 11:  The planar packing fraction is given by the formula: $\\frac{A_{atoms}}{A} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}r^2}{\\sqrt{2}a^2}$.\nStep 12:  Now, we can substitute the given values for the lattice parameter (a) and atomic radius (r) into the formula to calculate the planar packing fraction.\nStep 13:  Substituting $a = 4.05 \\mathrm{~\\AA}$ and $r = 1.43 \\mathrm{~\\AA}$ into the formula, we get: $\\frac{A_{atoms}}{A} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}(1.43)^2}{\\sqrt{2}(4.05)^2}$.\nStep 14:  Evaluating the expression, we get: $\\frac{A_{atoms}}{A} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}(2.0409)}{\\sqrt{2}(16.4205)}$.\nStep 15:  Simplifying the expression, we get: $\\frac{A_{atoms}}{A} = \\frac{4.0818}{11.5925}$.\nStep 16:  Evaluating the expression, we get: $\\frac{A_{atoms}}{A} = 0.351$.\nStep 17:  Therefore, the planar packing fraction of the (110) plane of aluminum is approximately $0.351$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0.351}$",
  "Step 1:  To find the inter-ionic equilibrium distance in meters between the sodium and chlorine ions in a sodium chloride molecule, we need to use the given bond energy and repulsive exponent to calculate the distance.\nStep 2:  The bond energy is given as $3.84 \\mathrm{eV}$, and the repulsive exponent is 8. We can use the formula for the inter-ionic equilibrium distance, which is given by $r_e = \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{e^2}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{Z_1 Z_2}{E} \\right)^{1/(n-1)}$, where $e$ is the elementary charge, $\\epsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity, $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ are the atomic numbers of the ions, $E$ is the bond energy, and $n$ is the repulsive exponent.\nStep 3:  First, we need to convert the bond energy from eV to Joules. We know that $1 \\mathrm{eV} = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{J}$, so the bond energy in Joules is $3.84 \\mathrm{eV} \\times 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{J/eV} = 6.16 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{J}$.\nStep 4:  Next, we need to calculate the product of the elementary charge and the atomic numbers of the ions, which is $e \\times Z_1 \\times Z_2 = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C} \\times 11 \\times 17 = 2.73 \\times 10^{-18} \\mathrm{C}$.\nStep 5:  Now, we can plug in the values into the formula for the inter-ionic equilibrium distance: $r_e = \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{(1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C})^2}{4 \\pi \\times 8.85 \\times 10^{-12} \\mathrm{F/m}} \\frac{11 \\times 17}{6.16 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{J}} \\right)^{1/(8-1)}$.\nStep 6:  Simplifying the expression, we get $r_e = \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{(1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C})^2}{4 \\pi \\times 8.85 \\times 10^{-12} \\mathrm{F/m}} \\frac{11 \\times 17}{6.16 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{J}} \\right)^{1/7}$.\nStep 7:  Evaluating the expression, we get $r_e = \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{(1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C})^2}{4 \\pi \\times 8.85 \\times 10^{-12} \\mathrm{F/m}} \\frac{11 \\times 17}{6.16 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{J}} \\right)^{1/7} = 2.82 \\times 10^{-10} \\mathrm{m}$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the inter-ionic equilibrium distance in meters between the sodium and chlorine ions in a sodium chloride molecule is $2.8 \\times 10^{-10} \\mathrm{m}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2.8 \\times 10^{-10}}",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the formation energy of vacancies, the temperature, and the concentration of vacancies in a metal.\nStep 2:  The formation energy of a vacancy is given as $2.0 \\mathrm{eV}$, and at $800^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, there is one vacancy for every 10,000 atoms. We are asked to find the temperature at which there will be one vacancy for every 1,000 atoms.\nStep 3:  The concentration of vacancies is related to the formation energy and temperature through the Arrhenius equation, which is given by $c = c_{0} \\exp \\left( -\\frac{E_{f}}{kT} \\right)$, where $c$ is the concentration of vacancies, $c_{0}$ is a constant, $E_{f}$ is the formation energy, $k$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.\nStep 4:  We are given that at $800^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, there is one vacancy for every 10,000 atoms, which means the concentration of vacancies is $10^{-4}$. We need to find the temperature at which the concentration of vacancies is $10^{-3}$, which is one vacancy for every 1,000 atoms.\nStep 5:  We can use the Arrhenius equation to relate the concentration of vacancies at two different temperatures. By taking the ratio of the concentrations at two different temperatures, we can eliminate the constant $c_{0}$ and solve for the temperature.\nStep 6:  The ratio of the concentrations is given by $\\frac{c_{2}}{c_{1}} = \\exp \\left( -\\frac{E_{f}}{k} \\left( \\frac{1}{T_{2}} - \\frac{1}{T_{1}} \\right) \\right)$, where $c_{2}$ and $c_{1}$ are the concentrations at temperatures $T_{2}$ and $T_{1}$, respectively.\nStep 7:  We can rearrange this equation to solve for $T_{2}$, which gives us $T_{2} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{T_{1}} - \\frac{k}{E_{f}} \\ln \\left( \\frac{c_{2}}{c_{1}} \\right)}$.\nStep 8:  We are given that $c_{1} = 10^{-4}$, $c_{2} = 10^{-3}$, $E_{f} = 2.0 \\mathrm{eV}$, and $T_{1} = 800^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C} = 1073 \\mathrm{K}$.\nStep 9:  We can plug in these values into the equation to solve for $T_{2}$.\nStep 10:  First, we need to convert the formation energy from eV to Joules, which is $2.0 \\mathrm{eV} = 2.0 \\times 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{J} = 3.204 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{J}$.\nStep 11:  The Boltzmann constant is $k = 1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\mathrm{J/K}$.\nStep 12:  We can now plug in the values into the equation to solve for $T_{2}$.\nStep 13:  $T_{2} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{1073} - \\frac{1.38 \\times 10^{-23}}{3.204 \\times 10^{-19}} \\ln \\left( \\frac{10^{-3}}{10^{-4}} \\right)}$\nStep 14:  Simplifying the equation, we get $T_{2} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{1073} - \\frac{1.38 \\times 10^{-23}}{3.204 \\times 10^{-19}} \\ln (10)}$\nStep 15:  Evaluating the expression, we get $T_{2} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{1073} - \\frac{1.38 \\times 10^{-23}}{3.204 \\times 10^{-19}} \\times 2.3026}$\nStep 16:  Simplifying further, we get $T_{2} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{1073} - 1.35 \\times 10^{-5} \\times 2.3026}$\nStep 17:  Evaluating the expression, we get $T_{2} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{1073} - 3.11 \\times 10^{-5}}$\nStep 18:  Simplifying further, we get $T_{2} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{1073} - 3.11 \\times 10^{-5}}$\nStep 19:  Evaluating the expression, we get $T_{2} = \\frac{1}{0.000929 - 3.11 \\times 10^{-5}}$\nStep 20:  Simplifying further, we get $T_{2} = \\frac{1}{0.000929 - 0.000000311}$\nStep 21:  Evaluating the expression, we get $T_{2} = \\frac{1}{0.000929 - 0.000000311}$\nStep 22:  Simplifying further, we get $T_{2} = \\frac{1}{0.000929}$\nStep 23:  Evaluating the expression, we get $T_{2} = 1078.5 \\mathrm{K}$\nStep 24:  Converting the temperature from Kelvin to Celsius, we get $T_{2} = 1078.5 \\mathrm{K} - 273.15 = 805.35^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$\nStep 25:  Rounding the temperature to the nearest integer, we get $T_{2} = 805^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{805}$",

  "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem asks for the temperature at which germanium (Ge) becomes conductive, assuming no electron-hole pairs are produced until the temperature reaches the energy gap. This means we need to find the temperature at which the thermal energy (3/2 kT) equals the energy gap (E_th).\n\n## Step 2: Identify the given information\nThe energy gap (E_th) for germanium is given, but not explicitly stated in the problem. However, we know that the energy gap for germanium is approximately 0.67 eV.\n\n## Step 3: Convert the energy gap from eV to Joules\n1 eV = 1.602 x 10^-19 J, so the energy gap in Joules is:\nE_th = 0.67 eV x 1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV = 1.0734 x 10^-19 J\n\n## Step 4: Use the formula to find the temperature\nThe formula is E_th = 3/2 kT, where k is the Boltzmann constant (1.38 x 10^-23 J/K).

Void volume refers to the empty space between the atoms or molecules in a substance. In the hard-sphere approximation, atoms are treated as hard spheres with no interatomic potential, and the void volume is calculated based on the packing efficiency of these spheres.\nStep 3:  The molar volume of gold (Au) is given as $10.3 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3} / \\mathrm{mole}$. We need to use this information to calculate the total void volume.\nStep 4:  The hard-sphere approximation assumes that the atoms are packed in a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice, which has a packing efficiency of $\\frac{\\pi}{3\\sqrt{2}} \\approx 0.7405$. This means that the atoms occupy about $74.05\\%$ of the total volume, leaving $25.95\\%$ as void volume.\nStep 5:  To calculate the void volume, we can use the formula: $\\text{Void Volume} = \\text{Molar Volume} \\times (1 - \\text{Packing Efficiency})$.\nStep 6:  Substituting the given values, we get: $\\text{Void Volume} = 10.3 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3} / \\mathrm{mole} \\times (1 - 0.7405)$.\nStep 7:  Performing the calculation, we get: $\\text{Void Volume} = 10.3 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3} / \\mathrm{mole} \\times 0.2595 = 2.67 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3} / \\mathrm{mole}$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the total void volume for gold (Au) at $27^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ is approximately $2.67 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3} / \\mathrm{mole}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2.67}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of activation energy and its relationship with temperature.\nStep 2:  Activation energy is the minimum amount of energy required for a chemical reaction to occur. It is a measure of the energy barrier that must be overcome for the reaction to proceed.\nStep 3:  The Arrhenius equation relates the rate constant of a reaction to the activation energy and temperature: $k = Ae^{-E_{a} / R T}$, where $k$ is the rate constant, $A$ is the pre-exponential factor, $E_{a}$ is the activation energy, $R$ is the gas constant, and $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.\nStep 4:  We are given that the rate constant increases by a factor of three when the temperature is increased from room temperature (20\u00b0C) to 40\u00b0C. We need to find the activation energy of the process.\nStep 5:  First, we need to convert the temperatures from Celsius to Kelvin: $T_{1} = 20^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C} + 273 = 293 \\mathrm{~K}$ and $T_{2} = 40^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C} + 273 = 313 \\mathrm{~K}$.\nStep 6:  We can use the Arrhenius equation to relate the rate constants at the two temperatures: $\\frac{k_{2}}{k_{1}} = \\frac{A e^{-E_{a} / R T_{2}}}{A e^{-E_{a} / R T_{1}}} = e^{-E_{a} / R (T_{2} - T_{1})}$.\nStep 7:  We are given that the rate constant increases by a factor of three, so $\\frac{k_{2}}{k_{1}} = 3$. We can substitute this into the equation and solve for $E_{a}$.\nStep 8:  Rearranging the equation, we get: $E_{a} = -R \\ln \\left(\\frac{k_{2}}{k_{1}}\\right) / (T_{2} - T_{1})$.\nStep 9:  Plugging in the values, we get: $E_{a} = -8.314 \\ln (3) / (313 - 293) = -8.314 \\ln (3) / 20$.\nStep 10:  Evaluating the expression, we get: $E_{a} = -8.314 \\times 1.0986 / 20 = -9.1 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mole}$.\nStep 11:  Rounding to 1 decimal place, we get: $E_{a} = 9.1 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mole}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{9.1}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to calculate the relative electronegativity differences for the systems H-F and C-F using the given bond energies.\nStep 2:  First, let's recall the formula to calculate electronegativity difference: $\\Delta x = \\frac{1}{2}[(E_{A-A} + E_{B-B}) - 2E_{A-B}]$, where $E_{A-A}$ and $E_{B-B}$ are the bond energies of the homonuclear diatomic molecules, and $E_{A-B}$ is the bond energy of the heteronuclear diatomic molecule.\nStep 3:  For the system H-F, we need to calculate the electronegativity difference using the bond energies of H2, F2, and HF. The formula becomes: $\\Delta x_{H-F} = \\frac{1}{2}[(E_{H-H} + E_{F-F}) - 2E_{H-F}]$.\nStep 4:  Substituting the given bond energies, we get: $\\Delta x_{H-F} = \\frac{1}{2}[(436 + 172) - 2(565)]$.\nStep 5:  Simplifying the expression, we get: $\\Delta x_{H-F} = \\frac{1}{2}[608 - 1130]$.\nStep 6:  Further simplifying, we get: $\\Delta x_{H-F} = \\frac{1}{2}[-522]$.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the electronegativity difference for the system H-F is: $\\Delta x_{H-F} = -261$ eV.\nStep 8:  Next, let's calculate the electronegativity difference for the system C-F using the bond energies of C2, F2, and CF. The formula becomes: $\\Delta x_{C-F} = \\frac{1}{2}[(E_{C-C} + E_{F-F}) - 2E_{C-F}]$.\nStep 9:  Substituting the given bond energies, we get: $\\Delta x_{C-F} = \\frac{1}{2}[(335 + 172) - 2(410)]$.\nStep 10:  Simplifying the expression, we get: $\\Delta x_{C-F} = \\frac{1}{2}[507 - 820]$.\nStep 11:  Further simplifying, we get: $\\Delta x_{C-F} = \\frac{1}{2}[-313]$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the electronegativity difference for the system C-F is: $\\Delta x_{C-F} = -156.5$ eV.\nStep 13:  Now, let's calculate the difference in relative electronegativity between the two systems: $\\Delta x_{diff} = \\Delta x_{H-F} - \\Delta x_{C-F}$.\nStep 14:  Substituting the values, we get: $\\Delta x_{diff} = -261 - (-156.5)$.\nStep 15:  Simplifying the expression, we get: $\\Delta x_{diff} = -261 + 156.5$.\nStep 16:  Therefore, the difference in relative electronegativity between the two systems is: $\\Delta x_{diff} = -104.5$ eV.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-104.50}$",

  "Step 1: First, let's identify the chemical reaction and the information given in the problem. The reaction is: 2 NaI(aq) + Hg(NO3)2(aq) \u2192 HgI2(s) + 2 NaNO3(aq) We are given: - The concentration of NaI: 0.25 M - The volume of Hg(NO3)2 solution: 45 mL - The concentration of Hg(NO3)2: 0.10 M - The reaction equation: 2 NaI(aq) + Hg(NO3)2(aq) \u2192 HgI2(s) + 2 NaNO3(aq) Step 2: To find the volume of NaI needed to precipitate all the Hg2+ ion, we need to determine the number of moles of Hg2+ ion in the 45 mL of 0.10 M Hg(NO3)2 solution. We can use the formula: moles = concentration x volume (in liters) First, convert the volume from mL to L: 45 mL = 0.045 L Then, calculate the moles of Hg(NO3)2: moles = 0.10 M x 0.045 L = 0.0045 mol Since Hg(NO3)2 is a 1:1 solution, the number of moles of Hg2+ ion is equal to the number of moles of Hg(NO3)2. Therefore, the number of moles of Hg2+ ion is also 0.0045 mol. Step 3: According to the reaction equation, 2 moles of NaI are needed to precipitate 1 mole of Hg2+ ion. Therefore, the number of moles of NaI needed is twice the number of moles of Hg2+ ion: moles of NaI = 2 x 0.0045 mol = 0.009 mol Step 4: Now, we need to find the volume of NaI solution needed to provide 0.009 mol of NaI. We can use the formula: volume = moles / concentration First, convert the concentration from M to mol/L: 0.25 M = 0.25 mol/L Then, calculate the volume: volume = 0.009 mol / 0.25 mol/L = 0.036 L To convert the volume from L to mL, multiply by 1000: 0.036 L x 1000 = 36 mL Therefore, the volume of NaI solution needed is 36 mL. Step 5: Finally, we need to convert the volume from mL to the required unit, which is mL. Since the volume is already in mL, no conversion is needed. Therefore, the final answer is: \\boxed{36}",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of diffusion and how it applies to the given scenario. The problem involves a slab of plate glass containing dissolved helium, which is placed in a vacuum furnace at a temperature of $400^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ to remove the helium from the glass.\nStep 2:  We are given that the concentration of helium is constant throughout the glass before vacuum treatment. After 10 minutes in vacuum at $400^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, we need to find the depth from the surface of the glass at which the concentration of helium has decreased to $1 / 3$ of its initial value.\nStep 3:  The diffusion coefficient of helium in the plate glass at the processing temperature is given as $3.091 \\times 10^{-6} \\mathrm{~cm}^{2} / \\mathrm{s}$.\nStep 4:  We can use Fick's second law of diffusion to solve this problem. Fick's second law states that the concentration of a diffusing substance at a given point and time is proportional to the rate of diffusion and the concentration gradient at that point.\nStep 5:  Mathematically, Fick's second law is expressed as $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^{2} C}{\\partial x^{2}}$, where $C$ is the concentration, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, $t$ is time, and $x$ is the distance from the surface.\nStep 6:  We are given that the concentration of helium has decreased to $1 / 3$ of its initial value after 10 minutes, so we can use this information to find the depth at which this decrease occurs.\nStep 7:  We can use the equation $C(x, t) = C_{0} \\operatorname{erfc} \\left( \\frac{x}{2 \\sqrt{Dt}} \\right)$, where $C_{0}$ is the initial concentration, $x$ is the distance from the surface, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, and $t$ is time.\nStep 8:  We can substitute the given values into this equation to find the depth at which the concentration of helium has decreased to $1 / 3$ of its initial value.\nStep 9:  After solving the equation, we can find the depth in micrometers from the surface of the glass.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0.0005}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of half-life and how it relates to the age of the whiskey.\nStep 2:  The half-life of a radioactive substance is the time it takes for half of the initial amount of the substance to decay. In this case, the half-life of tritium ($^{3}H$) is given as 12.5 years.\nStep 3:  The activity of the whiskey is found to be 6% of that encountered in fresh bourbon. This means that the amount of tritium in the whiskey has decayed to 6% of its original amount.\nStep 4:  We can use the concept of half-life to determine the age of the whiskey. Since the activity has decayed to 6% of its original amount, we can calculate the number of half-lives that have passed.\nStep 5:  If the activity is 6% of the original, then the amount of tritium remaining is 6% of the original amount. This means that 94% of the tritium has decayed.\nStep 6:  Since each half-life reduces the amount of tritium by half, we can calculate the number of half-lives that have passed by dividing the percentage of tritium remaining by 50% (half-life).\nStep 7:  So, 6% remaining is equivalent to 12 half-lives (6% / 0.5 = 12).\nStep 8:  Therefore, the age of the whiskey is 12 half-lives of tritium, which is 12 * 12.5 years.\nStep 9:  Calculating this gives us the age of the whiskey in years.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{150}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between ionic radii, the Madelung constant, and the molar crystal energy of a compound.\nStep 2:  The molar crystal energy,

  "Step 1: The marginal rate of substitution (MRS) is the rate at which a consumer is willing to trade one good for another. It is defined as the ratio of the marginal utility of one good to the marginal utility of the other good. In this case, we need to find the MRS of good x to good y, which is given by the ratio of the partial derivative of the utility function with respect to x to the partial derivative of the utility function with respect to y.\n\nStep 2: The utility function is given by $u(x, y)=x^{\\frac{1}{2}}+y$. To find the partial derivatives, we'll differentiate the utility function with respect to x and y separately.\n\nStep 3: To find the partial derivative of the utility function with respect to x, we'll treat y as a constant and differentiate $x^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ with respect to x. Using the power rule of differentiation, we get $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\frac{1}{2}x^{-\\frac{1}{2}}$.\n\nStep 4: To find the partial derivative of the utility function with respect to y, we'll treat x as a constant and differentiate y with respect to y.

It is given by the ratio of the marginal utility of one good to the marginal utility of the other good.\n\nStep 2: To find the MRS, we need to find the partial derivatives of the utility function with respect to $x$ and $y$. The partial derivative of $u(x, y)$ with respect to $x$ is $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\frac{1}{2} x^{-\\frac{1}{2}}$, and the partial derivative of $u(x, y)$ with respect to $y$ is $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = 1$.\n\nStep 3: The MRS is given by the ratio of the partial derivatives: $MRS = -\\frac{\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}}{\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}} = -\\frac{\\frac{1}{2} x^{-\\frac{1}{2}}}{1} = -\\frac{1}{2} x^{-\\frac{1}{2}}$.\n\nStep 4: Now, let's consider the consumer's budget constraint. The price of the first good is $p$, and the price of the second good is $1$. The consumer's income is $m$. The budget constraint is given by $px + y = m$.\n\nStep 5: Since the price of the second good is $1$, we can substitute $y = 1$ into the budget constraint: $px + 1 = m$.\n\nStep 6: Rearranging the budget constraint, we get $px = m - 1$.\n\nStep 7: Solving for $x$, we get $x = \\frac{m - 1}{p}$.\n\nStep 8: However, we are given that the consumer's income is $m > \\frac{1}{4p}$. We need to find the quantity of the first good $(x)$ in the optimal consumption bundle.\n\nStep 9: To find the optimal consumption bundle, we need to maximize the utility function subject to the budget constraint.\n\nStep 10: Since the utility function is $u(x, y) = x^{\\frac{1}{2}} + y$, and the budget constraint is $px + y = m$, we can substitute $y = m - px$ into the utility function: $u(x) = x^{\\frac{1}{2}} + m - px$.\n\nStep 11: To maximize the utility function, we need to find the critical points by taking the derivative of $u(x)$ with respect to $x$ and setting it equal to zero.\n\nStep 12: The derivative of $u(x)$ with respect to $x$ is $\\frac{du}{dx} = \\frac{1}{2} x^{-\\frac{1}{2}} - p$.\n\nStep 13: Setting the derivative equal to zero, we get $\\frac{1}{2} x^{-\\frac{1}{2}} - p = 0$.\n\nStep 14: Solving for $x$, we get $x = \\left(\\frac{1}{2p}\\right)^2$.\n\nStep 15: However, we are given that the consumer's income is $m > \\frac{1}{4p}$.

  "Step 1:  To find the equilibrium price in the apple juice market, we need to determine the point at which the supply and demand curves intersect.\nStep 2:  The supply curve is given by $Q_{S} = 10P_{J} - 5P_{A}$, where $P_{J}$ is the price of apple juice and $P_{A}$ is the price of apples. We are given that $P_{A}$ is fixed at $\\$ 1$.\nStep 3:  The demand curve is given by $Q_{D} = 100 - 15P_{J} + 10P_{T}$, where $P_{T}$ is the price of tea. We are given that $P_{T} = 5$.\nStep 4:  To find the equilibrium price, we need to set the supply and demand equations equal to each other and solve for $P_{J}$.\nStep 5:  First, we substitute the given values into the supply and demand equations. For the supply curve, we have $Q_{S} = 10P_{J} - 5(1) = 10P_{J} - 5$. For the demand curve, we have $Q_{D} = 100 - 15P_{J} + 10(5) = 100 - 15P_{J} + 50 = 150 - 15P_{J}$.\nStep 6:  Now, we set the supply and demand equations equal to each other: $10P_{J} - 5 = 150 - 15P_{J}$.\nStep 7:  To solve for $P_{J}$, we need to isolate the variable. First, we add $15P_{J}$ to both sides of the equation to get $25P_{J} - 5 = 150$.\nStep 8:  Next, we add $5$ to both sides of the equation to get $25P_{J} = 155$.\nStep 9:  Finally, we divide both sides of the equation by $25$ to solve for $P_{J}$: $P_{J} = \\frac{155}{25} = 6.2$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the equilibrium price in the apple juice market is $\\$ 6.20$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6.2}$",
  "Problem: Preamble: In Cambridge, shoppers can buy apples from two sources: a local orchard, and a store that ships apples from out of state. The orchard can produce up to 50 apples per day at a constant marginal cost of 25 cents per apple. The store can supply any remaining apples demanded, at a constant marginal cost of 75 cents per unit. When apples cost 75 cents per apple, the residents of Cambridge buy 150 apples in a day.\n\nAssume that the city of Cambridge sets the price of apples within its borders. What price should it set, in cents? Step 1:  To find the optimal price that the city of Cambridge should set for apples, we need to consider the supply and demand of apples in the city. The local orchard can produce up to 50 apples per day at a marginal cost of 25 cents per apple, while the store can supply any remaining apples demanded at a marginal cost of 75 cents per unit.\nStep 2:  We are given that when apples cost 75 cents per apple, the residents of Cambridge buy 150 apples in a day. This information suggests that the demand for apples is 150 units when the price is 75 cents.\nStep 3:  Since the orchard can produce up to 50 apples per day, the remaining 100 apples (150 - 50) are supplied by the store. This means that the store's marginal cost of 75 cents per unit is the price at which the residents of Cambridge buy 150 apples in a day.\nStep 4:  Therefore, the optimal price that the city of Cambridge should set for apples is the price at which the demand for apples is 150 units, which is 75 cents per apple.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{75}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first understand the given information and the two options presented by Judge Judy.\nStep 2:  We are given the marginal cost (MC) and average total cost (ATC) at two different output levels, 5 and 4. The MC is the cost of producing one additional unit, and the ATC is the total cost divided by the number of units produced.\nStep 3:  The current market price is $\\$ 10 /$ can, and we need to find the tax imposed by Judge Judy, which is equivalent to either paying a lump sum in the amount of profits or imposing a tax of $\\$\\left[P-A T C\\left(q^{*}\\right)\\right]$ per can.\nStep 4:  We are asked to find the tax in dollars per can, which is the difference between the price and the ATC at the profit-maximizing output level $q^{*}$.\nStep 5:  To find the profit-maximizing output level, we need to determine the point where the marginal cost (MC) equals the market price ($\\$ 10$). This is because at this point, the additional revenue from selling one more unit equals the additional cost of producing that unit, resulting in maximum profit.\nStep 6:  From the given information, we see that at an output level of 4, the MC is $\\$ 4$, which is less than the market price of $\\$ 10$. Therefore, the profit-maximizing output level $q^{*}$ is 4.\nStep 7:  Now, we need to find the ATC at the profit-maximizing output level $q^{*} = 4$. The ATC is given by the total cost divided by the number of units produced. Since the total cost is not directly given, we can use the fact that the MC is the derivative of the total cost with respect to output. Therefore, the total cost can be found by integrating the MC with respect to output.\nStep 8:  Integrating the MC with respect to output from 0 to 4 gives us the total cost. Then, we can find the ATC by dividing the total cost by the number of units produced, which is 4.\nStep 9:  Once we have the ATC at the profit-maximizing output level $q^{*} = 4$, we can find the tax by subtracting the ATC from the market price, which is $\\$ 10$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the tax imposed by Judge Judy is $\\$ 10 - ATC(4)$ per can.\n\nNow, let's calculate the ATC at the profit-maximizing output level $q^{*} = 4$.\n\nThe total cost can be found by integrating the MC with respect to output from 0 to 4:\n\nTotal cost = $\\int_{0}^{4} MC(q) dq$\n\nSince the MC is given as $\\$ 4$ at an output level of 4, we can assume that the MC is constant at $\\$ 4$ for all output levels up to 4. Therefore, the total cost is:\n\nTotal cost = $\\int_{0}^{4} 4 dq = 4 \\cdot 4 = 16$\n\nNow, we can find the ATC by dividing the total cost by the number of units produced, which is 4:\n\nATC(4) = Total cost / 4 = 16 / 4 = 4\n\nTherefore, the tax imposed by Judge Judy is:\n\nTax = $\\$ 10 - ATC(4) = \\$ 10 - 4 = \\$ 6$\n\nSo, the tax imposed by Judge Judy is $\\$ 6$ per can.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$",
  "Step 1: Understand the problem and the given information. We are given two demand functions for strawberries, one for Albie and one for Bubbie.

We need to find Albie's (own-price) elasticity of demand, $\\epsilon_{q_{a}, p}$.\n\nStep 2: Recall the definition of elasticity of demand. The elasticity of demand is a measure of how much the quantity demanded of a good changes in response to a change in the price of that good. It is defined as $\\epsilon_{y, x}=\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x} \\frac{x}{y}$, where $y$ is the quantity demanded and $x$ is the price.\n\nStep 3: Identify the variables and functions involved in Albie's demand function. In Albie's demand function, $q_{a}(p)=p^{\\alpha} f_{a}\\left(I_{a}\\right)$, $q_{a}$ is the quantity demanded, $p$ is the price, $\\alpha$ is a parameter, $f_{a}\\left(I_{a}\\right)$ is a function of Albie's income $I_{a}$.\n\nStep 4: Find the partial derivative of Albie's demand function with respect to price $p$. To find the elasticity of demand, we need to find the partial derivative of $q_{a}$ with respect to $p$. Using the product rule, we get $\\frac{\\partial q_{a}}{\\partial p} = \\alpha p^{\\alpha-1} f_{a}\\left(I_{a}\\right)$.\n\nStep 5: Find the elasticity of demand using the definition. The elasticity of demand is given by $\\epsilon_{q_{a}, p}=\\frac{\\partial q_{a}}{\\partial p} \\frac{p}{q_{a}}$. Substituting the partial derivative found in Step 4, we get $\\epsilon_{q_{a}, p} = \\alpha p^{\\alpha-1} f_{a}\\left(I_{a}\\right) \\frac{p}{p^{\\alpha} f_{a}\\left(I_{a}\\right)}$.\n\nStep 6: Simplify the expression for elasticity of demand.

The final answer is $\\boxed{\\alpha \\frac{1}{p^{\\alpha-1}}}",

We are asked to find the equations of demand, represented by $P$ (price in dollars per ton) and $X_{d}$ (demand in millions of tons).\nStep 2:  The own price elasticity of demand is given by the formula $\\eta_{d} = \\frac{dX_{d}}{dP} \\cdot \\frac{P}{X_{d}}$. We are given that $\\eta_{d} = -0.25$, and we know that $P = 20$ and $X_{d} = 100$. We can use this information to find the derivative $\\frac{dX_{d}}{dP}$.\nStep 3:  Substituting the given values into the formula, we get $-0.25 = \\frac{dX_{d}}{dP} \\cdot \\frac{20}{100}$. Solving for $\\frac{dX_{d}}{dP}$, we find $\\frac{dX_{d}}{dP} = -0.25 \\cdot \\frac{100}{20} = -1.25$.\nStep 4:  Now that we have the derivative $\\frac{dX_{d}}{dP}$, we can use it to find the equation of demand. The general form of a linear demand curve is $X_{d} = a - bP$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants. We can use the given information to find the values of $a$ and $b$.\nStep 5:  We know that at $P = 20$, $X_{d} = 100$. Substituting these values into the demand equation, we get $100 = a - 20b$. We also know that $\\frac{dX_{d}}{dP} = -1.25$, which gives us the slope of the demand curve.\nStep 6:  The slope of the demand curve is given by $-b$, so we have $-b = -1.25$. Solving for $b$, we find $b = 1.25$.\nStep 7:  Now that we have the value of $b$, we can substitute it back into the demand equation to find the value of $a$. We have $100 = a - 20(1.25)$. Solving for $a$, we find $a = 100 + 25 = 125$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the equation of demand is $X_{d} = 125 - 1.25P$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{125 - 1.25P}$",
  "Step 1:  The problem involves a harmonic oscillator subject to a perturbation by an electric field.

The energy of the pulse is given as $2.00 \\mathrm{~mJ}$, and the wavelength of the laser light is $1.06 \\mu \\mathrm{m}$.\nStep 2:  First, we need to convert the energy of the pulse from millijoules to joules. We know that $1 \\mathrm{~mJ} = 10^{-3} \\mathrm{~J}$, so the energy of the pulse is $2.00 \\mathrm{~mJ} = 2.00 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{~J}$.\nStep 3:  Next, we need to calculate the energy of a single photon. The energy of a photon is given by the formula $E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$, where $h$ is Planck's constant, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of the light.\nStep 4:  We know that $h = 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{~J} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}$, $c = 3.00 \\times 10^8 \\mathrm{~m/s}$, and $\\lambda = 1.06 \\mu \\mathrm{m} = 1.06 \\times 10^{-6} \\mathrm{~m}$.\nStep 5:  Plugging these values into the formula, we get $E = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{~J} \\cdot \\mathrm{s})(3.00 \\times 10^8 \\mathrm{~m/s})}{1.06 \\times 10^{-6} \\mathrm{~m}} = 1.87 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{~J}$.\nStep 6:  Now, we can calculate the number of photons in the pulse by dividing the total energy of the pulse by the energy of a single photon. This gives us $\\frac{2.00 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{~J}}{1.87 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{~J}} = 1.07 \\times 10^{16}$ photons.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the number of photons in the pulse is $1.07 \\times 10^{16}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1.07 \\times 10^{16}}",
  "Step 1:  First, we need to understand the problem and the given information. We are dealing with the photoelectric effect, where ultraviolet radiation is used to emit electrons from a clean chromium surface. The work function of chromium is given as $4.40 \\mathrm{eV}$, and the wavelength of the ultraviolet radiation is $200 \\mathrm{~nm}$.\nStep 2:  The work function is the minimum energy required to remove an electron from the surface of a material. In this case, the work function of chromium is $4.40 \\mathrm{eV}$, which means that an electron needs at least $4.40 \\mathrm{eV}$ of energy to be emitted from the chromium surface.\nStep 3:  The wavelength of the ultraviolet radiation is given as $200 \\mathrm{~nm}$. We need to convert this wavelength to energy using the formula $E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$, where $h$ is Planck's constant, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\\lambda$ is the wavelength.\nStep 4:  First, we need to convert the wavelength from nanometers to meters. $200 \\mathrm{~nm} = 200 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{m}$.\nStep 5:  Next, we can use the formula $E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$ to calculate the energy of the ultraviolet radiation. $E = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{Js})(3.00 \\times 10^8 \\mathrm{m/s})}{200 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{m}} = 9.939 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{J}$.\nStep 6:  However, the work function is given in electronvolts (eV), so we need to convert the energy from Joules to electronvolts. $1 \\mathrm{eV} = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{J}$, so $9.939 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{J} = \\frac{9.939 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{J}}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{J/eV}} = 6.21 \\mathrm{eV}$.\nStep 7:  Now, we can calculate the kinetic energy of the electrons emitted from the chromium surface. The kinetic energy is given by $KE = E - W$, where $E$ is the energy of the ultraviolet radiation and $W$ is the work function.\nStep 8:  Therefore, $KE = 6.21 \\mathrm{eV} - 4.40 \\mathrm{eV} = 1.81 \\mathrm{eV}$.\nStep 9:  Finally, we need to convert the kinetic energy from electronvolts to Joules. $1.81 \\mathrm{eV} = 1.81 \\times 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{J} = 2.90 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{J}$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the kinetic energy of the electrons emitted from the chromium surface is $2.90 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{J}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2.90 \\times 10^{-19}}",

Substituting the values, we get $\\nu=(3 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}) / (500 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{~m})=6 \\times 10^{14} \\mathrm{~Hz}$.\nStep 4:  Now that we have the frequency, we can calculate the energy of the photon using the formula $E_{\\text {photon }}=h \\nu$. Substituting the values, we get $E_{\\text {photon }}=(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{~J} \\mathrm{~s}) \\times(6 \\times 10^{14} \\mathrm{~Hz})=3.98 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{~J}$.\nStep 5:  Finally, we can calculate the momentum of the photon using the formula $p_{\\text {photon }}=E_{\\text {photon }} / c$. Substituting the values, we get $p_{\\text {photon }}=(3.98 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{~J}) / (3 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s})=1.33 \\times 10^{-27} \\mathrm{~kg} \\cdot \\mathrm{m} / \\mathrm{s}$.\nStep 6:  Rounding the answer to three decimal places, we get $p_{\\text {photon }}=1.33 \\times 10^{-27} \\mathrm{~kg} \\cdot \\mathrm{m} / \\mathrm{s}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1.33 \\times 10^{-27}}",

  "Step 1:  To find the de Broglie wavelength of the baseball, we first need to calculate its momentum, which is given by the product of its mass and velocity.\nStep 2:  The mass of the baseball is given as $145 \\mathrm{~g}$, which we need to convert to kilograms. Since $1 \\mathrm{~kg} = 1000 \\mathrm{~g}$, the mass in kilograms is $145 \\mathrm{~g} \\times \\frac{1 \\mathrm{~kg}}{1000 \\mathrm{~g}} = 0.145 \\mathrm{~kg}$.\nStep 3:  The velocity of the baseball is given as $1 \\mathrm{~nm} /$ second. We need to convert this to meters per second. Since $1 \\mathrm{~nm} = 10^{-9} \\mathrm{~m}$, the velocity in meters per second is $1 \\mathrm{~nm} /$ second $= 10^{-9} \\mathrm{~m} /$ second.\nStep 4:  Now, we can calculate the momentum using the formula $p = m \\nu$. Substituting the values, we get $p = 0.145 \\mathrm{~kg} \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{~m} /$ second $= 1.45 \\times 10^{-10} \\mathrm{~kg} \\cdot \\mathrm{m} /$ second.\nStep 5:  Next, we need to calculate the de Broglie wavelength using the formula $\\lambda = \\frac{h}{p}$. The Planck constant $h$ is given as $6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{~J} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}$. Substituting the values, we get $\\lambda = \\frac{6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{~J} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}}{1.45 \\times 10^{-10} \\mathrm{~kg} \\cdot \\mathrm{m} /$ second}.\nStep 6:  Simplifying the expression, we get $\\lambda = \\frac{6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{~J} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}}{1.45 \\times 10^{-10} \\mathrm{~kg} \\cdot \\mathrm{m} /$ second} $= 4.57 \\times 10^{-24} \\mathrm{~m}$.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the de Broglie wavelength of the baseball is $4.57 \\times 10^{-24} \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4.57 \\times 10^{-24}}$",
  "The average energy of the system in the superposition state $\\psi_{1,2}$ is given by the expectation value of the energy operator $H$ in the state $\\psi_{1,2}$, which is\n\\[\n\\langle E \\rangle = \\langle \\psi_{1,2} | H | \\psi_{1,2} \\rangle\n\\]\nSince $\\psi_{1,2}$ is a superposition of the eigenstates $\\psi_{1}$ and $\\psi_{2}$, we can write\n\\[\n\\psi_{1,2} = (1 / 3)^{1 / 2} \\psi_{1} + (2 / 3)^{1 / 2} \\psi_{2}\n\\]\nThe energy operator $H$ is diagonal in the basis of eigenstates $\\psi_{1}$ and $\\psi_{2}$, so we have\n\\[\nH \\psi_{1} = E_{1} \\psi_{1}\n\\]\n\\[\nH \\psi_{2} = E_{2} \\psi_{2}\n\\]\nSubstituting these expressions into the expectation value, we get\n\\[\n\\langle E \\rangle = \\langle \\psi_{1,2} | H | \\psi_{1,2} \\rangle = (1 / 3)^{1 / 2} \\langle \\psi_{1} | H | \\psi_{1} \\rangle + (2 / 3)^{1 / 2} \\langle \\psi_{2} | H | \\psi_{2} \\rangle\n\\]\nUsing the fact that $H \\psi_{1} = E_{1} \\psi_{1}$ and $H \\psi_{2} = E_{2} \\psi_{2}$, we get\n\\[\n\\langle E \\rangle = (1 / 3)^{1 / 2} E_{1} + (2 / 3)^{1 / 2} E_{2}\n\\]\nSimplifying, we get\n\\[\n\\langle E \\rangle = (1 / 3) E_{1} + (2 / 3) E_{2}\n\\]\nTherefore, the average energy of the system in the superposition state $\\psi_{1,2}$ is\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3} E_{1} + \\frac{2}{3} E_{2}}\n\\]",
  "Step 1:  The problem presents a superposition state wavefunction, $\\psi_{1,2}=(1 / 3)^{1 / 2} \\psi_{1}+(2 / 3)^{1 / 2} \\psi_{2}$, where $\\psi_{1}$ and $\\psi_{2}$ are eigenstates with corresponding eigen-energies $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$.\nStep 2:  The task is to determine the possible results of measuring the energy of this superposition state $\\psi_{1,2}$.\nStep 3:  To approach this, we need to understand the concept of superposition in quantum mechanics. A superposition state is a linear combination of two or more states, and when measured, it collapses to one of the possible states with a probability determined by the coefficients of the superposition.\nStep 4:  In this case, the superposition state $\\psi_{1,2}$ is a linear combination of $\\psi_{1}$ and $\\psi_{2}$ with coefficients $(1 / 3)^{1 / 2}$ and $(2 / 3)^{1 / 2}$, respectively.\nStep 5:  When measuring the energy of $\\psi_{1,2}$, the possible results are the eigen-energies of the individual states, which are $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$.\nStep 6:  The probability of measuring each eigen-energy is determined by the square of the absolute value of the corresponding coefficient in the superposition. Therefore, the probability of measuring $E_{1}$ is $| (1 / 3)^{1 / 2} |^2 = 1 / 3$, and the probability of measuring $E_{2}$ is $| (2 / 3)^{1 / 2} |^2 = 2 / 3$.\nStep 7:  Since the probabilities add up to 1, the possible results of measuring the energy of $\\psi_{1,2}$ are $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$, each with probabilities 1/3 and 2/3, respectively.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{E_{1}, E_{2}}$",

The eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors, so we have $\\mathbf{v}_1=(1,0,0), \\mathbf{v}_2=(0,1,0), \\mathbf{v}_3=(0,0,1)$.\nStep 4:  Next, we need to find the first-order correction to the energy, which is given by $E^{(1)}=\\langle \\mathbf{v}_1|\\mathbf{H}^{(1)}|\\mathbf{v}_1\\rangle$. In this case, we have $E^{(1)}=\\langle (1,0,0)|\\left(\\begin{array}{ccc}1 & 2 & 2 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 2 \\\\ 0 & 2 & -10\\end{array}\\right)|(1,0,0)\\rangle=1$.\nStep 5:  Then, we need to find the second-order correction to the energy, which is given by $E^{(2)}=\\sum_{n\\neq 1}\\frac{|\\langle \\mathbf{v}_n|\\mathbf{H}^{(1)}|\\mathbf{v}_1\\rangle|^2}{E^{(0)}_1-E^{(0)}_n}$. In this case, we have $E^{(2)}=\\frac{|\\langle (0,1,0)|\\mathbf{H}^{(1)}|(1,0,0)\\rangle|^2}{10-0}+\\frac{|\\langle (0,0,1)|\\mathbf{H}^{(1)}|(1,0,0)\\rangle|^2}{10-(-10)}=\\frac{1}{10}+\\frac{4}{20}=0.2+0.2=0.4$.\nStep 6:  Finally, we need to find the total energy $E_{\\widetilde{10}}$ by adding the zero-order energy, the first-order correction, and the second-order correction. In this case, we have $E_{\\widetilde{10}}=E^{(0)}_1+E^{(1)}+E^{(2)}=10+1+0.4=11.4$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{11.4}$"
