  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of relative motion and how to calculate the time it takes for Alicia and Beth to meet.\nStep 2:  First, we need to determine the combined speed at which Alicia and Beth are approaching each other. Since they are moving towards each other, their speeds add up. So, the combined speed is $18 + 12 = 30$ miles per hour.\nStep 3:  Next, we need to find the time it takes for them to meet. We can use the formula $time = \\frac{distance}{speed}$. In this case, the distance is $45$ miles, and the combined speed is $30$ miles per hour. Therefore, the time it takes for them to meet is $\\frac{45}{30} = 1.5$ hours.\nStep 4:  Now that we have the time, we can calculate the distance each person travels before they meet. Alicia's speed is $18$ miles per hour, so in $1.5$ hours, she will travel $18 \\times 1.5 = 27$ miles. Similarly, Beth's speed is $12$ miles per hour, so in $1.5$ hours, she will travel $12 \\times 1.5 = 18$ miles.\nStep 5:  Since they are traveling towards each other, the total distance they cover before meeting is the sum of the distances each of them travels, which is $27 + 18 = 45$ miles.\nStep 6:  Therefore, when they meet, they will be $45$ miles from City $A$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{45}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given equations and use algebraic manipulations to find the values of $x$ and $y$.\nStep 2:  We are given two equations: $y^3=x^2$ and $(y-x)^2=4y^2$. Our goal is to find the value of $x+y$.\nStep 3:  First, we can rewrite the second equation as $y^2-2xy+x^2=4y^2$, which simplifies to $x^2-2xy-3y^2=0$.\nStep 4:  This equation can be factored as $(x-3y)(x+y)=0$. Since $x$ and $y$ are positive real numbers, we can conclude that $x=3y$.\nStep 5:  Substituting $x=3y$ into the first equation $y^3=x^2$, we get $y^3=(3y)^2$, which simplifies to $y^3=9y^2$.\nStep 6:  Dividing both sides by $y^2$ (since $y$ is positive, we can safely divide by $y^2$), we obtain $y=9$.\nStep 7:  Now that we have found the value of $y$, we can substitute it back into the equation $x=3y$ to find the value of $x$. This gives us $x=3(9)=27$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the sum of $x$ and $y$ is $x+y=27+9=36$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{36}$",
  "Problem: What is the degree measure of the acute angle formed by lines with slopes $2$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$?\nStep 1:  To find the degree measure of the acute angle formed by lines with slopes $2$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$, we can use the formula that relates the slopes of two lines to the angle between them.\nStep 2:  The formula states that the angle $\\theta$ between two lines with slopes $m_1$ and $m_2$ is given by $\\tan \\theta = \\left| \\frac{m_1 - m_2}{1 + m_1 m_2} \\right|$.\nStep 3:  In this case, the slopes of the two lines are $2$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$, so we can substitute these values into the formula to find the angle $\\theta$.\nStep 4:  Plugging in the values, we get $\\tan \\theta = \\left| \\frac{2 - \\frac{1}{3}}{1 + 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}} \\right|$.\nStep 5:  Simplifying the expression inside the absolute value, we have $\\tan \\theta = \\left| \\frac{\\frac{5}{3}}{\\frac{5}{3}} \\right|$.\nStep 6:  This simplifies to $\\tan \\theta = 1$.\nStep 7:  The angle whose tangent is $1$ is $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ radians or $45^\\circ$.\nStep 8:  Since we are looking for the acute angle, the degree measure of the acute angle formed by the lines with slopes $2$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ is $\\boxed{45}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{45}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to carefully evaluate the given expression, which involves a series of cubes of consecutive numbers.\nStep 2:  The expression is a sum of terms in the form of $a^3 - b^3$, where $a$ and $b$ are consecutive numbers.\nStep 3:  We can start by recognizing that the given expression can be written as a sum of differences of cubes, which can be factored using the difference of cubes formula: $a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)$.\nStep 4:  Applying this formula to each term in the given expression, we get: $2^3 - 1^3 + 4^3 - 3^3 + 6^3 - 5^3 + \\dots + 18^3 - 17^3 = (2-1)(2^2+2\\cdot1+1^2) + (4-3)(4^2+4\\cdot3+3^2) + (6-5)(6^2+6\\cdot5+5^2) + \\dots + (18-17)(18^2+18\\cdot17+17^2)$.\nStep 5:  Simplifying each term, we get: $(2-1)(2^2+2\\cdot1+1^2) + (4-3)(4^2+4\\cdot3+3^2) + (6-5)(6^2+6\\cdot5+5^2) + \\dots + (18-17)(18^2+18\\cdot17+17^2) = (1)(7) + (1)(35) + (1)(91) + \\dots + (1)(919)$.\nStep 6:  Now, we can see that each term in the sum is of the form $(1)(n^2+3n+3)$, where $n$ is a positive integer.\nStep 7:  We can further simplify the expression by factoring out the common factor of $1$ from each term, giving us: $1(7+35+91+\\dots+919)$.\nStep 8:  The sum inside the parentheses is an arithmetic series with a common difference of $28$. We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to find the sum of this series.\nStep 9:  The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is: $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$, where $S_n$ is the sum of the first $n$ terms, $a_1$ is the first term, and $a_n$ is the last term.\nStep 10:  In this case, the first term is $7$, the last term is $919$, and the common difference is $28$. We can use the formula to find the number of terms in the series, which is $n = \\frac{919-7}{28}+1 = 33$.\nStep 11:  Now that we have the number of terms, we can use the formula to find the sum of the series: $S_{33} = \\frac{33}{2}(7+919) = \\frac{33}{2}(926) = 15393$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the value of the given expression is $1(15393) = \\boxed{15393}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{15393}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given information and set up equations to represent the relationships between the number of games won by left-handed and right-handed players.\nStep 2:  Let's denote the number of left-handed players as $L$ and the number of right-handed players as $R$. We are given that there are twice as many right-handed players as left-handed players, so we can express this as $R = 2L$.\nStep 3:  The total number of games played can be calculated using the combination formula, which is given by $\\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$, where $n$ is the total number of participants.

This can be expressed as $1.4R = L$.\nStep 5:  We can use these two equations to solve for the values of $L$ and $R$.\nStep 6:  Substituting $R = 2L$ into the equation $1.4R = L$, we get $1.4(2L) = L$, which simplifies to $2.8L = L$. This implies that $L = 0$, which is not a valid solution as it would mean there are no left-handed players.\nStep 7:  Therefore, we need to re-examine our approach and consider the relationship between the number of games won by left-handed and right-handed players.\nStep 8:  Let's denote the number of games won by right-handed players as $x$.

Let $z=a+bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers.\nStep 3:  Substituting $z=a+bi$ into the given equation, we get $|1+(a+bi)+(a+bi)^{2}|=4$.\nStep 4:  Expanding the expression, we have $|1+(a+bi)+(a^{2}-b^{2}+2abi)|=4$, which simplifies to $|a^{2}+2abi+b^{2}+a+bi+1|=4$.\nStep 5:  This further simplifies to $|a^{2}+b^{2}+a+(b+1)i|=4$.\nStep 6:  Using the definition of the modulus of a complex number, we can express this as $\\sqrt{(a^{2}+b^{2}+a)^{2}+(b+1)^{2}}=4$.\nStep 7:  Squaring both sides of the equation, we get $(a^{2}+b^{2}+a)^{2}+(b+1)^{2}=16$.\nStep 8:  Expanding and simplifying, we arrive at the equation $a^{4}+2a^{3}+5a^{2}+2ab+b^{2}-8a-8b+8=0$.\nStep 9:  We can then use the method of completing the square to rewrite this equation in a more manageable form.\nStep 10:  After completing the square, we obtain the equation $(a^{2}+a+\\frac{1}{4})^{2}+(b^{2}-4a-4b+4)^{2}=\\frac{69}{4}$.\nStep 11:  From this, we can deduce that $a^{2}+a+\\frac{1}{4}\\geq 0$ and $b^{2}-4a-4b+4\\geq 0$.\nStep 12:  We then use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to derive the inequality $(1+4)(a^{2}+a+\\frac{1}{4})\\geq (a+2b+1)^{2}$.\nStep 13:  Simplifying this inequality, we find that $(a+2b+1)^{2}\\leq \\frac{69}{4}$.\nStep 14:  Taking the square root of both sides, we get $a+2b+1\\leq \\frac{3\\sqrt{69}}{2}$.\nStep 15:  Finally, we can express the maximum value of the imaginary part of $z$ as $\\frac{\\sqrt{69}}{2}$.\nStep 16:  Therefore, the maximum value of the imaginary part of $z$ can be written in the form $\\tfrac{\\sqrt{69}}{2}$, and the sum of the relatively prime positive integers $m$ and $n$ is $69+2=\\boxed{71}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{71}$",

Since Flora can only jump a positive integer distance, we need to find the combinations of jumps that sum up to 10.\nStep 3:  The possible combinations of jumps that sum up to 10 are: 1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1, 1+1+1+1+1+1+1+2, 1+1+1+1+1+1+3, 1+1+1+1+1+4, 1+1+1+1+5, 1+1+1+6, 1+1+7, 1+8, 9.\nStep 4:  Now, we need to calculate the probability of each of these combinations occurring.

We are given that $o = \\frac{1}{4}$ of a pound.\nStep 4:  We can now set up an equation based on the given information. The weight of $\\frac{1}{3}$ of a large pizza is $\\frac{1}{3}p$, and the weight of $3 \\frac{1}{2}$ cups of orange slices is $3 \\frac{1}{2}o$. Similarly, the weight of $\\frac{3}{4}$ of a large pizza is $\\frac{3}{4}p$, and the weight of $\\frac{1}{2}$ cup of orange slices is $\\frac{1}{2}o$.\nStep 5:  The equation representing the given situation is: $\\frac{1}{3}p + 3 \\frac{1}{2}o = \\frac{3}{4}p + \\frac{1}{2}o$.\nStep 6:  We can simplify the equation by converting the mixed number $3 \\frac{1}{2}$ to an improper fraction, which is $\\frac{7}{2}$. Similarly, we can convert the mixed number $\\frac{1}{2}$ to an improper fraction, which is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\nStep 7:  Substituting the values of $o$ and the improper fractions into the equation, we get: $\\frac{1}{3}p + \\frac{7}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}p + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}$.\nStep 8:  Simplifying the equation further, we get: $\\frac{1}{3}p + \\frac{7}{8} = \\frac{3}{4}p + \\frac{1}{8}$.\nStep 9:  To isolate the variable $p$, we can first multiply the entire equation by $24$ to clear the fractions, resulting in: $8p + 21 = 18p + 3$.\nStep 10:  Next, we can subtract $8p$ from both sides of the equation to get: $21 = 10p + 3$.\nStep 11:  Then, we can subtract $3$ from both sides to get: $18 = 10p$.\nStep 12:  Finally, we can solve for $p$ by dividing both sides by $10$, giving us: $p = \\frac{18}{10}$.\nStep 13:  Therefore, the weight of a large pizza is $\\frac{18}{10}$ pounds.\nStep 14:  To find the final answer, we need to calculate $m-n$, where $m$ and $n$ are the numerator and denominator of the fraction $\\frac{18}{10}$, respectively.\nStep 15:  The numerator $m$ is $18$ and the denominator $n$ is $10$.

To do this, we need to consider the pattern of the units digits in the rows.\nStep 4:  Starting with the first row, the units digit is 1. Moving to the second row, the units digit is 1 + 1 = 2. In the third row, the units digit is 1 + 3 + 1 = 5. Continuing this pattern, we find that the units digit of the sum of the numbers in each row follows a repeating pattern of 1, 2, 5, 8, 3, 0, 3, 6, 9, 4, 7, 1, and so on.\nStep 5:  This pattern repeats every 12 rows. Since 2023 is 1 more than a multiple of 12, the units digit of the sum of the 2023 numbers in the 2023rd row will be the same as the units digit of the sum of the numbers in the first row, which is 1.\nStep 6:  Therefore, the units digit of the sum of the 2023 numbers in the 2023rd row is $\\boxed{1}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

Since the icosahedron is symmetric, the probability of $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$ is the same as the probability of $d(Q, S) > d(R, S)$.\nStep 8:  This allows us to consider the cases where $d(Q, S) > d(R, S)$ and $d(Q, S) = d(R, S)$ separately.\nStep 9:  If $d(Q, S) > d(R, S)$, then we can consider the possible distances between $Q$ and $S$ and how they relate to the distance between $R$ and $S$.\nStep 10:  If $d(Q, S) = d(R, S)$, then we can consider the possible distances between $Q$ and $R$ and how they relate to the distance between $R$ and $S$.\nStep 11:  By considering these cases, we can determine the probability that $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$.\nStep 12:  We can then use this probability to find the final answer, which is the sum of the numerator and denominator of the probability fraction.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{11}$",

16:",
  "Step 1:  To solve the given equation, we first need to expand the left-hand side and then simplify it to a form that allows us to find the values of $a$ and $b$ that satisfy the equation.\nStep 2:  The given equation is $(1+2a)(2+2b)(2a+b) = 32ab.$ We can start by expanding the left-hand side using the distributive property.\nStep 3:  After expanding, we get $(1+2a)(2+2b)(2a+b) = (2+2b+4a+4ab)(2a+b) = 2(2a+b) + 2b(2a+b) + 4a(2a+b) + 4ab(2a+b).$\nStep 4:  Simplifying this expression, we get $4a + 2b + 4ab + 4a^2 + 2ab + 4a^2b + 8a^2b + 4ab^2.$\nStep 5:  Combining like terms, we have $4a^2 + 4ab + 4a^2b + 4ab^2 + 4a^2b + 8a^2b + 2b + 2ab + 4ab.$\nStep 6:  Further simplifying, we get $4a^2 + 4ab + 4a^2b + 4ab^2 + 12a^2b + 2b + 6ab.$\nStep 7:  Factoring out common terms, we have $4a^2 + 4ab + 4a^2b + 4ab^2 + 12a^2b + 2b + 6ab = 4a^2 + 4ab + 4a^2b + 4ab^2 + 12a^2b + 2b + 6ab.$\nStep 8:  We can factor out a $4ab$ from the first four terms and a $2b$ from the last two terms, giving us $4ab(1+a+b) + 2b(2+6a).$\nStep 9:  Factoring out a $2b$ from the last two terms, we get $4ab(1+a+b) + 2b(2+6a) = 2b(2+6a+2a+2b).$\nStep 10:  Simplifying further, we have $2b(2+6a+2a+2b) = 2b(2+8a+2b).$\nStep 11:  Now, we can rewrite the equation as $2b(2+8a+2b) = 32ab.$\nStep 12:  Dividing both sides by $2b$, we get $2+8a+2b = 16a.$\nStep 13:  Rearranging the terms, we have $2+8a+2b = 16a.$\nStep 14:  Subtracting $8a$ from both sides, we get $2+2b = 8a.$\nStep 15:  Subtracting $2$ from both sides, we have $2b = 8a - 2.$\nStep 16:  Dividing both sides by $2$, we get $b = 4a - 1.$\nStep 17:  Now, we can substitute $b = 4a - 1$ into the original equation to solve for $a$.\nStep 18:  Substituting $b = 4a - 1$ into the equation $(1+2a)(2+2b)(2a+b) = 32ab,$ we get $(1+2a)(2+2(4a-1))(2a+4a-1) = 32a(4a-1).$\nStep 19:  Expanding and simplifying, we get $(1+2a)(8+8a-2)(6a-1) = 128a^2 - 32a.$\nStep 20:  Further simplifying, we have $(1+2a)(6a+6a^2-1)(6a-1) = 128a^2 - 32a.$\nStep 21:  Expanding and simplifying, we get $(1+2a)(6a+6a^2-1)(6a-1) = 128a^2 - 32a.$\nStep 22:  Expanding and simplifying, we get $(1+2a)(36a^2+36a-6a-6a^2+6a-1)(6a-1) = 128a^2 - 32a.$\nStep 23:  Simplifying further, we have $(1+2a)(30a^2+36a-1)(6a-1) = 128a^2 - 32a.$\nStep 24:  Expanding and simplifying, we get $(1+2a)(180a^3+180a^2-30a^2-36a+30a^2+36a-6a^2-6a+6a-1)(6a-1) = 128a^2 - 32a.$\nStep 25:  Simplifying further, we have $(1+2a)(180a^3+180a^2-30a^2+30a^2-6a^2+6a-1)(6a-1) = 128a^2 - 32a.$\nStep 26:  Expanding and simplifying, we get $(1+2a)(180a^3+180a^2-6a^2+6a-1)(6a-1) = 128a^2 - 32a.$\nStep 27:  Expanding and simplifying, we get $(1+2a)(180a^3+174a^2+6a-1)(6a-1) = 128a^2 - 32a.$\nStep 28:  Expanding and simplifying, we get $(1+2a)(1080a^4+1080a^3+174a^2+6a^3+36a^2+6a-6a^2-6a+6a-1)(6a-1) = 128a^2 -

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the conditions given for the sequences $A_1$, $A_2$, $\\dots$, $A_n$.\nStep 2:  Each $A_i$ is a subset of the set $\\{1, 2, 3, \\dots, 10\\}$, and $A_{i-1}$ is a subset of $A_i$ for each $i$ between $2$ and $n$, inclusive.\nStep 3:  We are asked to find the number of such sequences, denoted as $K$, and then find the remainder when $K$ is divided by $10$.\nStep 4:  To approach this problem, we can use a recursive method to count the number of valid sequences.\nStep 5:  We start by considering the first element of the sequence, which can be any subset of $\\{1, 2, 3, \\dots, 10\\}$. Let's denote this subset as $A_1$.\nStep 6:  For each element $i$ in the set $\\{1, 2, 3, \\dots, 10\\}$, we have two choices: either include $i$ in $A_1$ or not include it. This gives us $2^{10}$ possible subsets for $A_1$.\nStep 7:  Now, for each element $i$ in the set $\\{1, 2, 3, \\dots, 10\\}$, we have two choices: either include $i$ in $A_2$ or not include it. However, if $i$ is not in $A_1$, then it cannot be in $A_2$. This gives us $2^{10}$ possible subsets for $A_2$.\nStep 8:  We continue this process for each element $i$ in the set $\\{1, 2, 3, \\dots, 10\\}$, considering the choices for $A_3$, $A_4$, and so on.\nStep 9:  By the end of this process, we have $2^{10}$ possible subsets for $A_{10}$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the total number of valid sequences is $2^{10} \\cdot 2^{10} \\cdot 2^{10} \\cdot \\dots \\cdot 2^{10}$, where there are $10$ terms in the product.\nStep 11:  This simplifies to $2^{10 \\cdot 10} = 2^{100}$.\nStep 12:  To find the remainder when $K$ is divided by $10$, we need to find the remainder when $2^{100}$ is divided by $10$.\nStep 13:  We can use the property that $2^4 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{10}$ to simplify the calculation.\nStep 14:  This gives us $2^{100} \\equiv (2^4)^{25} \\equiv 6^{25} \\pmod{10}$.\nStep 15:  We can further simplify this by using the property that $6^2 \\equiv 36 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{10}$.\nStep 16:  This gives us $6^{25} \\equiv (6^2)^{12} \\cdot 6 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{10}$.\nStep 17:  Therefore, the remainder when $K$ is divided by $10$ is $\\boxed{6}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$",

  "Step 1:  To find the number of digits in the base-ten representation of $8^5 \\cdot 5^{10} \\cdot 15^5$, we first need to simplify the expression and then convert it to base-ten.\nStep 2:  We start by simplifying the expression $8^5 \\cdot 5^{10} \\cdot 15^5$. We can rewrite $15^5$ as $(3 \\cdot 5)^5$, which simplifies to $3^5 \\cdot 5^5$.\nStep 3:  Substituting this back into the original expression, we get $8^5 \\cdot 5^{10} \\cdot 3^5 \\cdot 5^5$.\nStep 4:  We can then combine the powers of $5$ to get $8^5 \\cdot 3^5 \\cdot 5^{15}$.\nStep 5:  Now, we need to convert this expression to base-ten. We can do this by evaluating the powers of $8$ and $3$ and then multiplying the results by $5^{15}$.\nStep 6:  Evaluating $8^5$ gives us $32768$, and evaluating $3^5$ gives us $243$.\nStep 7:  Multiplying these results by $5^{15}$ gives us $32768 \\cdot 243 \\cdot 5^{15}$.\nStep 8:  We can simplify this further by evaluating $5^{15}$, which gives us $3,051,025,000,000$.\nStep 9:  Multiplying $32768$ and $243$ gives us $7,955,584$.\nStep 10:  Multiplying this result by $5^{15}$ gives us $7,955,584 \\cdot 3,051,025,000,000$.\nStep 11:  Evaluating this product gives us $24,301,411,111,111,111,040$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the number of digits in the base-ten representation of $8^5 \\cdot 5^{10} \\cdot 15^5$ is $\\boxed{40}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{40}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to consider the different ways Janet can roll a running total of $3$ at some point during her $4$ rolls of a standard $6$-sided die.\nStep 2:  We'll start by considering the cases where Janet rolls a $3$ on her first roll. In this case, she can roll any number on the remaining $3$ rolls, so there are $6^3 = 216$ possible outcomes.\nStep 3:  Next, we'll consider the case where Janet rolls a $2$ on her first roll. In this case, she needs to roll a $1$ on her second roll to reach a running total of $3$. Then, she can roll any number on the remaining $2$ rolls, giving us $6^2 = 36$ possible outcomes.\nStep 4:  Similarly, if Janet rolls a $1$ on her first roll, she needs to roll a $2$ on her second roll to reach a running total of $3$. Then, she can roll any number on the remaining $2$ rolls, giving us another $36$ possible outcomes.\nStep 5:  We also need to consider the case where Janet rolls a $3$ on her second roll. In this case, she can roll any number on the first roll, giving us $6$ possible outcomes.\nStep 6:  Finally, we'll consider the case where Janet rolls a $3$ on her third roll.

This implies that the total sum of her quiz scores will become $nx + 33$.\nStep 5:  We can set up an equation based on this information: $nx + 11 = (n+1)(x+1)$ and $nx + 33 = (n+3)(x+1)$.\nStep 6:  By simplifying these equations, we get $nx + 11 = nx + n + x + 1$ and $nx + 33 = nx + 3n + 3x + 3$.\nStep 7:  From the first equation, we can see that $n + x = 10$, and from the second equation, we can see that $3n + 3x = 30$.\nStep 8:  Solving these two equations simultaneously will give us the values of $n$ and $x$.\nStep 9:  We can solve for $n$ in the first equation and substitute it into the second equation to find the value of $x$.\nStep 10:  After solving for $x$, we will have the current mean of Maureen's quiz scores.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the situation and what is being asked. Mrs. Jones has four identical glasses, and she fills the first three glasses completely but only fills the fourth glass $\\frac{1}{3}$ full due to running out of juice.\nStep 2:  The goal is to find the fraction of a glass that Mrs. Jones must pour from each of the first three glasses into the fourth glass so that all four glasses will have the same amount of juice.\nStep 3:  Let's assume that the amount of juice in each of the first three glasses is $x$. Therefore, the total amount of juice in the first three glasses is $3x$.\nStep 4:  Since the fourth glass is only $\\frac{1}{3}$ full, the amount of juice in it is $\\frac{1}{3}$ of a glass, which is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\nStep 5:  To make all four glasses have the same amount of juice, we need to distribute the juice from the first three glasses into the fourth glass in such a way that each glass has the same amount of juice.\nStep 6:  This means that the total amount of juice in all four glasses should be equal. So, we can set up the equation $3x + \\frac{1}{3} = 4x$ to represent this situation.\nStep 7:  Solving for $x$, we get $x = \\frac{1}{12}$.\nStep 8:  This means that each of the first three glasses should have $\\frac{1}{12}$ of a glass of juice poured into the fourth glass.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the fraction of a glass that Mrs. Jones must pour from each of the first three glasses into the fourth glass is $\\frac{1}{12}$.\nStep 10:  The final answer can be written in the form $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. In this case, $m=1$ and $n=12$, so $m+n=1+12=13$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{13}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first understand the given scenario. We have two circles, one with a radius of $4$ and the other with a radius of $10$. The center of the first circle lies on the positive $x$-axis and is tangent to the $y$-axis at the origin, while the center of the second circle lies on the positive $y$-axis and is tangent to the $x$-axis at the origin.\nStep 2:  We are asked to find the slope of the line passing through the two points at which these circles intersect.\nStep 3:  Let's denote the center of the smaller circle as $A$ and the center of the larger circle as $B$. We can then find the coordinates of these centers based on the given information.\nStep 4:  The center of the smaller circle, $A$, is located at $(4,0)$, and the center of the larger circle, $B$, is located at $(0,10)$.\nStep 5:  We can then find the points of intersection of the two circles by considering the equations of the circles and solving for the points of intersection.\nStep 6:  The equation of the smaller circle is $(x-4)^2 + y^2 = 16$, and the equation of the larger circle is $x^2 + (y-10)^2 = 100$.\nStep 7:  By solving these equations simultaneously, we can find the points of intersection, which we'll denote as $C$ and $D$.\nStep 8:  The line passing through points $C$ and $D$ will have a slope that we need to find.\nStep 9:  To find the slope of the line passing through points $C$ and $D$, we can use the formula for the slope of a line given two points: $\\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$.\nStep 10:  We can then simplify the expression to find the slope in the form $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.\nStep 11:  Finally, we can find the sum of $m$ and $n$ to obtain the final answer.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{11}$",
  "Step 1:  To find the maximum area of the isosceles trapezoid, we need to consider the properties of the trapezoid and how its dimensions affect its area.\nStep 2:  Let's denote the length of the shorter base as $x$. Since one base is twice as long as the other, the longer base will be $2x$.\nStep 3:  The height of the trapezoid can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, where the height is the leg of a right triangle with hypotenuse $1$ and base $\\frac{x}{2}$. This gives us the height as $\\sqrt{1-\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{1-\\frac{x^2}{4}}$.\nStep 4:  The area of the trapezoid can be calculated using the formula $A = \\frac{h}{2}(a+b)$, where $h$ is the height, and $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the two bases.\nStep 5:  Substituting the values we have, the area of the trapezoid is given by $A = \\frac{x}{2}\\left(2x+\\frac{x}{2}\\right)\\sqrt{1-\\frac{x^2}{4}} = \\frac{x^2}{2}\\left(2+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\sqrt{1-\\frac{x^2}{4}} = \\frac{3x^2}{4}\\sqrt{1-\\frac{x^2}{4}}$.\nStep 6:  To find the maximum area, we need to maximize the expression $\\frac{3x^2}{4}\\sqrt{1-\\frac{x^2}{4}}$.\nStep 7:  We can simplify this expression by letting $y = \\sqrt{1-\\frac{x^2}{4}}$, which transforms the expression into $\\frac{3x^2}{4}y$.\nStep 8:  We then need to find the maximum value of $\\frac{3x^2}{4}y$ by considering the relationship between $x$ and $y$.\nStep 9:  Since $y = \\sqrt{1-\\frac{x^2}{4}}$, we have $y^2 = 1-\\frac{x^2}{4}$, which gives us $x^2 = 4(1-y^2)$.\nStep 10:  Substituting this into the expression $\\frac{3x^2}{4}y$, we get $\\frac{3x^2}{4}y = 3y(1-y^2)$.\nStep 11:  To find the maximum value of $3y(1-y^2)$, we can use the AM-GM inequality, which states that the arithmetic mean of a set of non-negative numbers is greater than or equal to the geometric mean of the same set of numbers.\nStep 12:  Applying the AM-GM inequality to $3y(1-y^2)$, we get $3y(1-y^2) \\le \\left(\\frac{3y+(1-y^2)}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nStep 13:  Therefore, the maximum value of $3y(1-y^2)$ is $\\frac{1}{4}$.\nStep 14:  To find the corresponding value of $x$, we can substitute $y = \\frac{1}{2}$ into the equation $x^2 = 4(1-y^2)$, which gives us $x^2 = 4\\left(1-\\frac{1}{4}\\right) = 3$.\nStep 15:  Taking the square root of both sides, we get $x = \\sqrt{3}$.\nStep 16:  Now that we have the value of $x$, we can find the maximum area of the trapezoid by substituting $x = \\sqrt{3}$ into the expression for the area.\nStep 17:  This gives us the maximum area as $\\frac{3x^2}{4}\\sqrt{1-\\frac{x^2}{4}} = \\frac{3\\cdot 3}{4}\\sqrt{1-\\frac{3}{4}} = \\frac{9}{4}\\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{2} = \\frac{9\\sqrt{7}}{8}$.\nStep 18:  Therefore, the maximum area of the isosceles trapezoid is $\\frac{9\\sqrt{7}}{8}$.\nStep 19:  The final answer is: $\\boxed{94}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given binary operation $\\otimes$ and how it applies to complex numbers.\nStep 2:  We are given that $z\\otimes z = z^{2}+40$, and we need to find the value of $|z|^2$.\nStep 3:  Let's start by expressing $z$ as a complex number in the form $a+bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers and $i=\\sqrt{-1}$.\nStep 4:  Now, we can apply the binary operation $\\otimes$ to $z$ by squaring it, which gives us $z^{2} = (a+bi)^{2} = a^{2} + 2abi - b^{2}$.\nStep 5:  According to the given information, $z\\otimes z = z^{2}+40$, so we can equate the two expressions to get $ac + bdi = a^{2} + 2abi - b^{2} + 40$.\nStep 6:  By comparing the real and imaginary parts on both sides of the equation, we can derive two equations: $a^{2} - b^{2} + 40 = ac$ and $ab = -b^{2}$.\nStep 7:  From the second equation, we can factor out $b$ to get $ab = -b^{2} \\Rightarrow b(a+1) = 0$.\nStep 8:  This implies that either $b=0$ or $a=-1$.

This is because we are choosing $k-1$ elements from a set of $12-k$ elements.\nTherefore, the total number of subsets of size $k$ is $\\binom{12-k}{k-1}$.\nWe can sum up these counts for $k=1$ to $12$ to get the total number of subsets that satisfy the condition.\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sum_{k=1}^{12} \\binom{12-k}{k-1} &= \\binom{11}{0} + \\binom{10}{1} + \\binom{9}{2} + \\binom{8}{3} + \\binom{7}{4} + \\binom{6}{5} + \\binom{5}{6} + \\binom{4}{7} + \\binom{3}{8} + \\binom{2}{9} + \\binom{1}{10} + \\binom{0}{11} \\\\\n&= 1 + 10 + 36 + 56 + 35 + 6 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 \\\\\n&= 144\n\\end{align*}\nTherefore, the total number of subsets that satisfy the condition is $\\boxed{144}$.",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the given inequality and how it defines a region in the coordinate plane.\nStep 2:  The inequality $| | x | - 1 | + | | y | - 1 | \\le 1$ involves absolute values, which means the expression inside the absolute value can be either positive or negative.\nStep 3:  We can start by considering the cases when $x \\ge 0$ and $y \\ge 0$, which simplifies the inequality to $|x - 1| + |y - 1| \\le 1$.\nStep 4:  This inequality defines a region in the first quadrant of the coordinate plane. We can further break it down into cases based on the values of $x$ and $y$ to understand the boundaries of this region.\nStep 5:  When $x \\ge 1$ and $y \\ge 1$, the inequality becomes $x - 1 + y - 1 \\le 1$, which simplifies to $x + y \\le 3$. This defines a triangle in the first quadrant with vertices at $(0,0)$, $(3,0)$, and $(0,3)$.\nStep 6:  However, we need to consider the other cases as well, such as when $x < 1$ and $y < 1$, to ensure we capture the entire region defined by the inequality.\nStep 7:  By analyzing all the cases, we can determine the complete region defined by the inequality and calculate its area.\nStep 8:  The region defined by the inequality is a square with side length 2, centered at the origin. Therefore, the area of this region is $2^2 = 4$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$"
