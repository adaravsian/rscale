  "## Step 1: Recall Snell's law\nSnell's law states that the ratio of the sines of the angles of incidence and refraction is equal to the ratio of the velocities of the two media, or equivalently, the inverse ratio of the indices of refraction. Mathematically, this can be expressed as $n_1 \\sin{\\theta_1} = n_2 \\sin{\\theta_2}$, where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the indices of refraction of the first and second media, respectively, and $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$ are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.\n\n## Step 2: Apply Snell's law to the given problem\nIn this problem, the light is incident on the surface of the water at an angle $\\theta_w$ with respect to the surface normal.

To find the critical angle, we can rearrange this equation to isolate $\\sin{\\theta_w}$, which gives us $\\sin{\\theta_w} = \\frac{1}{1.3}$. To find the critical angle, we take the inverse sine of both sides, which gives us $\\theta_w = \\arcsin{\\frac{1}{1.3}}$.\n\n## Step 5: Write the final answer\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\arcsin{1.3 \\sin{\\theta_w}}}$",

We are asked to find a particular solution in the form $k_0\\left[f(k_1t) + g(k_2t)\\right]$, where $f, g$ are trigonometric functions, excluding homogeneous solutions.\n## Step 2:  To solve this problem, we first need to find the complementary solution, which is the solution to the homogeneous equation $\\dot{x}+2 x=0$. This is a first-order linear ODE, and its solution can be found using an integrating factor.\n## Step 3:  The integrating factor for the homogeneous equation is $e^{\\int 2 \\,dt} = e^{2t}$.

To do this, we substitute $y_{c x}(t)=A e^{it}$ into the equation $m \\ddot{x}+b \\dot{x}+k x=k y$.\nStep 5:  Substituting $y_{c x}(t)=A e^{it}$ into the equation, we get $m \\ddot{x}+b \\dot{x}+k x=k A e^{it}$.\nStep 6:  We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by $m$, giving us $\\ddot{x}+\\frac{b}{m} \\dot{x}+\\frac{k}{m} x=\\frac{k}{m} A e^{it}$.\nStep 7:  To solve for $x$, we need to find the transfer function of the system, which is given by $\\frac{X(s)}{Y(s)}=\\frac{k}{m s^2+b s+k}$.\nStep 8:  We can then substitute $s=i$ into the transfer function to find the system response to the complex exponential input $y_{c x}(t)=A e^{it}$.\nStep 9:  Substituting $s=i$ into the transfer function, we get $\\frac{X(i)}{A}=\\frac{k}{m (i)^2+b (i)+k}=\\frac{k}{m i^2+b i+k}=\\frac{k}{-m+b i+k}$.\nStep 10:  Simplifying this expression, we get $\\frac{X(i)}{A}=\\frac{k}{-m+b i+k}=\\frac{k}{(k-m)+b i}$.\nStep 11:  To find the system response $z_p(t)$, we need to take the inverse Laplace transform of $X(i)$.\nStep 12:  The inverse Laplace transform of $X(i)$ is given by $x(t)=\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\left\\{ \\frac{k}{(k-m)+b i} A e^{it} \\right\\}$.\nStep 13:  Using the properties of the Laplace transform, we can simplify this expression to $x(t)=\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\left\\{ \\frac{k}{(k-m)+b i} A e^{it} \\right\\}=\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\left\\{ \\frac{k A e^{it}}{(k-m)+b i} \\right\\}$.\nStep 14:  To find the inverse Laplace transform, we can use the formula for the inverse Laplace transform of a complex exponential, which is given by $\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{s-a} e^{at} \\right\\}=e^{at}$.\nStep 15:  Applying this formula to our expression, we get $x(t)=\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\left\\{ \\frac{k A e^{it}}{(k-m)+b i} \\right\\}=\\frac{k A e^{it}}{(k-m)+b i}$.\nStep 16:  Therefore, the system response $z_p(t)$ is given by $z_p(t)=\\frac{k A e^{it}}{(k-m)+b i}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{4 A e^{it}}{(-1)+3 i}}",

  "## Step 1:  The problem asks us to find a solution to the differential equation $\\ddot{x}+4 x=\\cos (2 t)$ using the Exponential Response Formula (ERF) with a complex replacement.\n## Step 2:  We start by assuming a solution of the form $x_{p}=e^{r t}$, where $r$ is a complex number. Substituting this into the differential equation, we get the characteristic equation $r^{2}+4=0$.\n## Step 3:  Solving the characteristic equation, we find that $r=\\pm 2 i$. Since the ERF assumes a complex replacement, we use the complex roots to find the solution.\n## Step 4:  The ERF states that a solution to $p(D) x=A e^{r t}$ is given by $x_{p}=A \\frac{e^{r t}}{p(r)}$, as long as $\\left.p (r)\\right. \\neq 0$. In this case, $p(r)=r^{2}+4$, so we have $x_{p}=A \\frac{e^{r t}}{r^{2}+4}$.\n## Step 5:  Substituting $r=\\pm 2 i$ into the solution, we get $x_{p}=A \\frac{e^{\\pm 2 i t}}{4+4}$.

Substituting this into the solution, we get $x_{p}=A \\frac{\\cos (2 t) \\pm i \\sin (2 t)}{8}$.\n## Step 7:  Since the differential equation is real, we take the real part of the solution, which gives us $x_{p}=A \\frac{\\cos (2 t)}{8}$.\n## Step 8:  To find the value of $A$, we use the initial condition $x(0)=0$. Substituting $t=0$ into the solution, we get $x_{p}(0)=A \\frac{\\cos (0)}{8}=A \\frac{1}{8}$.\n## Step 9:  Since $x(0)=0$, we have $A \\frac{1}{8}=0$, which implies that $A=0$. Therefore, the solution to the differential equation is $x_{p}=0$.\n## Step 10:  However, we are given that the solution is of the form $x_{p}=A \\frac{t e^{r t}}{p^{\\prime}(r)}$, where $p^{\\prime}(r)$ is the derivative of the characteristic equation.

This is a quadratic equation in $r$.\nStep 4:  Solving the characteristic equation, we get $r^2 = a^2$, which gives us two roots: $r = a$ and $r = -a$.\nStep 5:  Since the roots are real and distinct, the general solution to the ODE is given by $x(t) = c_1 e^{at} + c_2 e^{-at}$, where $c_1$ and $c_2$ are arbitrary constants.\nStep 6:  We are given the initial conditions $x(0) = 1$ and $\\dot{x}(0) = 0$. We can use these conditions to determine the values of $c_1$ and $c_2$.\nStep 7:  Substituting $t=0$ into the general solution, we get $x(0) = c_1 + c_2 = 1$.\nStep 8:  To find $\\dot{x}(0)$, we differentiate the general solution with respect to $t$ and then substitute $t=0$. This gives us $\\dot{x}(0) = ac_1 - ac_2 = 0$.\nStep 9:  Solving the system of equations $c_1 + c_2 = 1$ and $ac_1 - ac_2 = 0$, we find that $c_1 = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $c_2 = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the solution to the ODE that satisfies the given initial conditions is $x(t) = \\frac{1}{2} e^{at} + \\frac{1}{2} e^{-at}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2} e^{at} + \\frac{1}{2} e^{-at}}",

  "Step 1:  To find the wavelength of $\\lambda_{K_{\\alpha}}$ for molybdenum (Mo), we first need to understand what $\\lambda_{K_{\\alpha}}$ represents. It is the wavelength of the K-alpha X-ray line, which is emitted when an electron transitions from the L shell to the K shell in the atom.\nStep 2:  The energy of the K-alpha line can be calculated using the formula $E = 13.6 \\, \\text{eV} \\times Z^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{1^2} - \\frac{1}{n^2} \\right)$, where $Z$ is the atomic number of the element and $n$ is the principal quantum number of the shell from which the electron is transitioning.\nStep 3:  For molybdenum (Mo), the atomic number $Z$ is 42. The K-alpha line is emitted when an electron transitions from the L shell to the K shell, so $n = 2$.\nStep 4:  Substituting these values into the formula, we get $E = 13.6 \\, \\text{eV} \\times 42^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{1^2} - \\frac{1}{2^2} \\right)$.\nStep 5:  Simplifying this expression, we find $E = 13.6 \\, \\text{eV} \\times 1764 \\left( \\frac{1}{1} - \\frac{1}{4} \\right) = 13.6 \\, \\text{eV} \\times 1764 \\left( \\frac{3}{4} \\right)$.\nStep 6:  Continuing the calculation, we get $E = 13.6 \\, \\text{eV} \\times 1323 = 17973.8 \\, \\text{eV}$.\nStep 7:  To convert this energy from eV to Joules, we use the conversion factor $1 \\, \\text{eV} = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J}$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the energy of the K-alpha line in Joules is $E = 17973.8 \\, \\text{eV} \\times 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J/eV} = 2.883 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{J}$.\nStep 9:  Now, we can use the formula $\\lambda = \\frac{hc}{E}$ to find the wavelength of the K-alpha line, where $h$ is Planck's constant and $c$ is the speed of light.\nStep 10:  Substituting the values, we get $\\lambda = \\frac{6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{Js} \\times 3.00 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s}}{2.883 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{J}}$.\nStep 11:  Simplifying this expression, we find $\\lambda = \\frac{19.878 \\times 10^{-26} \\, \\text{Jm}}{2.883 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{J}} = 6.89 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{m}$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the wavelength of the K-alpha line for molybdenum is $6.89 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{m}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6.89 \\times 10^{-11}}",

  "The working temperature for silica glass is typically around 1000\u00b0C. This is because silica glass has a high melting point and can withstand high temperatures without deforming or losing its shape. However, it's worth noting that the exact working temperature can vary depending on the specific application and the type of silica glass being used. In general, silica glass is used in high-temperature applications such as furnace windows, heat exchangers, and refractory components. \n\n\\boxed{1000}",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to use the Bragg's law, which relates the wavelength of the electrons to the interplanar spacing of the crystal and the angle of diffraction.\nStep 2:  First, we need to find the interplanar spacing of the $\\{220\\}$ planes of gold. The interplanar spacing can be calculated using the formula $d_{hkl} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2}}$, where $a$ is the lattice constant of gold and $h, k, l$ are the Miller indices of the plane.\nStep 3:  The lattice constant of gold is $a = 4.078 \\times 10^{-10} \\mathrm{m}$.\nStep 4:  For the $\\{220\\}$ plane, $h = 2, k = 2, l = 0$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get $d_{220} = \\frac{4.078 \\times 10^{-10} \\mathrm{m}}{\\sqrt{2^2 + 2^2 + 0^2}} = \\frac{4.078 \\times 10^{-10} \\mathrm{m}}{2 \\sqrt{2}} = 1.44 \\times 10^{-10} \\mathrm{m}$.\nStep 5:  Next, we need to find the wavelength of the electrons. The wavelength of electrons can be calculated using the de Broglie equation, $\\lambda = \\frac{h}{p}$, where $h$ is the Planck constant and $p$ is the momentum of the electron.\nStep 6:  The momentum of the electron can be calculated using the formula $p = \\sqrt{2mE}$, where $m$ is the mass of the electron and $E$ is the kinetic energy of the electron.\nStep 7:  We are given that the angle of diffraction is $\\theta = 5^{\\circ}$, and we need to find the acceleration potential $V$ that must be applied to electrons to cause electron diffraction on the $\\{220\\}$ planes of gold at this angle.\nStep 8:  Using Bragg's law, we can relate the wavelength of the electrons to the interplanar spacing and the angle of diffraction: $2d \\sin \\theta = n \\lambda$.\nStep 9:  We can rearrange this equation to solve for the wavelength: $\\lambda = \\frac{2d \\sin \\theta}{n}$.\nStep 10:  Plugging in the values, we get $\\lambda = \\frac{2 \\times 1.44 \\times 10^{-10} \\mathrm{m} \\times \\sin 5^{\\circ}}{1} = 1.26 \\times 10^{-10} \\mathrm{m}$.\nStep 11:  Now, we can use the de Broglie equation to find the momentum of the electron: $p = \\frac{h}{\\lambda} = \\frac{6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{J s}}{1.26 \\times 10^{-10} \\mathrm{m}} = 5.25 \\times 10^{-24} \\mathrm{kg m/s}$.\nStep 12:  The kinetic energy of the electron is given by $E = \\frac{p^2}{2m}$.\nStep 13:  Plugging in the values, we get $E = \\frac{(5.25 \\times 10^{-24} \\mathrm{kg m/s})^2}{2 \\times 9.11 \\times 10^{-31} \\mathrm{kg}} = 1.45 \\times 10^{-17} \\mathrm{J}$.\nStep 14:  Finally, we can find the acceleration potential $V$ that must be applied to electrons to cause electron diffraction on the $\\{220\\}$ planes of gold at $\\theta = 5^{\\circ}$ by using the equation $E = eV$, where $e$ is the elementary charge.\nStep 15:  Plugging in the values, we get $V = \\frac{E}{e} = \\frac{1.45 \\times 10^{-17} \\mathrm{J}}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C}} = 90.5 \\mathrm{V}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{91}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to use the equation for diffusion, which is given by the error function (erf) or the complementary error function (erfc). However, since the surface concentration is constant, we can use the equation for the concentration profile in a semi-infinite solid with a constant surface concentration.\nStep 2:  The equation for the concentration profile is given by: $C(x, t) = C_{s} \\text{erfc}\\left(\\frac{x}{2\\sqrt{Dt}}\\right)$, where $C(x, t)$ is the concentration at depth $x$ and time $t$, $C_{s}$ is the surface concentration, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, and $t$ is the time.\nStep 3:  We are given that the surface concentration $C_{s}$ is $100\\%$, which is equivalent to $1$ in terms of concentration, and we want to find the time $t$ it takes to achieve a concentration of $1.8\\%$ at a depth of $0.002 \\mathrm{~cm}$.\nStep 4:  We can rearrange the equation to solve for $t$: $t = \\frac{x^{2}}{4D} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\text{erfc}^{-1}\\left(\\frac{C(x, t)}{C_{s}}\\right)}\\right)^{2}$.\nStep 5:  We can plug in the given values: $x = 0.002 \\mathrm{~cm}$, $D = 0.54 \\mathrm{~cm}^{2} / \\mathrm{s}$, and $C(x, t) = 0.018$.\nStep 6:  We can then calculate the time $t$ using the equation.\nStep 7:  After calculating, we get $t = 1.4 \\times 10^{5} \\mathrm{s}$.\nStep 8:  To convert this to days, we divide by $24 \\times 3600$, which gives us $t = 16.1 \\mathrm{days}$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, it will take approximately $16.1$ days to achieve a $\\mathrm{Cr}$ concentration of $1.8 \\%$ at a depth of $0.002 \\mathrm{~cm}$ below the steel surface.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{16.1}$",

  "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem asks us to find the activation energy of a process that increases by a factor of three when the temperature is increased from room temperature (20\u00b0C) to 40\u00b0C.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the Arrhenius equation\nThe Arrhenius equation is given by: k = Ae^(-Ea/RT), where k is the rate constant, A is the pre-exponential factor, Ea is the activation energy, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n## Step 3: Use the Arrhenius equation to relate the rate constants at the two temperatures\nWe can write two equations using the Arrhenius equation, one for each temperature: k1 = Ae^(-Ea/RT1) and k2 = Ae^(-Ea/RT2), where k1 and k2 are the rate constants at 20\u00b0C and 40\u00b0C, respectively.\n\n## Step 4: Divide the two equations to eliminate the pre-exponential factor A\nDividing the two equations, we get: k2/k1 = e^(-Ea/RT2) / e^(-Ea/RT1) = e^(-Ea/R(1/T2 - 1/T1)).\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the equation\nSimplifying the equation, we get: k2/k1 = e^(Ea*R/(T1*T2)*(1/T2 - 1/T1)).\n\n## Step 6: Take the natural logarithm of both sides\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get: ln(k2/k1) = Ea*R/(T1*T2)*(1/T2 - 1/T1).\n\n## Step 7: Plug in the values\nWe are given that k2/k1 = 3, T1 = 293 K (20\u00b0C), and T2 = 313 K (40\u00b0C). We can plug these values into the equation: ln(3) = Ea*R/(293*313)*(1/313 - 1/293).\n\n## Step 8: Simplify the equation\nSimplifying the equation, we get: ln(3) = Ea*R/(293*313)*(-1/(293*313)).\n\n## Step 9: Simplify further\nSimplifying further, we get: ln(3) = -Ea*R/(293*313*293*313).\n\n## Step 10: Solve for Ea\nSolving for Ea, we get: Ea = -ln(3)*293*313*293*313/R.\n\n## Step 11: Plug in the value of R\nWe know that R = 8.314 J/(mol*K). Plugging this value into the equation, we get: Ea = -ln(3)*293*313*293*313/8.314.\n\n## Step 12: Calculate the value of Ea\nEa = -5.703*293*313*293*313/8.314 = 62351.4 J/mol.\n\n## Step 13: Convert the value of Ea to kJ/mol\nEa = 62351.4 J/mol = 62.3514 kJ/mol.\n\n## Step 14: Round the value of Ea to 1 decimal place\nRounding the value of Ea to 1 decimal place, we get: Ea = 62.4 kJ/mol.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{62.4}$",

  "Step 1:  To find the differences in relative electronegativity, we first need to calculate the electronegativity of each element using the given bond energies.\nStep 2:  We can use the formula: $\\Delta x = \\frac{E_{A-B}}{0.5(E_{A-A} + E_{B-B})}$, where $E_{A-B}$ is the bond energy of the A-B bond, and $E_{A-A}$ and $E_{B-B}$ are the bond energies of the A-A and B-B bonds, respectively.\nStep 3:  First, let's calculate the electronegativity of hydrogen (H) using the bond energies of H2 and HF. $\\Delta x_{H} = \\frac{565}{0.5(436+172)} = \\frac{565}{154} = 3.67$\nStep 4:  Next, let's calculate the electronegativity of carbon (C) using the bond energies of C2 and CH. $\\Delta x_{C} = \\frac{410}{0.5(335+436)} = \\frac{410}{385.5} = 1.06$\nStep 5:  Now, let's calculate the electronegativity of fluorine (F) using the bond energies of F2 and HF. $\\Delta x_{F} = \\frac{565}{0.5(172+436)} = \\frac{565}{304} = 1.86$\nStep 6:  Finally, we can find the differences in relative electronegativity for the systems H-F and C-F by subtracting the electronegativity of the second element from the electronegativity of the first element. $\\Delta x_{H-F} = \\Delta x_{H} - \\Delta x_{F} = 3.67 - 1.86 = 1.81$ and $\\Delta x_{C-F} = \\Delta x_{C} - \\Delta x_{F} = 1.06 - 1.86 = -0.80$\nStep 7:  Therefore, the differences in relative electronegativity for the systems H-F and C-F are 1.81 eV and -0.80 eV, respectively.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1.81}$",
  "Step 1:  To find the density of electron-hole pairs in intrinsic germanium at a temperature of $20^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, we first need to understand the given equation for the number of electron-hole pairs, $n_{i}$.\nStep 2:  The equation provided is $n_{i}=9.7 \\times 10^{15} \\mathrm{~T}^{3 / 2} \\mathrm{e}^{-\\mathrm{E}_{g} / 2 \\mathrm{KT}}\\left[\\mathrm{cm}^{3}\\right]$, where $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin, $E_{g}$ is the bandgap energy, and $K$ is the Boltzmann constant.\nStep 3:  We are given that the bandgap energy $E_{g}=0.72 \\mathrm{eV}$ and we need to find the density of pairs at $T=20^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, which is equivalent to $293 \\mathrm{~K}$.\nStep 4:  First, we need to convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin. The temperature in Kelvin is given by $T(\\mathrm{K})=T(\\mathrm{C})+273.15$. Therefore, $T=20^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}+273.15=293.15 \\mathrm{~K}$.\nStep 5:  Next, we need to calculate the value of $e^{-E_{g} / 2KT}$. The bandgap energy $E_{g}$ is given in electronvolts (eV), so we need to convert it to Joules by multiplying by the elementary charge $e$. Therefore, $E_{g}=0.72 \\mathrm{eV} \\times 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{J/eV}=1.155 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{J}$.\nStep 6:  Now, we can calculate the value of $e^{-E_{g} / 2KT}$.

Plugging in the values, we get $n_{i}=9.7 \\times 10^{15} \\times 293.15^{3 / 2} \\times 0.973=9.7 \\times 10^{15} \\times 1.73 \\times 10^{4} \\times 0.973=1.63 \\times 10^{20}$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the density of electron-hole pairs in intrinsic germanium at $T=20^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ is $1.63 \\times 10^{20}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1.63 \\times 10^{20}}",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to use the relationship between the speed of light, wavelength, and frequency of light.\nStep 2:  The first relationship we need to use is $v \\lambda = c$, where $v$ is the frequency, $\\lambda$ is the wavelength, and $c$ is the speed of light.\nStep 3:  We are given the wavelength $\\lambda = 408 \\mathrm{~nm}$ and the speed of light $c = 3 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{~m/s}$.\nStep 4:  We can rearrange the equation to solve for frequency: $v = \\frac{c}{\\lambda}$.\nStep 5:  Plugging in the given values, we get $v = \\frac{3 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{~m/s}}{408 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{~m}}$.\nStep 6:  Simplifying this expression, we get $v = 7.353 \\times 10^{14} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the frequency of the light is $7.353 \\times 10^{14} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$.\n\nNow, let's move on to the second part of the problem, which is to find the wave number in $m^{-1}$.\n\nStep 8:  The wave number is given by the equation $k = \\frac{2 \\pi}{\\lambda}$.\nStep 9:  We are given the wavelength $\\lambda = 408 \\mathrm{~nm}$.\nStep 10:  Plugging in the value of $\\lambda$, we get $k = \\frac{2 \\pi}{408 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{~m}}$.\nStep 11:  Simplifying this expression, we get $k = 4.79 \\times 10^{6} \\mathrm{~m}^{-1}$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the wave number of the light is $4.79 \\times 10^{6} \\mathrm{~m}^{-1}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4.79e6}$",
  "Step 1: First, let's identify the given information and what we need to find. We are given the molarity of NaI as 0.25 M and the volume of Hg(NO3)2 as 45 mL with a molarity of 0.10 M. We need to find the volume of NaI required to precipitate all the Hg2+ ions.\n\nStep 2: To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of stoichiometry and the molarity formula. We will first calculate the number of moles of Hg2+ ions present in the 45 mL of Hg(NO3)2 solution.\n\nStep 3: The molarity formula is M = moles/L. We can rearrange this formula to find the number of moles: moles = M * L. We know the molarity of Hg(NO3)2 is 0.10 M and the volume is 45 mL, which is 0.045 L. So, the number of moles of Hg2+ ions is 0.10 M * 0.045 L = 0.0045 mol.\n\nStep 4: Next, we need to find the number of moles of NaI required to precipitate all the Hg2+ ions. From the balanced equation, we can see that 2 moles of NaI are required to precipitate 1 mole of Hg2+. Therefore, the number of moles of NaI required is 2 * 0.0045 mol = 0.009 mol.\n\nStep 5: Now, we need to find the volume of NaI required to provide 0.009 mol of NaI. We can use the molarity formula again: M = moles/L. We know the number of moles of NaI required is 0.009 mol and we need to find the volume in liters. Rearranging the formula, we get L = moles/M. Plugging in the values, we get L = 0.009 mol / 0.25 M = 0.036 L.\n\nStep 6: Finally, we need to convert the volume from liters to milliliters. There are 1000 mL in 1 L, so the volume of NaI required is 0.036 L * 1000 mL/L = 36 mL.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{36}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to apply the concept of diffusion and use the formula for the concentration of a diffusing substance as a function of time and position.\nStep 2:  The concentration of helium in the glass at any point and time can be described by the equation $C(x, t)=C_{0} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot\\left\\{1-\\mathrm{erf}\\left(\\frac{x}{2 \\sqrt{Dt}}\\right)\\right\\}$, where $C_{0}$ is the initial concentration, $x$ is the distance from the surface, $t$ is the time, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, and $\\mathrm{erf}$ is the error function.\nStep 3:  We are given that the concentration of helium has decreased to $1 / 3$ of its initial value after 10 minutes in vacuum at $400^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. This means that $C(x, t)=\\frac{1}{3} C_{0}$.\nStep 4:  We can substitute the given values into the equation and solve for $x$ to find the depth at which the concentration has decreased to $1 / 3$ of its initial value.\nStep 5:  The diffusion coefficient $D$ is given as $3.091 \\times 10^{-6} \\mathrm{~cm}^{2} / \\mathrm{s}$, and the time $t$ is 10 minutes, which is equivalent to $600 \\mathrm{~s}$.\nStep 6:  Substituting these values into the equation, we get $\\frac{1}{3}=\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot\\left\\{1-\\mathrm{erf}\\left(\\frac{x}{2 \\sqrt{3.091 \\times 10^{-6} \\mathrm{~cm}^{2} / \\mathrm{s} \\cdot 600 \\mathrm{~s}}}\\right)\\right\\}$.\nStep 7:  Solving for $x$, we find that $x=0.012 \\mathrm{~cm}$.\nStep 8:  To convert this to micrometers, we multiply by $10^{4}$, giving us $x=120 \\mu \\mathrm{m}$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the depth at which the concentration of helium has decreased to $1 / 3$ of its initial value is $120 \\mu \\mathrm{m}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{120}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the concept of solubility product, $\\mathrm{K}_{\\mathrm{sp}}$, and how it relates to the dissolution of $\\mathrm{Bi}_{2} \\mathrm{~S}_{3}$ in water.\nStep 2:  The given reaction is $\\mathrm{Bi}_{2} \\mathrm{~S}_{3}(\\mathrm{~s}) \\Leftrightarrow 2 \\mathrm{Bi}^{3+}(\\mathrm{aq})+3 \\mathrm{~s}^{2-}(\\mathrm{aq})$, and the solubility product, $\\mathrm{K}_{\\mathrm{sp}}$, is given as $1.6 \\times 10^{-72}$ at room temperature.\nStep 3:  The solubility product is a measure of the equilibrium between a solid ionic compound and its ions in a solution. It is defined as the product of the concentrations of the ions in the solution, each raised to the power of its stoichiometric coefficient in the balanced equation.\nStep 4:  In this case, the solubility product expression for $\\mathrm{Bi}_{2} \\mathrm{~S}_{3}$ is $[\\mathrm{Bi}^{3+}]^{2}[\\mathrm{S}^{2-}]^{3} = 1.6 \\times 10^{-72}$.\nStep 5:  We are asked to find the number of moles of $\\mathrm{Bi}_{2} \\mathrm{~S}_{3}$ that will dissolve in $3.091 \\times 10^{6}$ liters of water at room temperature.\nStep 6:  To do this, we need to first determine the concentrations of $\\mathrm{Bi}^{3+}$ and $\\mathrm{S}^{2-}$ ions in the solution.\nStep 7:  Let's assume that $x$ moles of $\\mathrm{Bi}_{2} \\mathrm{~S}_{3}$ dissolve in the given volume of water. This means that $2x$ moles of $\\mathrm{Bi}^{3+}$ and $3x$ moles of $\\mathrm{S}^{2-}$ will be produced.\nStep 8:  The concentration of $\\mathrm{Bi}^{3+}$ ions will be $\\frac{2x}{3.091 \\times 10^{6}}$ M, and the concentration of $\\mathrm{S}^{2-}$ ions will be $\\frac{3x}{3.091 \\times 10^{6}}$ M.\nStep 9:  We can then use the solubility product expression to set up an equation and solve for $x$, which represents the number of moles of $\\mathrm{Bi}_{2} \\mathrm{~S}_{3}$ that will dissolve in the given volume of water.\nStep 10:  Once we have the value of $x$, we can express it in the required format as $n \\times 10^x$ where $n$ is to 1 decimal place.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1.0 \\times 10^{-13}}",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of half-life and how it relates to the decay of radioactive isotopes.\nStep 2:  The half-life of a radioactive isotope is the time it takes for half of the initial amount of the isotope to decay. In this case, the half-life of tritium ($^{3}H$) is given as 12.5 years.\nStep 3:  We are told that the activity of the whiskey is 6% of that encountered in fresh bourbon. This means that the amount of tritium remaining in the whiskey is 6% of the original amount.\nStep 4:  We can use the concept of half-life to determine the age of the whiskey. Since the amount of tritium remaining is 6% of the original amount, we can set up an equation to represent this situation.\nStep 5:  Let's assume the original amount of tritium is $A_0$. After one half-life, the amount remaining is $A_0/2$. After two half-lives, the amount remaining is $A_0/4$, and so on.\nStep 6:  We can use the formula for exponential decay, which is $A = A_0 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n$, where $A$ is the amount remaining, $A_0$ is the original amount, and $n$ is the number of half-lives.\nStep 7:  In this case, we know that the amount remaining is 6% of the original amount, so we can set up the equation $0.06 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n$.\nStep 8:  To solve for $n$, we can take the logarithm of both sides of the equation. Using logarithms, we can rewrite the equation as $\\log(0.06) = n \\log\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$.\nStep 9:  Solving for $n$, we get $n = \\frac{\\log(0.06)}{\\log\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)}$.\nStep 10:  Plugging in the values, we find that $n \\approx 4.38$.\nStep 11:  Since the half-life of tritium is 12.5 years, we can multiply the number of half-lives by the half-life to find the age of the whiskey: $4.38 \\times 12.5 \\approx 54.75$ years.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the age of the whiskey is approximately 54.75 years.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{54.75}$",

  "## Step 1: Determine the rate constant at 750\u00b0C\nTo find the rate constant (k) at 750\u00b0C, we use the Arrhenius equation: k = Ae^(-EA/RT), where A is the pre-exponential factor, EA is the activation energy, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n## Step 2: Convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin\nFirst, we need to convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin: T = 750\u00b0C + 273.15 = 1023.15 K.\n\n## Step 3: Plug in the values into the Arrhenius equation\nNow, we plug in the values into the Arrhenius equation: k = 1.7 \u00d7 10^14 \u00d7 e^(-2.5 \u00d7 10^5 / (8.31 \u00d7 10^2 \u00d7 1023.15)).\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the rate constant\nUsing a calculator, we find that k \u2248 28.8 s^(-1).\n\n## Step 5: Determine the rate constant at 600\u00b0C\nTo find the rate constant (k) at 600\u00b0C, we use the Arrhenius equation again: k = Ae^(-EA/RT), where A is the pre-exponential factor, EA is the activation energy, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\n## Step 6: Convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin\nFirst, we need to convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin: T = 600\u00b0C + 273.15 = 873.15 K.\n\n## Step 7: Plug in the values into the Arrhenius equation\nNow, we plug in the values into the Arrhenius equation: k = 1.7 \u00d7 10^14 \u00d7 e^(-2.5 \u00d7 10^5 / (8.31 \u00d7 10^2 \u00d7 873.15)).\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the rate constant\nUsing a calculator, we find that k \u2248 0.035 s^(-1).\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the fraction of the reaction completed\nThe fraction of the reaction completed in 10 minutes (600 seconds) at 600\u00b0C is given by the integral of the rate constant over time, but since the rate constant is approximately constant over this short time period, we can use the formula: fraction completed = 1 - e^(-kt), where k is the rate constant at 600\u00b0C and t is the time in seconds.\n\n## Step 10: Plug in the values into the formula\nNow, we plug in the values into the formula: fraction completed = 1 - e^(-0.035 \u00d7 600).\n\n## Step 11: Calculate the fraction completed\nUsing a calculator, we find that fraction completed \u2248 1 - e^(-21)

Since one mole of $\\mathrm{SrF}_{2}$ produces one mole of $\\mathrm{Sr}^{2+}$ ions and two moles of $\\mathrm{F}^{-}$ ions, the concentration of $\\mathrm{Sr}^{2+}$ ions will be equal to the solubility $S$, and the concentration of $\\mathrm{F}^{-}$ ions will be twice the solubility, or $2S$.\nStep 7:  Substituting these concentrations into the $\\mathrm{K}_{\\mathrm{sp}}$ expression, we get: $2.45 \\times 10^{-9} = S(2S)^{2}$\nStep 8:  Simplifying this equation, we get: $2.45 \\times 10^{-9} = 4S^{3}$\nStep 9:  Solving for $S$, we find: $S^{3} = \\frac{2.45 \\times 10^{-9}}{4} = 6.125 \\times 10^{-10}$\nStep 10:  Taking the cube root of both sides, we get: $S = \\sqrt[3]{6.125 \\times 10^{-10}} = 1.58 \\times 10^{-3}$\nStep 11:  Therefore, the solubility of $\\mathrm{SrF}_{2}$ in water is $1.58 \\times 10^{-3}$ M.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1.58 \\times 10^{-3}}",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to use the equation for diffusion, which is given by $C(x, t)=C_{s}\\left[1-\\operatorname{erf}\\left(\\frac{x}{2 \\sqrt{Dt}}\\right)\\right]$ where $C(x, t)$ is the concentration of the dopant at a depth $x$ and time $t$, $C_{s}$ is the surface concentration, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, and $\\operatorname{erf}$ is the error function.\nStep 2:  We are given that the surface concentration $C_{s}=5 \\times 10^{16}$ atoms/ $\\mathrm{cm}^{3}$, the depth $x=25 \\mu \\mathrm{m}$, and the time $t=90$ minutes. We need to find the effective concentration of boron, which is the concentration at the surface after a certain time.\nStep 3:  First, we need to convert the time from minutes to seconds because the diffusion coefficient is given in $\\mathrm{cm}^{2} / \\mathrm{s}$. So, $t=90$ minutes $=90 \\times 60=5400$ seconds.\nStep 4:  Next, we need to convert the depth from micrometers to centimeters. So, $x=25 \\mu \\mathrm{m}=25 \\times 10^{-4} \\mathrm{~cm}$.\nStep 5:  Now, we can use the equation for diffusion to find the effective concentration of boron at the surface. We have $C(0, t)=C_{s}\\left[1-\\operatorname{erf}\\left(\\frac{x}{2 \\sqrt{Dt}}\\right)\\right]$.\nStep 6:  Plugging in the values, we get $C(0, t)=5 \\times 10^{16}\\left[1-\\operatorname{erf}\\left(\\frac{25 \\times 10^{-4}}{2 \\sqrt{7.23 \\times 10^{-9} \\times 5400}}\\right)\\right]$.\nStep 7:  Simplifying, we get $C(0, t)=5 \\times 10^{16}\\left[1-\\operatorname{erf}\\left(\\frac{25 \\times 10^{-4}}{2 \\sqrt{39.126}}\\right)\\right]$.\nStep 8:  Further simplifying, we get $C(0, t)=5 \\times 10^{16}\\left[1-\\operatorname{erf}\\left(\\frac{25 \\times 10^{-4}}{6.26}\\right)\\right]$.\nStep 9:  Evaluating the error function, we get $C(0, t)=5 \\times 10^{16}\\left[1-\\operatorname{erf}\\left(4 \\times 10^{-3}\\right)\\right]$.\nStep 10:  Using a calculator to evaluate the error function, we get $C(0, t)=5 \\times 10^{16}\\left[1-0.0062\\right]$.\nStep 11:  Simplifying, we get $C(0, t)=5 \\times 10^{16} \\times 0.9938$.\nStep 12:  Evaluating, we get $C(0, t)=4.969 \\times 10^{16}$.\nStep 13:  Rounding to 4 decimal places, we get $C(0, t)=4.9690 \\times 10^{16}$.\nStep 14:  Therefore, the effective concentration of boron at the surface is $4.9690 \\times 10^{16}$ atoms/ $\\mathrm{cm}^{3}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4.9690 \\times 10^{16}}",

The mass of an electron is approximately $9.11 \\times 10^{-31} \\mathrm{~kg}$.\nStep 5:  Now, we can substitute the given velocity and the mass of the electron into the formula to calculate the energy of the incident electron beam.\nStep 6:  Plugging in the values, we get $E = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 9.11 \\times 10^{-31} \\mathrm{~kg} \\times (4.4 \\times 10^{5} \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s})^{2}$.\nStep 7:  Simplifying this expression, we find that $E = 1.98 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{~J}$.\nStep 8:  To express this energy in electronvolts (eV), we use the conversion factor $1 \\mathrm{~eV} = 1.6 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{~J}$.\nStep 9:  Dividing the energy in joules by this conversion factor, we get $E = \\frac{1.98 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{~J}}{1.6 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{~J} / \\mathrm{eV}} = 1.2375 \\mathrm{~eV}$.\nStep 10:  Rounding this value to the nearest integer, we find that the energy of the incident electron beam is approximately $\\boxed{1}$ eV.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

  "Step 1: The marginal rate of substitution (MRS) of software for clothes is the rate at which a consumer is willing to trade off one good for another while remaining indifferent to the exchange. In this case, we want to find the MRS of software (S) for clothes (C).\n\nStep 2: To find the MRS, we need to find the partial derivatives of the utility function with respect to S and C. The partial derivative of U with respect to S is \u2202U/\u2202S = 4/S, and the partial derivative of U with respect to C is \u2202U/\u2202C = 6/C.\n\nStep 3: The MRS of software for clothes is given by the ratio of the partial derivative of U with respect to C to the partial derivative of U with respect to S. So, MRS = (\u2202U/\u2202C) / (\u2202U/\u2202S) = (6/C) / (4/S).\n\nStep 4: Simplify the expression for MRS.

  "Step 1:  To find the equilibrium quantity in the apple juice market, we need to solve the system of equations given by the supply and demand curves.\nStep 2:  The supply curve is represented by the equation $Q_{S} = 10P_{J} - 5P_{A}$, where $Q_{S}$ is the quantity supplied, $P_{J}$ is the price of apple juice, and $P_{A}$ is the price of apples, which is fixed at $\\$ 1$.\nStep 3:  The demand curve is represented by the equation $Q_{D} = 100 - 15P_{J} + 10P_{T}$, where $Q_{D}$ is the quantity demanded, $P_{J}$ is the price of apple juice, and $P_{T}$ is the price of tea, which is fixed at $\\$ 5$.\nStep 4:  We are given that $P_{A}$ is fixed at $\\$ 1$ and $P_{T}=5$.

  "Step 1: The marginal rate of technical substitution (MRTS) of labor for capital is the rate at which a firm can substitute labor for capital without changing the level of output. It is calculated as the ratio of the marginal product of labor (MPL) to the marginal product of capital (MPK).\n\nStep 2: To find the MRTS of labor for capital, we need to first find the marginal products of labor and capital. The marginal product of labor (MPL) is the partial derivative of the production function with respect to labor (L), and the marginal product of capital (MPK) is the partial derivative of the production function with respect to capital (K).\n\nStep 3: The production function is given as $F(K, L)=(K-1)^{\\frac{1}{4}} L^{\\frac{1}{4}}$. To find the marginal product of labor, we take the partial derivative of the production function with respect to labor (L). Using the power rule for partial derivatives, we get $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial L} = \\frac{1}{4} (K-1)^{\\frac{1}{4}} L^{-\\frac{3}{4}}$.\n\nStep 4: Similarly, to find the marginal product of capital, we take the partial derivative of the production function with respect to capital (K).

  "The condition which involves the SRAC is that the SRAC is at a minimum. This is the condition that the firm is at a capital level that minimizes its costs in the long-term. The SRAC is at a minimum when the marginal cost (MC) is equal to the average variable cost (AVC). This is because the SRAC is the sum of the AVC and the fixed cost (FC), and when the MC is equal to the AVC, the SRAC is at its minimum. Therefore, the condition that involves the SRAC is that the SRAC is at a minimum, which is represented by the equation MC = AVC. \\boxed{0}",

  "## Step 1: To find the short run industry supply function for widgets, we first need to understand the behavior of a single competitive firm in the industry.\nEach firm is assumed to be identical and faces the same cost function \\(c_{s}(y) = \\frac{1}{3}y^{3} + 2\\), where \\(y\\) is the output of the firm.\n\n## Step 2: The profit of a firm is given by the difference between its revenue and cost.\nThe revenue of a firm is given by the price of the widget times the quantity sold, which can be expressed as \\(p \\cdot y^{d}(p)\\), where \\(y^{d}(p)\\) is the demand function for widgets given by \\(y^{d}(p) = 6400 / p^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\).\n\n## Step 3: To find the profit-maximizing output for a single firm, we need to take the derivative of the profit function with respect to output and set it equal to zero.\nHowever, since the profit function is not explicitly given, we can infer that the firm will produce where the marginal revenue equals the marginal cost.\n\n## Step 4: The marginal revenue (MR) is the derivative of the revenue function with respect to output, and the marginal cost (MC) is the derivative of the cost function with respect to output.\nGiven the cost function \\(c_{s}(y) = \\frac{1}{3}y^{3} + 2\\), the marginal cost is \\(\\frac{d}{dy}(\\frac{1}{3}y^{3} + 2) = y^{2}\\).\n\n## Step 5: The revenue function can be found by substituting the demand function into the revenue equation: \\(R(y) = p \\cdot y^{d}(p) = p \\cdot (6400 / p^{\\frac{1}{2}})\\).\nSimplifying this expression gives \\(R(y) = 6400 \\cdot p^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\).\n\n## Step 6: To find the marginal revenue, we take the derivative of the revenue function with respect to output, but since the revenue function is actually a function of price, we need to express it in terms of output.\nHowever, given the complexity of directly differentiating the revenue function with respect to output, we can infer that the marginal revenue function will be related to the demand function and its derivative.\n\n## Step 7: The demand function is \\(y^{d}(p) = 6400 / p^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\), and its inverse, which relates output to price, is \\(p(y) = (6400 / y)^{2}\\).\nThe derivative of the demand function with respect to price, which is the inverse of the marginal revenue function, is \\(\\frac{dy^{d}}{dp} = -\\frac{1}{2}p^{-\\frac{3}{2}}\\).\n\n## Step 8: The marginal revenue function (MR) is the derivative of the revenue function with respect to output, but since we are working with a demand function that is a function of price, we can use the inverse demand function to relate MR to the derivative of the demand function with respect to price.\nHowever, the direct relationship between MR and the derivative of the demand function is not straightforward without considering the inverse demand function's derivative.\n\n## Step 9: To find the short run industry supply function, we need to consider the behavior of the firms in the industry as a whole.\nThe industry supply function is the sum of the supply functions of all firms in the industry.\n\n## Step 10: Since each firm is identical and faces the same cost and demand conditions, the industry supply function can be found by considering the profit-maximizing output of a single firm and then summing these outputs across all firms.\nHowever, the direct calculation of the industry supply function from the given information requires a more nuanced approach that considers the relationship between the marginal cost and the marginal revenue at the industry level.\n\n## Step 11: The industry supply

  "Step 1:  To find the equilibrium price in the apple juice market, we need to first understand the given supply and demand curves. The supply curve is represented by the equation $Q_{S} = 10P_{J} - 5P_{A}$, where $Q_{S}$ is the quantity supplied, $P_{J}$ is the price of apple juice, and $P_{A}$ is the price of apples. We are given that $P_{A}$ is fixed at $\\$ 1$. The demand curve is represented by the equation $Q_{D} = 100 - 15P_{J} + 10P_{T}$, where $Q_{D}$ is the quantity demanded, $P_{J}$ is the price of apple juice, and $P_{T}$ is the price of tea, which is given as $\\$ 5$.\nStep 2:  We are asked to find the equilibrium price in the apple juice market, which occurs when the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded. This can be represented by the equation $Q_{S} = Q_{D}$.\nStep 3:  Substituting the given values into the supply and demand equations, we get $Q_{S} = 10P_{J} - 5(1) = 10P_{J} - 5$ and $Q_{D} = 100 - 15P_{J} + 10(5) = 100 - 15P_{J} + 50 = 150 - 15P_{J}$.\nStep 4:  Setting $Q_{S} = Q_{D}$, we have $10P_{J} - 5 = 150 - 15P_{J}$.\nStep 5:  Solving for $P_{J}$, we get $10P_{J} + 15P_{J} = 150 + 5$, which simplifies to $25P_{J} = 155$.\nStep 6:  Dividing both sides by $25$, we find that $P_{J} = \\frac{155}{25} = 6.2$.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the equilibrium price in the apple juice market is $\\$ 6.20$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6.2}$",

This information gives us a starting point to work with.\nStep 4:  Let's denote the price at which the city should set the price of apples as $p$ cents. We can then use the given information to set up an equation to solve for $p$.\nStep 5:  The demand for apples is given by the equation $150 = 50 + (p - 75) \\cdot D$, where $D$ represents the demand for apples.\nStep 6:  We can rearrange this equation to solve for $D$, which gives us $D = \\frac{100}{p - 75}$.\nStep 7:  The total cost of producing and purchasing the apples is given by the equation $TC = 25 \\cdot 50 + 75 \\cdot D$.\nStep 8:  Substituting the expression for $D$ into the equation for $TC$, we get $TC = 1250 + 75 \\cdot \\frac{100}{p - 75}$.\nStep 9:  To minimize the total cost, we need to find the value of $p$ that minimizes $TC$.\nStep 10:  Taking the derivative of $TC$ with respect to $p$ and setting it equal to zero, we get $\\frac{d(TC)}{dp} = -\\frac{7500}{(p - 75)^2} = 0$.\nStep 11:  Solving for $p$, we find that $p = 75$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the city of Cambridge should set the price of apples at $\\boxed{75}$ cents.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{75}$",

The MC is the cost of producing one additional unit of output, while the ATC is the total cost divided by the number of units produced.\nStep 3:  We are also told that the market price of a can of peanut butter is $\\$10$.\nStep 4:  The first option is to pay a lump sum equal to the profits, and the second option is to impose a tax of $\\$\\left[P-A T C\\left(q^{*}\\right)\\right]$ per can, where $q^{*}$ is the profit-maximizing output before the lawsuit.\nStep 5:  We need to determine the tax amount in dollars per can, which is the difference between the market price and the ATC at the profit-maximizing output level.\nStep 6:  To find the profit-maximizing output, we need to compare the MC and ATC at the two given output levels. Since MC(4) = 4 and ATC(4) = 4, it indicates that the firm is already producing at the lowest point of the ATC curve, which means that the profit-maximizing output is 4.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the tax amount is the difference between the market price and the ATC at the profit-maximizing output level, which is $\\$10 - \\$4 = \\$6$ per can.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$",
