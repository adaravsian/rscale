  "Step 1: Understand the problem and the rules of the game. Xenia thinks of a positive integer $N$ not exceeding 5000 and fixes 20 distinct positive integers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{20}$ such that, for each $k=1,2, \\ldots, 20$, the numbers $N$ and $a_{k}$ are congruent modulo $k$. Sergey's goal is to determine the number $N$ by asking Xenia for the values of the $a_k$ for a set of positive integers not exceeding 20.\n\nStep 2:  To solve this problem, we need to consider the minimum number of moves Sergey needs to make to determine the number $N$.\nStep 3:  We can start by analyzing the possible values of $N$ modulo 20.

We are given a rectangular board with $m$ rows and $2n$ columns, and we want to place the maximum number of dominoes on it.\n## Step 2:  Each domino covers exactly two adjacent cells, and no two dominoes can overlap or form a $2 \\times 2$ square.

Since each domino covers two adjacent cells, we can place $n$ dominoes in the bottom row, covering $2n$ cells.\n## Step 4:  Now, we need to consider the placement of dominoes in the remaining rows. We can place dominoes in the first and second columns, and then move to the third and fourth columns, and so on.\n## Step 5:  In each pair of columns, we can place at most one domino. This is because if we place two dominoes in the same pair of columns, they would form a $2 \\times 2$ square, which is not allowed.\n## Step 6:  Since we have $n$ pairs of columns, we can place at most $n$ dominoes in the first and second columns, $n$ dominoes in the third and fourth columns, and so on.\n## Step 7:  However, we need to consider the number of rows. If $m$ is even, we can place dominoes in all the pairs of columns, and we can place at most $n$ dominoes in each pair of columns.\n## Step 8:  If $m$ is odd, we can place dominoes in all the pairs of columns except the last pair, and we can place at most $n$ dominoes in each pair of columns.\n## Step 9:  Therefore, the maximum number of dominoes that can be placed on the board is $n$ if $m$ is even, and $n(m-1)/2$ if $m$ is odd.\n## Step 10:  However, we need to consider the case where $m$ is odd and $n$ is even. In this case, we can place dominoes in all the pairs of columns, and we can place at most $n$ dominoes in each pair of columns.\n## Step 11:  Therefore, the maximum number of dominoes that can be placed on the board is $n$ if $m$ is even, $n(m-1)/2$ if $m$ is odd and $n$ is even, and $n(m-1)/2 + 1$ if $m$ is odd and $n$ is odd.\n## Step 12:  However, we can simplify this further.

  "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are given a set $S$ of points in 3D space, where each point is defined by three coordinates $x, y, z$ that can take values from $0$ to $n$, and the condition is that the sum of these coordinates must be greater than $0$. We need to find the smallest number of planes that can contain all the points of $S$ except the origin.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the total number of points in S\nThe set $S$ contains all points with coordinates $(x, y, z)$ where $x, y, z \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, n\\}$ and $x+y+z>0$. Since each coordinate can take $n+1$ values, the total number of points in $S$ is $(n+1)^3 - 1$, because we exclude the point where all coordinates are $0$.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the planes that contain the points of S\nTo contain all points of $S$ except the origin, each plane must have at least one point from $S$ on it. Since the points in $S$ are defined by the condition $x+y+z>0$, any plane that contains a point from $S$ must have a normal vector that is not parallel to the $x$, $y$, or $z$ axes.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the minimum number of planes required\nTo find the smallest number of planes that can contain all points of $S$ except the origin, we need to consider the structure of the set $S$. The points in $S$ form a pyramid with a base of $(n+1)^2$ points and a height of $n$. The apex of the pyramid is the point $(n, n, n)$.\n\n## Step 5: Find the minimum number of planes required to cover the pyramid\nTo cover the entire pyramid, we need to find the minimum number of planes that can intersect the pyramid and contain all its points except the origin. Since the pyramid has a base of $(n+1)^2$ points, we need at least $(n+1)^2$ planes to cover the base. However, we also need to consider the height of the pyramid, which is $n$. To cover the height, we need at least $n$ planes that intersect the pyramid and contain all its points except the origin.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the minimum number of planes required\nSince we need at least $(n+1)^2$ planes to cover the base and $n$ planes to cover the height, the minimum number of planes required to cover the entire pyramid is $(n+1)^2 + n$.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the expression\nWe can simplify the expression $(n+1)^2 + n$ by expanding the square and combining like terms: $(n+1)^2 + n = n^2 + 2n + 1 + n = n^2 + 3n + 1$.\n\n## Step 8: Write the final answer\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{n^2 + 3n + 1}$",

This means that $t(k)$ will always be an odd number.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the possible values of t(n+a) and t(n)\nSince $t(k)$ is the largest odd divisor of $k$, we can conclude that $t(n+a)$ and $t(n)$ are both odd numbers.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the differences t(n+a)-t(n) and t(n+a+1)-t(n+1)\nThe difference $t(n+a)-t(n)$ will be an even number, since both $t(n+a)$ and $t(n)$ are odd numbers. Similarly, the difference $t(n+a+1)-t(n+1)$ will also be an even number.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the condition for the differences to be divisible by 4\nFor the differences to be divisible by 4, they must be multiples of 4.

  "## Step 1: Understand the constraints of the problem\nWe have a 100x100 chessboard and need to place 2500 chess kings on it. The constraints are that no two kings can be placed in squares sharing a common vertex, and each row and each column must contain exactly 25 kings.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the pattern of king placement\nTo satisfy the constraints, the kings must be placed in a way that they are not adjacent to each other. This means that each king must be placed in a square that is not adjacent to any other king. Given the constraints, the only way to achieve this is to place the kings in a checkerboard pattern, where each king is placed in a square that is not adjacent to any other king.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to place the kings in the first row\nSince each row must contain exactly 25 kings, we can start by placing the kings in the first row. There are 100 squares in the first row, and we need to choose 25 of them to place the kings. This can be done in $\\binom{100}{25}$ ways.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to place the kings in the remaining rows\nOnce the kings are placed in the first row, we need to place the remaining kings in the remaining rows. Since each column must contain exactly 25 kings, we can place the kings in the remaining rows in a similar way. However, we need to take into account the fact that the kings in the first row are already placed, and we need to avoid placing kings in the same column as the kings in the first row. This means that we need to choose 25 squares from the remaining 75 squares in each row, but we need to avoid choosing squares that are in the same column as the kings in the first row.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of ways to place the kings in the remaining rows, considering the constraints\nTo calculate the number of ways to place the kings in the remaining rows, we need to consider the constraints. We can place the kings in the remaining rows in a similar way as the first row, but we need to avoid placing kings in the same column as the kings in the first row. This means that we need to choose 25 squares from the remaining 75 squares in each row, but we need to avoid choosing squares that are in the same column as the kings in the first row. This can be done in $\\binom{75}{25}$ ways for each row, but we need to take into account the fact that the kings in the first row are already placed, and we need to avoid placing kings in the same column as the kings in the first row.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the total number of arrangements\nTo calculate the total number of arrangements, we need to multiply the number of ways to place the kings in the first row by the number of ways to place the kings in the remaining rows. However, we need to take into account the fact that the arrangements are considered different if they differ by rotation or symmetry. This means that we need to divide the total number of arrangements by the number of possible rotations and symmetries.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the number of possible rotations and symmetries\nThe 100x100 chessboard has 8 possible rotations (0, 90, 180, 270 degrees) and 8 possible symmetries (reflection across the x-axis, y-axis, and 4 diagonals). This means that there are a total of 16 possible rotations and symmetries.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the final number of arrangements\nTo calculate the final number of arrangements, we need to multiply the number of ways to place the kings in the first row by the number of ways to place the kings in the remaining rows, and then divide by the number of possible rotations and symmetries.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the final number of arrangements, considering the constraints\nTo calculate the final number of arrangements, we need to consider the constraints. We can place the kings in the first row in $\\binom{100}{25}$ ways, and then place the kings in the remaining rows in $\\binom{75}{25}$ ways for each row. However, we need to take into account the fact that the kings in the first row are already placed, and we need to avoid placing kings in the same column as the kings in the first row. This means that we need to divide the total number of arrangements by the number of possible rotations and symmetries.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate the final number of arrangements, considering the constraints and the number of possible rotations and symmetries\nTo calculate the final number of arrangements, we need to multiply the number of ways to place the kings in the first row by the number of ways to place the kings in the remaining rows, and then divide by the number of possible rotations and symmetries.

This is a difference of squares, which can be factored as $(f_{1}(x)-x)(f_{1}(x)+x)=7$. Since $7$ is prime, the only possible factorizations are $1\\cdot7$ and $7\\cdot1$. However, neither of these factorizations can be achieved with polynomials with rational coefficients, since the product of two polynomials with rational coefficients cannot be a prime number.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the case of $n=2$\nIf $n=2$, then we have $x^{2}+7=f_{1}(x)^{2}+f_{2}(x)^{2}$. We can rewrite this as $f_{1}(x)^{2}+f_{2}(x)^{2}-x^{2}=7$. This is a sum of squares, which can be factored as $(f_{1}(x)+ix)(f_{1}(x)-ix)+(f_{2}(x)+ix)(f_{2}(x)-ix)=7$, where $i$ is the imaginary unit. However, this factorization cannot be achieved with polynomials with rational coefficients, since the product of two polynomials with rational coefficients cannot be a prime number.\n\n## Step 4: Consider the case of $n=3$\nIf $n=3$, then we have $x^{2}+7=f_{1}(x)^{2}+f_{2}(x)^{2}+f_{3}(x)^{2}$. We can rewrite this as $f_{1}(x)^{2}+f_{2}(x)^{2}+f_{3}(x)^{2}-x^{2}=7$. This is a sum of squares, which can be factored as $(f_{1}(x)+f_{2}(x)+f_{3}(x))(f_{1}(x)+f_{2}(x)-f_{3}(x))(f_{1}(x)-f_{2}(x)+f_{3}(x))(f_{1}(x)-f_{2}(x)-f_{3}(x))=7$. Since $7$ is prime, the only possible factorizations are $1\\cdot7$ and $7\\cdot1$.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given triangle $A B C$ and the points $J$, $A_{1}$, $B_{1}$, $C_{1}$, $D$, and $E$.\nStep 2:  We are given that $J$ is the center of the excircle tangent to side $B C$ at $A_{1}$ and to the extensions of sides $A C$ and $A B$ at $B_{1}$ and $C_{1}$, respectively. This means that $J$ is the point where the excircle intersects the extensions of the sides of the triangle.\nStep 3:  We are also given that the lines $A_{1} B_{1}$ and $A B$ are perpendicular and intersect at $D$. This implies that $D$ is the point of intersection of the two perpendicular lines.\nStep 4:  Additionally, we are told that $E$ is the foot of the perpendicular from $C_{1}$ to line $D J$. This means that $E$ is the point where the perpendicular from $C_{1}$ intersects the line $D J$.\nStep 5:  We need to determine the angles $\\angle B E A_{1}$ and $\\angle A E B_{1}$.\nStep 6:  To do this, we can use the properties of the excircle and the perpendicular lines to find the measures of these angles.\nStep 7:  We can start by considering the properties of the excircle and the perpendicular lines to find the measures of the angles $\\angle B E A_{1}$ and $\\angle A E B_{1}$.\n\nStep 8:  Since $J$ is the center of the excircle, we know that the angle $\\angle B A_{1} J$ is a right angle.

We claim that $n$ is a square of a prime number. We prove this by contradiction. Assume that $n$ is not a square of a prime number. Then $n$ can be written as a product of two positive integers $a$ and $b$ such that $1 < a, b < n$. Since $a$ and $b$ are positive divisors of $n$, we have $d_{1}, d_{2}, \\ldots, d_{k} \\in\\{1, a, b, ab\\}$. Since $a$ and $b$ are not equal to $1$, we have $a \\neq d_{1}$ and $b \\neq d_{1}$.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the conditions under which Luciano can draw tangent segments on the blackboard.\nStep 2:  The problem states that there are 2017 mutually external circles drawn on the blackboard, with no two circles being tangent and no three circles sharing a common tangent.\nStep 3:  We are asked to find all possible numbers of tangent segments that Luciano can draw until no more can be drawn.\nStep 4:  Let's consider the process of drawing tangent segments. Each time Luciano draws a tangent segment, it connects two circles, and this process continues until no more tangent segments can be drawn.\nStep 5:  We can represent the number of tangent segments as $t$ and the number of circles as $n$. The problem mentions that the number of tangent segments is less than the number of circles, i.e., $t < n$.\nStep 6:  Additionally, the problem states that the number of tangent segments is less than the number of circles, and the number of circles is less than the number of tangent segments plus the number of circles, i.e., $t < n$ and $n < t + n$.\nStep 7:  We can simplify the second inequality to $n < 2t$, which gives us a relationship between the number of tangent segments and the number of circles.\nStep 8:  Now, we need to find all possible values of $t$ that satisfy the given conditions.\nStep 9:  We can start by considering the smallest possible value of $t$, which is 0. However, this is not a valid solution as it would mean no tangent segments are drawn.\nStep 10:  The next possible value of $t$ is 1, but this also doesn't satisfy the conditions as it would mean only one circle is drawn.\nStep 11:  Moving on, we consider the value of $t$ as 2016, which satisfies the condition $t < n$. However, we need to check if it also satisfies the condition $n < 2t$.\nStep 12:  If $t = 2016$, then $n$ must be at least 2017, which satisfies the condition $n < 2t$.\nStep 13:  Therefore, the

This is because the numerator and denominator will both be even, making the fraction an integer.\n## Step 8:  We also consider the case when $x$ and $y$ are both odd. In this case, we can simplify the expression further by introducing a new variable $z = x^x y^y$.\n## Step 9:  We then analyze the properties of $z$ and find that if $z$ is an integer, then the expression is an integer.\n## Step 10:  We also consider the case when $x$ is even and $y$ is odd, and vice versa.

  "Step 1:  To find the smallest positive integer $k$ that allows for a unique partition of a $2n \\times 2n$ board into $1 \\times 2$ and $2 \\times 1$ dominoes, none of which contains two marked cells, we need to consider the properties of such a partition.\nStep 2:  First, we note that the total number of cells in the $2n \\times 2n$ board is $(2n)^2 = 4n^2$. Since each domino covers two cells, the total number of dominoes in the partition must be $2n^2$.\nStep 3:  We also observe that the number of $1 \\times 2$ dominoes must be even, as each of them covers two cells. This implies that the number of $2 \\times 1$ dominoes must also be even, as the total number of dominoes is $2n^2$.\nStep 4:  Now, we consider the parity of the number of marked cells. If the number of marked cells is even, then the number of $1 \\times 2$ dominoes must be even, and the number of $2 \\times 1$ dominoes must be even as well. This leads to a contradiction, as the total number of dominoes is $2n^2$, which is even.\nStep 5:  Therefore, the number of marked cells must be odd. This means that the number of $1 \\times 2$ dominoes must be odd, and the number of $2 \\times 1$ dominoes must be even.\nStep 6:  We can represent the number of $1 \\times 2$ dominoes as $2m + 1$ and the number of $2 \\times 1$ dominoes as $2m$, where $m$ is a non-negative integer.\nStep 7:  The total number of dominoes is $2n^2$, so we have the equation $2m + 1 + 2m = 2n^2$, which simplifies to $4m + 1 = 2n^2$.\nStep 8:  We need to find the smallest positive integer $k$ that satisfies this equation. To do this, we can rewrite the equation as $2m + 1 = 2n^2 - 2m$, which implies that $2m + 1$ is odd.\nStep 9:  Since $2m + 1$ is odd, we can represent it as $2m + 1 = 2(2n^2 - m) + 1$. This implies that $2n^2 - m$ is an integer.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the smallest positive integer $k$ that satisfies the equation is $k = 2n^2 - m$.\nStep 11:  To find the smallest value of $k$, we need to find the smallest value of $n$ that satisfies the equation $2n^2 - m = k$.\nStep 12:  We can start by trying small values of $n$ and see if we can find a corresponding value of $m$ that satisfies the equation.\nStep 13:  If we try $n = 1$, we get $2(1)^2 - m = k$, which simplifies to $2 - m = k$. However, this equation has no integer solution for $m$.\nStep 14:  If we try $n = 2$, we get $2(2)^2 - m = k$, which simplifies to $8 - m = k$. However, this equation also has no integer solution for $m$.\nStep 15:  If we try $n = 3$, we get $2(3)^2 - m = k$, which simplifies to $18 - m = k$. This equation has an integer solution for $m$, which is $m = 18 - k$.\nStep 16:  Therefore, the smallest positive integer $k$ that satisfies the equation is $k = 18 - m$.\nStep 17:  To find the smallest value of $k$, we need to find the smallest value of $m$ that satisfies the equation $18 - m = k$.\nStep 18:  We can start by trying small values of $m$ and see if we can find a corresponding value of $k$ that satisfies the equation.\nStep 19:  If we try $m = 1$, we get $18 - 1 = k$, which simplifies to $17 = k$. This is a valid solution, so the smallest positive integer $k$ that satisfies the equation is $k = 17$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{17}$",

This implies that $f(m) + f(1) - m$ divides $f(m) + m f(1) - m^2$.\nStep 5:  Since $f(m) + f(1) - m$ is nonzero, we can conclude that $f(m) + f(1) - m$ divides $f(m) + m f(1) - m^2$ for all positive integers $m$.\nStep 6:  We can further simplify the equation by setting $m = 1$ to get $f(1) + f(n) - n = f(1) + n f(1) - n^2$.\nStep 7:  This implies that $f(1) + f(n) - n$ divides $f(1) + n f(1) - n^2$ for all positive integers $n$.\nStep 8:  Combining these results, we find that $f(m) + f(1) - m$ divides $f(m) + m f(1) - m^2$ and $f(1) + f(n) - n$ divides $f(1) + n f(1) - n^2$ for all positive integers $m$ and $n$.\nStep 9:  We can then use these conditions to derive the possible forms of the function $f$.\nStep 10:  By analyzing the divisibility conditions, we can conclude that the function $f$ must be of the form $f(m) = m^2 + 1$ for all positive integers $m$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the only function $f: \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}$ that satisfies the given conditions is $f(m) = m^2 + 1$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{m^2 + 1}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest value of $k$ such that we can guarantee that there are two checkpoints that are linked by each of the two companies, A and B.\nStep 2:  We are given that there are $n^2$ checkpoints marked on the slope of a mountain, numbered from 1 to $n^2$ from the bottom to the top. Each of the two cable car companies, A and B, operates $k$ cable cars numbered from 1 to $k$.\nStep 3:  We are asked to find the smallest $k$ for which we can guarantee that there are two checkpoints that are linked by each of the two companies.\nStep 4:  To approach this problem, we can use the concept of graph theory and the properties of the given conditions to find the minimum value of $k$.\nStep 5:  We can represent the situation as a graph, where the checkpoints are the vertices, and the edges represent the links between the checkpoints provided by the cable car companies.\nStep 6:  We need to find the smallest $k$ such that the graph has a certain property, which we can use to guarantee the existence of two checkpoints linked by each of the two companies.\nStep 7:  We can use the properties of the graph, such as the number of edges and the connectivity of the graph, to determine the minimum value of $k$.\nStep 8:  By analyzing the graph and its properties, we can find the smallest $k$ that satisfies the given conditions and guarantees the existence of two checkpoints linked by each of the two companies.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the Fibonacci sequence and its properties. The Fibonacci sequence is defined inductively by $F_{0}=0, F_{1}=1$, and $F_{n+1}=F_{n}+F_{n-1}$ for $n \\geqslant 1$.\nStep 2:  We are asked to find the smallest size of a set $S$ of integers such that for every $k=2,3, \\ldots, n$ there exist some $x, y \\in S$ such that $x-y=F_{k}$.\nStep 3:  We start by considering the case when $n=2$. In this case, we need to find a set $S$ such that $F_{2}=1$ can be expressed as the difference of two elements in $S$. The smallest set that satisfies this condition is $S=\\{0,1\\}$.\nStep 4:  Next, we consider the case when $n=3$. Here, we need to find a set $S$ such that $F_{2}=1$ and $F_{3}=2$ can be expressed as the difference of two elements in $S$. The smallest set that satisfies this condition is $S=\\{0,1,2\\}$.\nStep 5:  We then proceed to the case when $n=4$. In this case, we need to find a set $S$ such that $F_{2}=1, F_{3}=2$, and $F_{4}=3$ can be expressed as the difference of two elements in $S$. The smallest set that satisfies this condition is $S=\\{0,1,2,3\\}$.\nStep 6:  We observe that for $n \\geqslant 4$, the set $S=\\{0,1,2,3\\}$ satisfies the condition for all $k=2,3, \\ldots, n$. This is because for any $k \\geqslant 4$, we can express $F_{k}$ as the difference of two elements in $S$.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the smallest size of the set $S$ is $\\boxed{4}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the rules of the game and how the players can maximize or minimize the number of cookies they receive.\nStep 2:  The game starts with 2020 copies of the number 1 on the blackboard. In each round, player A erases two numbers, and player B writes either the sum or the absolute difference of the two erased numbers.\nStep 3:  The game ends when one of the following conditions is met: (1) one of the numbers on the blackboard is larger than the sum of all other numbers, or (2) there are only zeros on the blackboard.\nStep 4:  Player B must then give as many cookies to player A as there are numbers on the blackboard. Player A wants to get as many cookies as possible, while player B wants to give as few as possible.\nStep 5:  We need to determine the number of cookies that A receives if both players play optimally.\nStep 6:  To do this, we can analyze the possible scenarios and the strategies that each player can employ to maximize or minimize the number of cookies.\nStep 7:  We can start by considering the initial state of the blackboard and how the numbers change after each round.\nStep 8:  We can then analyze the possible outcomes and the number of cookies that A receives in each case.\nStep 9:  By considering all possible scenarios and the strategies employed by both players, we can determine the optimal number of cookies that A receives.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2020}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the process that Harry follows to change the configuration of the coins.\nStep 2:  The process starts with a sequence of $n$ coins, each showing heads or tails, and Harry repeatedly flips the $k^{\\text {th }}$ coin over if there are $k$ coins showing heads and $k>0$. If there are no coins showing heads, he stops the process.\nStep 3:  We are asked to find the number of steps needed before all coins show tails, denoted by $\\ell(C)$, and then determine its average value over all $2^{n}$ possible initial configurations $C$.\nStep 4:  To approach this problem, we can use a recursive approach to find the number of steps needed for a given configuration $C$.\nStep 5:  We can represent the configuration $C$ as a sequence of $n$ letters, each of which is either $H$ or $T$. We can then use a recursive function $f(C)$ to find the number of steps needed to reach a configuration where all coins show tails.\nStep 6:  The recursive function $f(C)$ is defined as follows: if $C$ ends in $T$, then $f(C)=0$; if $C$ ends in $H$, then $f(C)=1+f(H C)$, where $H C$ denotes the configuration obtained by flipping the last coin in $C$.\nStep 7:  We can then use this recursive function to find the number of steps needed for a given configuration $C$.\nStep 8:  To find the average value of $\\ell(C)$ over all $2^{n}$ possible initial configurations $C$, we can use the linearity of expectation. This involves finding the expected value of $\\ell(C)$ for a single coin and then multiplying it by $n$ to get the average value for all $n$ coins.\nStep 9:  By following these steps, we can determine the average value of $\\ell(C)$ over all $2^{n}$ possible initial configurations $C$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{n2^{n-1}}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the rules of the game and how Alice and Bob can win or lose.\nStep 2:  The game starts with 60 empty boxes, and Alice and Bob take turns adding and removing pebbles from the boxes.\nStep 3:  In each round, Bob chooses a box and splits the boxes into two groups. Alice then picks one of these groups, adds a pebble to each box in that group, and removes a pebble from each box in the other group.\nStep 4:  The goal for Bob is to make a box contain no pebbles, while Alice's goal is to prevent this from happening.\nStep 5:  We are asked to find the smallest number of pebbles, denoted as $n$, such that Alice can prevent Bob from winning.\nStep 6:  To approach this problem, we need to consider the minimum number of pebbles required in each box to prevent Bob from winning.\nStep 7:  We can start by considering the minimum number of pebbles required in each box to prevent Bob from winning in the first round.\nStep 8:  Since there are 60 boxes, the minimum number of pebbles required in each box to prevent Bob from winning in the first round is $n \\geq 60$.\nStep 9:  However, this is not sufficient to prevent Bob from winning in subsequent rounds. We need to consider the minimum number of pebbles required in each box to prevent Bob from winning in the second round.\nStep 10:  In the second round, Bob can choose any box and split the boxes into two groups. Alice then picks one of these groups and adds a pebble to each box in that group, and removes a pebble from each box in the other group.\nStep 11:  To prevent Bob from winning in the second round, the minimum number of pebbles required in each box is $n \\geq 60 \\cdot 59 = 3540$.\nStep 12:  However, this is still not sufficient to prevent Bob from winning in subsequent rounds. We need to consider the minimum number of pebbles required in each box to prevent Bob from winning in the third round.\nStep 13:  In the third round, Bob can choose any box and split the boxes into two groups. Alice then picks one of these groups and adds a pebble to each box in that group, and removes a pebble from each box in the other group.\nStep 14:  To prevent Bob from winning in the third round, the minimum number of pebbles required in each box is $n \\geq 60 \\cdot 59 \\cdot 58 = 207240$.\nStep 15:  We can see that the minimum number of pebbles required in each box to prevent Bob from winning increases exponentially with each round.\nStep 16:  Therefore, the smallest $n$ such that Alice can prevent Bob from winning is the minimum number of pebbles required in each box to prevent Bob from winning in the third round, which is $n \\geq 60 \\cdot 59 \\cdot 58 = 207240$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{208}$",

  "## Step 1: Understand the given functional equation\nThe given functional equation is $f(x-f(y))=f(f(x))-f(y)-1$. We need to find all functions $f: \\mathbb{Z} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}$ that satisfy this equation for all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n## Step 2: Substitute $x = f(y)$ into the equation\nSubstituting $x = f(y)$ into the equation, we get $f(f(y)-f(y))=f(f(f(y)))-f(y)-1$. This simplifies to $f(0)=f(f(f(y)))-f(y)-1$.\n\n## Step 3: Substitute $y = 0$ into the equation\nSubstituting $y = 0$ into the equation, we get $f(x-f(0))=f(f(x))-f(0)-1$.\n\n## Step 4: Set $x = f(0)$ in the equation from step 3\nSetting $x = f(0)$ in the equation from step 3, we get $f(f(0)-f(0))=f(f(f(0)))-f(0)-1$. This simplifies to $f(0)=f(f(f(0)))-f(0)-1$.\n\n## Step 5: Compare the equations from step 2 and step 4\nComparing the equations from step 2 and step 4, we see that $f(0)=f(f(f(0)))-f(0)-1$ and $f(0)=f(f(f(y)))-f(y)-1$. Since these equations hold for all $y \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, we can substitute $f(f(f(y)))$ for $f(0)$ in the second equation to get $f(f(f(y)))=f(f(f(f(y))))-f(y)-1$.\n\n## Step 6: Substitute $y = f(y)$ into the equation from step 5\nSubstituting $y = f(y)$ into the equation from step 5, we get $f(f(f(f(y))))=f(f(f(f(f(y)))))-f(f(y))-1$.\n\n## Step 7: Substitute $y = f(f(y))$ into the equation from step 5\nSubstituting $y = f(f(y))$ into the equation from step 5, we get $f(f(f(f(f(f(y)))))=f(f(f(f(f(f(f(y)))))))-f(f(f(y)))-1$.\n\n## Step 8: Observe the pattern in the equations from step 6 and step 7\nObserve that the equations from step 6 and step 7 have a pattern where the number of $f$'s increases by 1 in each step.\n\n## Step 9: Generalize the pattern\nGeneralizing the pattern, we can write the equation as $f^{(n)}(y)=f^{(n+1)}(y)-f^{(n-1)}(y)-1$, where $f^{(n)}(y)$ denotes the composition of $f$ with itself $n$ times.\n\n## Step 10: Solve the equation\nSolving the equation, we get $f^{(n)}(y)=f^{(n+1)}(y)-f^{(n-1)}(y)-1$.\n\n## Step 11: Find the solution\nThe solution to the equation is $f(x) = x + 1$.\n\n## Step 12: Verify the solution\nVerifying the solution, we can plug it back into the original equation to check if it satisfies the equation.\n\n## Step 13: Check if the solution satisfies the original equation\nPlugging $f(x) = x + 1$ back into the original equation, we get $f(x-f(y))=f(f(x))-f(y)-1$. Simplifying, we get $(x-f(y))+1=(f(x)+1)-f(y)-1$, which is true.\n\n## Step 14: Conclusion\nTherefore, the solution to the functional equation is $f(x) = x + 1$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

\\leqslant 2 n}(s-r-n) x_{r} x_{s} + \\sum_{1 \\leqslant r<s \\leqslant 2 n}(r-s+n) x_{s} x_{r} = \\sum_{1 \\leqslant r<s \\leqslant 2 n}[(s-r-n) x_{r} x_{s} + (r-s+n) x_{s} x_{r}]$.\n## Step 6:  Further simplifying, we get $\\sum_{1 \\leqslant r<s \\leqslant 2 n}[(s-r-n) x_{r} x_{s} + (r-s+n) x_{s} x_{r}] = \\sum_{1 \\leqslant r<s \\leqslant 2 n}[(s-r-n) x_{r} x_{s} + (r-s+n) x_{s} x_{r}] = \\sum_{1 \\leqslant r<s \\leqslant 2 n}[(s-r-n) x_{r} x_{s} + (r-s+n) x_{s} x_{r}]$.\n## Step 7:  We can then factor out the common terms to get $\\sum_{1 \\leqslant r<s \\leqslant 2 n}[(s-r-n) x_{r} x_{s} + (r-s+n) x_{s} x_{r}] = \\sum_{1 \\leqslant r<s \\leqslant 2 n}[(s-r-n) x_{r} x_{s} + (r-s+n) x_{s} x_{r}] = \\sum_{1 \\leqslant r<s \\leqslant 2 n}[(s-r-n) x_{r} x_{s} + (r-s+n) x_{s} x_{r}]$.\n## Step 8:  This simplifies to $\\sum_{1 \\leqslant r<s \\leqslant 2 n}[(s-r-n) x_{r} x_{s} + (r-s+n) x_{s} x_{r}] = \\sum_{1 \\leqslant r<s \\leqslant 2 n}[(s-r-n) x_{r} x_{s} + (r-s+n)

  "Step 1:  The given functional equation is $f(x+f(x+y))+f(x y)=x+f(x+y)+y f(x)$ for all real numbers $x$ and $y$.\nStep 2:  To solve this equation, we can start by substituting specific values for $x$ and $y$ to simplify the equation and identify any patterns or relationships that can help us find the function $f$.\nStep 3:  We can begin by setting $x = y = 0$ in the given functional equation. This gives us $f(f(0)) + f(0) = f(0) + 0.$\nStep 4:  Simplifying this, we get $f(f(0)) = 0.$\nStep 5:  Next, we set $x = 0$ and $y = -f(0)$ in the original functional equation. This gives us $f(f(0)) + f(0) = 0 + f(0) - f(0)^2.$\nStep 6:  From the previous result, we know that $f(f(0)) = 0,$ so we have $0 + f(0) = 0 - f(0)^2.$\nStep 7:  This simplifies to $f(0)^2 = f(0),$ which implies that $f(0) = 0$ or $f(0) = 1.$\nStep 8:  We then proceed to consider the case where $f(0) = 0$ and the case where $f(0) = 1$ separately to find the possible forms of the function $f$.\nStep 9:  If $f(0) = 0,$ we can set $y = 0$ in the original functional equation to obtain $f(x + f(x)) + f(0) = x + f(x) + 0.$\nStep 10:  Simplifying this, we get $f(x + f(x)) = x + f(x).$\nStep 11:  Setting $x = f(x)$ in this equation, we find that $f(f(x) + f(f(x))) = f(x) + f(f(x)).$\nStep 12:  Using the result $f(x + f(x)) = x + f(x),$ we can simplify this to $f(x) + f(f(x)) = f(x) + f(f(x)).$\nStep 13:  This implies that $f(f(x)) = f(f(x)),$ which is true for all $x.$\nStep 14:  Therefore, we have $f(x) = x$ for all $x.$\nStep 15:  On the other hand, if $f(0) = 1,$ we can set $x = 0$ in the original functional equation to obtain $f(y + 1) + f(0) = 0 + f(y) + y.$\nStep 16:  Simplifying this, we get $f(y + 1) = f(y) + y - 1.$\nStep 17:  Setting $y = 0$ in this equation, we find that $f(1) = f(0) + 0 - 1 = 0.$\nStep 18:  Then, setting $y = 1$ in the equation $f(y + 1) = f(y) + y - 1,$ we get $f(2) = f(1) + 1 - 1 = 0.$\nStep 19:  Continuing this process, we find that $f(n) = 0$ for all positive integers $n.$\nStep 20:  However, this leads to a contradiction when we set $x = 0$ and $y = -1$ in the original functional equation.\nStep 21:  Therefore, we conclude that $f(x) = x$ for all $x.$\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{x}$",

  "To find all $k$ such that there exists a $k$-good function, we need to understand the properties of the function and the implications of the greatest common divisor (gcd) condition.\n\n## Step 1: Understanding the gcd condition\nThe gcd condition states that for all $m \\neq n$, $\\operatorname{gcd}(f(m)+n, f(n)+m) \\leqslant k$. This means that the greatest common divisor of the two expressions $f(m)+n$ and $f(n)+m$ is less than or equal to $k$.\n\n## Step 2: Analyzing the gcd condition for small values of k\nLet's start by analyzing the gcd condition for small values of $k$. If $k=1$, then the gcd condition becomes $\\operatorname{gcd}(f(m)+n, f(n)+m) \\leqslant 1$. This means that the two expressions $f(m)+n$ and $f(n)+m$ must be relatively prime, i.e., they have no common factors other than 1.\n\n## Step 3: Finding a k-good function for k=1\nTo find a $k$-good function for $k=1$, we need to find a function $f$ such that $\\operatorname{gcd}(f(m)+n, f(n)+m) \\leqslant 1$ for all $m \\neq n$. One possible function is $f(x) = x$.

If $k>1$, then the gcd condition becomes $\\operatorname{gcd}(f(m)+n, f(n)+m) \\leqslant k$. This means that the two expressions $f(m)+n$ and $f(n)+m$ must have a common factor of at most $k$.\n\n## Step 5: Finding a k-good function for larger values of k\nTo find a $k$-good function for larger values of $k$, we need to find a function $f$ such that $\\operatorname{gcd}(f(m)+n, f(n)+m) \\leqslant k$ for all $m \\neq n$. One possible function is $f(x) = kx$. This function satisfies the gcd condition because $f(m)+n = km+n$ and $f(n)+m = kn+m$, and the gcd of $km+n$ and $kn+m$ is always $k$.\n\n## Step 6: Generalizing the result\nBased on the analysis above, we can see that for any positive integer $k$, there exists a $k$-good function $f(x) = kx$. This function satisfies the gcd condition because the gcd of $km+n$ and $kn+m$ is always $k$.\n\n## Step 7: Conclusion\nTherefore, we can conclude that for any positive integer $k$, there exists a $k$-good function.

This means that the winning rule must be transitive, i.e., if A beats B and B beats C, then A beats C.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the possible ways to define the winning rule based on the relative order of the elements\nBased on the relative order of the elements, there are two possible ways to define the winning rule: (1) the set with the larger element at each position beats the other set, or (2) the set with the smaller element at each position beats the other set.\n\n## Step 6: Consider the implications of the two possible ways to define the winning rule\nIf we define the winning rule as the set with the larger element at each position beats the other set, then the winning rule is not transitive. For example, if A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {4, 5, 6}, then A beats B. If B = {7, 8, 9} and C = {10, 11, 12}, then B beats C.

This means that for any $i$ and $j$ with $1 \\leqslant i<j \\leqslant n$, we have $a_{j}-a_{i}=r^{k}$ for some $k$.\nStep 4:  We can then consider the implications of this condition on the values of $a_{i}$ and $a_{j}$, and how they relate to the value of $r$.\nStep 5:  Additionally, we need to consider the condition that $r>0$, which implies that the numbers $r^{1}, r^{2}, \\ldots, r^{\\frac{1}{2} n(n-1)}$ are all positive.\nStep 6:  By analyzing these conditions and their implications, we can determine the possible values of $n$ that satisfy the given conditions.\nStep 7:  We can then use this analysis to find the values of $n$ for which there exist $n$ real numbers $a_{1}<\\cdots<a_{n}$ and a real number $r>0$ such that the $\\frac{1}{2} n(n-1)$ differences $a_{j}-a_{i}$ for $1 \\leqslant i<j \\leqslant n$ are equal, in some order, to the numbers $r^{1}, r^{2}, \\ldots, r^{\\frac{1}{2} n(n-1)}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{n=2,3,4,5}$",
  "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are given a sequence of 2022 numbers, each equal to either +1 or -1. We need to find the largest C such that for any sequence, there exists an integer k and indices $t_{1}, \\ldots, t_{k}$ so that $t_{i+1}-t_{i} \\leqslant 2$ for all i, and the absolute value of the sum of the numbers at these indices is greater than or equal to C.\n\n## Step 2: Consider the possible values of the sum\nSince each number in the sequence is either +1 or -1, the sum of any k consecutive numbers can be at most k and at least -k.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the maximum value of C\nTo maximize C, we want to minimize k. Since $t_{i+1}-t_{i} \\leqslant 2$ for all i, the minimum value of k is the number of pairs of consecutive numbers in the sequence. This is equal to 2022/2 = 1011.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the maximum value of C\nThe maximum value of C is the minimum value of the sum of k consecutive numbers, which is -k. Therefore, the maximum value of C is -1011.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the case where the sum is negative\nIf the sum is negative, we can take the absolute value of the sum, which is greater than or equal to the absolute value of -1011.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the final answer\nThe largest C such that for any sequence, there exists an integer k and indices $t_{1}, \\ldots, t_{k}$ so that $t_{i+1}-t_{i} \\leqslant 2$ for all i, and the absolute value of the sum of the numbers at these indices is greater than or equal to C, is 1011.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1011}$",
  "## Step 1: Understand the game dynamics\nThe game involves a gardener and a lumberjack taking turns on a $2022 \\times 2022$ board. The gardener increases the height of trees on a chosen square and its surrounding squares, while the lumberjack decreases the height of trees on four chosen squares.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the impact of the gardener's move\nWhen the gardener chooses a square, each tree on that square and its surrounding squares (at most eight) becomes one unit taller. This means that the gardener can increase the height of trees in a $3 \\times 3$ or $5 \\times 5$ pattern, depending on the starting square.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the impact of the lumberjack's move\nWhen the lumberjack chooses four different squares, each tree of positive height on those squares becomes one unit shorter. This means that the lumberjack can decrease the height of trees in a $2 \\times 2$ pattern, depending on the chosen squares.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the effect of the game on majestic trees\nA tree is majestic if its height is at least $10^{6}$. To ensure that there are eventually $K$ majestic trees on the board, the gardener needs to create a situation where the lumberjack cannot decrease the height of trees below $10^{6}$.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the worst-case scenario for the gardener\nIn the worst-case scenario, the lumberjack chooses the four squares that the gardener just increased, effectively canceling out the gardener's move. However, the gardener can still increase the height of trees in a $3 \\times 3$ or $5 \\times 5$ pattern, creating a \"wall\" of trees that the lumberjack cannot easily destroy.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the maximum number of majestic trees\nThe gardener can create a \"wall\" of majestic trees by increasing the height of trees in a $5 \\times 5$ pattern, with each tree having a height of at least $10^{6}$. Since the lumberjack cannot easily destroy this \"wall,\" the gardener can ensure that there are eventually $K$ majestic trees on the board.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the maximum number of majestic trees\nThe maximum number of majestic trees is equal to the number of $5 \\times 5$ patterns that can fit on the $2022 \\times 2022$ board. Since each pattern has 25 squares, the maximum number of majestic trees is $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{2022 \\times 2022}{25} \\right\\rfloor = 16384$.\n\n## Step 8: Consider the effect of the lumberjack's move on the \"wall\"\nWhen the lumberjack chooses four squares, they can decrease the height of trees in a $2 \\times 2$ pattern. However, this will not affect the \"wall\" of majestic trees, as the lumberjack cannot decrease the height of trees below $10^{6}$.\n\n## Step 9: Determine the final answer\nThe largest number $K$ such that the gardener can ensure there are eventually $K$ majestic trees on the board is $\\boxed{16384}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{16384}$",

  "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nAlice has filled an $n \\times n$ board with numbers from 1 to $n^{2}$, each number being used exactly once. She then counts the total number of good paths on the board. A good path is a sequence of fields of arbitrary length (including 1) such that: (i) The first field in the sequence is one that is only adjacent to fields with larger numbers, (ii) Each subsequent field in the sequence is adjacent to the previous field, (iii) The numbers written on the fields in the sequence are in increasing order.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the smallest possible number of good paths\nTo find the smallest possible number of good paths, we need to consider the arrangement of numbers on the board that minimizes the number of good paths. We can start by considering the smallest possible number of good paths for a $2 \\times 2$ board.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the $2 \\times 2$ board\nFor a $2 \\times 2$ board, the smallest possible number of good paths is 2. This is because there are only two possible good paths: one that starts at the top-left corner and moves to the top-right corner, and one that starts at the bottom-left corner and moves to the bottom-right corner.\n\n## Step 4: Generalize to an $n \\times n$ board\nTo generalize this to an $n \\times n$ board, we can consider the arrangement of numbers on the board that minimizes the number of good paths. We can start by placing the numbers 1 to $n^{2}$ in a spiral pattern on the board.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze the spiral pattern\nThe spiral pattern has the property that each number is adjacent to at least one number with a larger value. This means that any path that starts at a number with a larger value will be a good path.\n\n## Step 6: Count the number of good paths\nUsing the spiral pattern, we can count the number of good paths. Each number on the board is adjacent to at least one number with a larger value, so each number can be the starting point of a good path. The number of good paths starting at each number is equal to the number of paths from that number to the top-right corner of the board.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the number of good paths\nThe number of good paths starting at each number is equal to the number of paths from that number to the top-right corner of the board. This can be calculated using the formula for the number of paths in a grid, which is given by $\\binom{n}{k}$, where $n$ is the number of steps and $k$ is the number of steps in the $x$-direction.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the total number of good paths\nThe total number of good paths is equal to the sum of the number of good paths starting at each number. This can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.\n\n## Step 9: Simplify the expression\nThe expression for the total number of good paths can be simplified using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.\n\n## Step 10: Find the smallest possible number of good paths\nThe smallest possible number of good paths is given by the simplified expression.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2n^{2}-4n+2}$",

  "Step 1:  To find the smallest Norwegian number, we need to understand what a Norwegian number is. A Norwegian number is defined as a number that has three distinct positive divisors whose sum is equal to 2022.\nStep 2:  We are given the equation $a + b + c = 2022$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the three distinct positive divisors of the Norwegian number.\nStep 3:  We also know that the number of divisors of a number can be found using its prime factorization. If a number $n$ has prime factorization $p_1^{e_1} \\cdot p_2^{e_2} \\cdot ... \\cdot p_k^{e_k}$, then the number of divisors of $n$ is given by $(e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1)...(e_k + 1)$.\nStep 4:  We are looking for the smallest Norwegian number, so we need to find the smallest number that satisfies the given conditions.\nStep 5:  We start by considering the smallest possible values for $a$, $b$, and $c$. Since they are distinct positive divisors, the smallest possible value for each of them is 1.\nStep 6:  We then consider the next smallest values for $a$, $b$, and $c$. Since they are distinct positive divisors, the next smallest possible value for each of them is 2.\nStep 7:  We continue this process until we find a combination of $a$, $b$, and $c$ that satisfies the equation $a + b + c = 2022$.\nStep 8:  After trying different combinations, we find that the smallest Norwegian number is $2^3 \\cdot 3^3 \\cdot 7^3$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the smallest Norwegian number is $2^3 \\cdot 3^3 \\cdot 7^3 = \\boxed{9072}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{9072}$",

  "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are tasked with finding all triples of positive integers $(a, b, p)$ where $p$ is a prime number, and the equation $a^{p}=b !+p$ holds true.\n\n## Step 2: Consider the properties of factorials\nThe factorial of a number $n$, denoted as $n!$, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to $n$. For example, $5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120$. Given that $b!$ is a factorial, it is always a positive integer.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the equation $a^{p}=b !+p$\nSince $p$ is a prime number, it is only divisible by 1 and itself. This means that $a^{p}$ will always be a multiple of $p$ because $a$ is raised to a power that is a multiple of $p$. On the other hand, $b!$ is a product of consecutive integers, and $p$ is a prime number. Therefore, $p$ cannot be a factor of $b!$ unless $p$ is less than or equal to $b$.\n\n## Step 4: Consider the case when $p$ is less than or equal to $b$\nIf $p$ is less than or equal to $b$, then $p$ is a factor of $b!$. In this case, the equation $a^{p}=b !+p$ can be rewritten as $a^{p} - p = b!$. Since $p$ is a factor of $b!$, we can divide both sides of the equation by $p$ to get $a^{p} - 1 = \\frac{b!}{p}$. This implies that $a^{p} - 1$ is a multiple of $p$, which means that $a^{p} - 1$ is also a multiple of $p$.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the case when $p$ is greater than $b$\nIf $p$ is greater than $b$, then $p$ is not a factor of $b!$. In this case, the equation $a^{p}=b !+p$ implies that $a^{p}$ is a multiple of $p$ and $b!$ is not a multiple of $p$. This is a contradiction because $a^{p}$ and $b!$ are both integers, and $p$ is a prime number.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze the equation $a^{p} - 1 = \\frac{b!}{p}$\nSince $a^{p} - 1$ is a multiple of $p$, we can write $a^{p} - 1 = kp$ for some integer $k$. This implies that $a^{p} = kp + 1$. Since $p$ is a prime number, $p$ cannot divide $a^{p} - 1$ unless $p$ divides $a^{p}$. However, $p$ cannot divide $a^{p}$ unless $p$ divides $a$. This means that $a$ must be a multiple of $p$.\n\n## Step 7: Consider the case when $a$ is a multiple of $p$\nIf $a$ is a multiple of $p$, then $a = pm$ for some integer $m$. Substituting this into the equation $a^{p} = kp + 1$, we get $(pm)^{p} = kp + 1$. Expanding the left-hand side, we get $p^{p}m^{p} = kp + 1$. Since $p^{p}$ is a multiple of $p$, we can divide both sides of the equation by $p^{p}$ to get $m^{p} = \\frac{k}{p^{p-1}} + \\frac{1}{p^{p}}$.\n\n## Step 8: Analyze the equation $m^{p} = \\frac{k}{p^{p-1}} + \\frac{1}{p^{p}}$\nSince $m$ is an integer, $m^{p}$ is also an integer. However, the right-hand side of the equation is a sum of two fractions, and it is not clear whether the right-hand side is an integer. This is a contradiction because $m^{p}$ and the right-hand side of the equation are both integers.\n\n## Step 9: Consider the case when $a$ is not a multiple of $p$\nIf $a$ is not a multiple of $p$, then $a$ and $p$ are relatively prime. This means that $a^{p} - 1$ is not a multiple of $p$, which contradicts the fact that $a^{p} - 1$ is a multiple of $p$.\n\n## Step 10: Conclusion\nBased on the analysis above, we can conclude that there are no triples of positive integers $(a, b, p)$ that satisfy the equation $a^{p}=b !+p$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

  "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem is asking us to find the maximum number of black knights that Horst can place on a $20 \\times 20$ chessboard in such a way that they do not attack each other, regardless of the strategy of Queenie, who places white queens on the board.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the constraints\nThe constraints are that the knights must be placed on empty squares in such a way that they do not attack any previous knights, and the queens must be placed on empty squares.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the possible moves for knights\nA knight can move in an L-shape (two squares in one direction, then one square to the side) to an adjacent square. This means that a knight can move to one of eight possible squares from its current position.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the possible moves for queens\nA queen can move horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to any number of squares. This means that a queen can attack any square on the same row, column, or diagonal as the queen.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze the relationship between knights and queens\nSince a knight can move to one of eight possible squares, it can be blocked by a queen on any of those squares. However, a queen can block a knight on any square on the same row, column, or diagonal.\n\n## Step 6: Consider the worst-case scenario for Horst\nIn the worst-case scenario, Queenie places a queen on every square that a knight can move to, blocking all possible moves for the knight. This means that Horst can only place knights on squares that are not on the same row, column, or diagonal as any queen.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the maximum number of knights\nSince there are 20 rows and 20 columns on the chessboard, there are 400 squares in total.

This means that Horst can only place knights on 1/8 of the remaining squares after Queenie has placed her queens.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the maximum number of knights\nSince there are 400 squares in total, and Horst can only place knights on 1/8 of the remaining squares, the maximum number of knights is 400 * (1 - 1/8) = 400 * 7/8 = 350.\n\n## Step 9: Consider the optimal strategy for Horst\nHowever, this is not the optimal strategy for Horst.

To maximize the number of knights, Horst should place knights on squares that are not on the same row, column, or diagonal as any queen.\n\n## Step 12: Consider the optimal strategy for Horst\nThe optimal strategy for Horst is to place knights on squares that are not on the same row, column, or diagonal as any queen. This means that Horst should place knights on squares that are not blocked by queens.\n\n## Step 13: Calculate the maximum number of knights\nSince there are 400 squares in total, and Horst can place knights on squares that are not blocked by queens, the maximum number of knights is 400 - (number of queens).\n\n## Step 14: Consider the worst-case scenario for Horst\nIn the worst-case scenario, Queenie places a queen on every square that a knight can move to, blocking all possible moves for the knight.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the constraints and requirements of the tournament schedule.\nStep 2:  The committee has to schedule matches for $2k$ players, ensuring that every two players play once, and each player arrives on the day of their first match and departs on the day of their last match.\nStep 3:  The cost of the tournament is determined by the total number of days each player is present, with each day costing 1 coin.\nStep 4:  We are asked to find the minimum cost of all players' stays, which means we need to minimize the total number of days each player is present.\nStep 5:  To approach this, we can consider the number of matches each player plays and the number of days they are present.\nStep 6:  Since each player plays $k-1$ matches, they must be present for $k-1$ days, as they arrive on the day of their first match and depart on the day of their last match.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the total cost of the tournament is the sum of the number of days each player is present, which is $(k-1) \\cdot 2k$.\nStep 8:  This is because there are $2k$ players, and each player is present for $k-1$ days.\nStep 9:  So, the minimum cost of all players' stays is $(k-1) \\cdot 2k = 2k^2 - 2k$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the minimum cost is $\\boxed{2k^2 - 2k}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2k^2 - 2k}$",

A good collection $T$ of triangles must satisfy two conditions: (i) each triangle from $T$ is inscribed in $\\omega$, and (ii) no two triangles from $T$ have a common interior point.\nStep 3:  We are asked to find the values of $t$ such that for each positive integer $n$, there exists a good collection of $n$ triangles, each of perimeter greater than $t$.\nStep 4:  To approach this problem, we can start by considering the properties of the triangles and the circle. We know that the radius of the circle is 1, so the diameter is 2. This gives us a starting point to work with.\nStep 5:  We can then consider the perimeter of the triangles and how it relates to the circle. The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of its sides.

In this case, we have a single number $a_1$ that sums up to $n$.

  "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem asks us to find the minimal number of lines, denoted as $k$, that can be drawn in a plane without passing through the marked points, such that the plane is divided into regions where no region contains points of both colors (red and blue). The marked points are 2013 red points and 2014 blue points, and no three of the marked points are collinear.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the key constraints\nThe key constraints are that no three marked points are collinear, and we need to divide the plane into regions where no region contains points of both colors. This implies that each line drawn should separate the red points from the blue points.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the minimum number of lines required\nTo separate the red points from the blue points, we need to consider the minimum number of lines required to achieve this. Since there are 2013 red points and 2014 blue points, we can think of this as a problem of separating two sets of points.\n\n## Step 4: Use the concept of separating sets\nThe concept of separating sets can be applied here.

If the lines intersect, we may end up with regions that contain points of both colors. To avoid this, we need to ensure that the lines do not intersect.\n\n## Step 8: Use the concept of non-intersecting lines\nTo ensure that the lines do not intersect, we can use the concept of non-intersecting lines. We can draw lines that are non-intersecting, which means that they do not intersect with each other.\n\n## Step 9: Determine the minimum number of non-intersecting lines required\nSince we need to separate the red points from the blue points, we can draw 2013 non-intersecting lines that pass through the red points and not the blue points.\n\n## Step 10: Consider the case where the lines are non-intersecting\nHowever, we need to consider the case where the lines are non-intersecting.

A triangle is non-degenerated if the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side.\n## Step 3:  We are given that the lengths of the sides of each triangle are sorted in ascending order for each color.

We need to find the largest possible integer $k$ such that for every color, there exist $k$ indices $j$ such that the triangle with side lengths $b_{j}, r_{j}, w_{j}$ is non-degenerated.\n## Step 8:  Finally, we can consider the largest side of each triangle, which is white. We need to find the largest possible integer $k$ such that for every color, there exist $k$ indices $j$ such that the triangle with side lengths $b_{j}, r_{j}, w_{j}$ is non-degenerated.\n## Step 9:  By considering these conditions, we can determine the largest possible integer $k$ such that for 2009 arbitrary non-degenerated triangles, with each side colored blue, red, or white, there exist $k$ indices $j$ such that we can form a non-degenerated triangle with side lengths $b_{j}, r_{j}, w_{j}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{668}$",

  "Step 1:  To find the maximal number of triples $\\left(a_{i}, b_{i}, c_{i}\\right)$ satisfying the given conditions, we need to consider the possible combinations of nonnegative integers $a_{i}, b_{i},$ and $c_{i}$ that add up to $n$ for each $i$.\nStep 2:  The first condition states that $a_{i}+b_{i}+c_{i}=n$ for all $i=1, \\ldots, N(n)$. This means that for each triple, the sum of the three nonnegative integers must be equal to $n$.\nStep 3:  The second condition specifies that if $i \\neq j$, then $a_{i} \\neq a_{j}, b_{i} \\neq b_{j}$, and $c_{i} \\neq c_{j}$. This implies that for any two distinct triples, the values of $a_{i}$, $b_{i}$, and $c_{i}$ must be different.\nStep 4:  We are asked to determine the maximal number of triples $N(n)$ for all $n \\geq 2$.\nStep 5:  To approach this problem, we can start by considering the possible values of $a_{i}$, $b_{i}$, and $c_{i}$ for a given $n$.

  "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the movement of the limp rook and how it can create a non-intersecting route on the $999 \\times 999$ board.\n## Step 2:  The limp rook can move in a way that it can visit any of its adjacent squares, and every move must be a turn, meaning the directions of any two consecutive moves must be perpendicular.\n## Step 3:  We are asked to find the longest possible cyclic, non-intersecting route that the limp rook can visit.\n## Step 4:  To approach this, we can consider the possible routes that the limp rook can take and try to find the longest one.\n## Step 5:  We can start by considering the possible directions of the first move, which can be either horizontal or vertical.\n## Step 6:  If the first move is horizontal, then the second move must be vertical, and vice versa.\n## Step 7:  This means that the route will consist of alternating horizontal and vertical moves.\n## Step 8:  We can then consider the number of squares that the limp rook can visit in each direction.\n## Step 9:  In the horizontal direction, the rook can visit $999$ squares, and in the vertical direction, it can also visit $999$ squares.\n## Step 10:  However, since the route must be non-intersecting, the rook cannot visit the same square more than once.\n## Step 11:  Therefore, the longest possible cyclic, non-intersecting route will be the one that visits the maximum number of squares in both the horizontal and vertical directions.\n## Step 12:  By considering the possible routes and the constraints of the problem, we can determine the longest possible cyclic, non-intersecting route that the limp rook can visit.\n## Step 13:  The longest possible cyclic, non-intersecting route will be the one that visits $999$ squares in both the horizontal and vertical directions, resulting in a total of $999 \\times 2 = 1998$ squares.\n## Step 14:  However, this is not the correct answer, as the problem asks for the number of squares in the longest possible cyclic, non-intersecting route.\n## Step 15:  We need to consider the fact that the route must be cyclic, meaning that the rook can move directly from the last square to the first square and start over.\n## Step 16:  This means that the longest possible cyclic, non-intersecting route will be the one that visits $999$ squares in both the horizontal and vertical directions, and then returns to the starting point, resulting in a total of $999 \\times 2 + 1 = 1999$ squares.\n## Step 17:  Therefore, the longest possible cyclic, non-intersecting route that the limp rook can visit is $1999$ squares.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1999}$",

We can simplify this expression to $a_{k+1}=\\frac{a_{k}^{2}-a_{k-1}}{a_{k-1}+1}$.\n## Step 4:  Next, we define a new sequence $b_k = a_{k} - a_{k-1}$ to simplify the relation further.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the conditions given for the boxes $B_{1}, \\ldots, B_{n}$ and how they intersect.\nStep 2:  The problem states that two boxes $B_{i}$ and $B_{j}$ intersect if and only if $i \\not \\equiv j \\pm 1(\\bmod n)$. This means that for any two boxes to intersect, their indices must not be consecutive modulo $n$.\nStep 3:  We are asked to find the largest $n$ for which there exist $n$ boxes satisfying this condition.\nStep 4:  To approach this, we can start by considering the arrangement of the boxes in the plane. We can visualize the boxes as rectangles with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and positive length.\nStep 5:  The condition $i \\not \\equiv j \\pm 1(\\bmod n)$ implies that for any two boxes to intersect, their indices must be at least two apart modulo $n$.\nStep 6:  We can start by placing the first box $B_{1}$ at the origin, and then place the subsequent boxes $B_{2}, B_{3}, \\ldots, B_{n}$ in a way that they satisfy the given condition.\nStep 7:  We can place $B_{2}$ at $(1,0)$, $B_{3}$ at $(0,1)$, $B_{4}$ at $(-1,0)$, and so on, alternating the positions of the boxes in a way that they satisfy the condition.\nStep 8:  By doing this, we can ensure that any two boxes intersect if and only if their indices are not consecutive modulo $n$.\nStep 9:  This arrangement allows us to visualize the boxes and understand how they intersect based on their indices.\nStep 10:  Now, we need to find the largest $n$ for which this arrangement is possible.\nStep 11:  To do this, we can consider the number of boxes that can be placed in the plane while satisfying the given condition.\nStep 12:  By analyzing the arrangement of the boxes, we can determine the largest value of $n$ for which this is possible.\nStep 13:  This will give us the maximum number of boxes that can be placed in the plane while satisfying the given condition.\nStep 14:  Therefore, we need to find the largest $n$ for which the arrangement of boxes satisfies the condition $i \\not \\equiv j \\pm 1(\\bmod n)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$",

We are interested in finding the number of $k$-step sequences that end with lamps $1$ through $n$ being on and lamps $n+1$ through $2n$ being off.\n## Step 2:  We are also asked to find the number of $k$-step sequences that lead to the same state but do not touch lamps $n+1$ through $2n$ at all. Let's denote the number of such sequences as $M$.\n## Step 3:  To approach this problem, we can use the concept of permutations and combinations. We can think of the $k$-step sequences as a series of operations where we switch the state of a lamp from on to off or from off to on.\n## Step 4:  We can represent the $k$-step sequences as a string of $k$ letters, where each letter corresponds to the operation performed on a lamp. For example, if we have a sequence of operations that switches lamp 1 on, lamp 2 off, lamp 3 on, and so on, we can represent it as the string \"101010...\". This string has $k$ letters, and each letter corresponds to the operation performed on a lamp.\n## Step 5:  We can then use the concept of permutations and combinations to count the number of such strings. We need to consider the number of ways to arrange the letters in the string, taking into account the constraints given in the problem.\n## Step 6:  We can use the formula for combinations to count the number of ways to choose the positions of the lamps that are switched on, and then use the formula for permutations to count the number of ways to arrange the letters in the string.\n## Step 7:  By using these formulas, we can calculate the number of $k$-step sequences that satisfy the given conditions and find the ratio $N/M$.\n## Step 8:  We can then simplify the expression for the ratio $N/M$ to obtain the final answer.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2^{n}}}$",
  "Step 1:  The problem asks us to find all functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the given functional equation and the condition $f(-1) \\neq 0$.\nStep 2:  To start, we can plug in specific values for $x$ and $y$ to simplify the functional equation and gain insights into the properties of the function $f$.\nStep 3:  First, let's set $x = y = 0$ in the given functional equation. This gives us $f(0) - f(0) = f(0)^2$, which simplifies to $f(0)^2 = 0$. Therefore, we find that $f(0) = 0$.\nStep 4:  Next, we set $y = 0$ in the functional equation, which gives us $f(1 + x \\cdot 0) - f(x + 0) = f(x) f(0)$. Simplifying this, we get $f(1) - f(x) = 0$, which leads to $f(x) = f(1)$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nStep 5:  Now, we set $x = 1$ in the functional equation, which gives us $f(1 + y) - f(1 + y) = f(1) f(y)$. This simplifies to $0 = f(1) f(y)$, and since $f(-1) \\neq 0$, we conclude that $f(1) = 0$.\nStep 6:  Therefore, we have found that $f(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nStep 7:  Hence, the function $f(x) = 0$ satisfies the given functional equation and the condition $f(-1) \\neq 0$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of disjoint pairs of elements from the set $\\{1,2, \\ldots, n\\}$ such that the sums of the different pairs are different integers not exceeding $n$.\nStep 2:  We can start by considering the possible pairs of elements from the set. Since the sums of the pairs should be different integers not exceeding $n$, we can think of pairing the smallest element with the largest element, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on.\nStep 3:  However, we need to ensure that the sums of the pairs are distinct. This means that we cannot pair the smallest element with the largest element, as their sum would be $n$, which is the same for all pairs.\nStep 4:  Therefore, we can pair the smallest element with the second largest, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on, until we reach the middle of the set.\nStep 5:  This way, we can create pairs with distinct sums, and we can continue this process until we have used up all the elements in the set.\nStep 6:  The maximum number of disjoint pairs we can form will be equal to the number of pairs we can create using this method.\nStep 7:  To find the maximum number of pairs, we can use the formula $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor$, where $\\left\\lfloor x \\right\\rfloor$ represents the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the maximum number of disjoint pairs of elements from the set $\\{1,2, \\ldots, n\\}$ such that the sums of the different pairs are different integers not exceeding $n$ is $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor}$",

There are $999 \\times 999$ possible choices for $C_{1}$.\nStep 4:  Next, we need to choose the second cell, $C_{2}$, which must be red. Since $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ are in the same row, there are $998 \\times 999$ possible choices for $C_{2}$.\nStep 5:  Then, we need to choose the third cell, $C_{3}$, which must be white. Since $C_{2}$ and $C_{3}$ are in the same column, there are $999 \\times 998$ possible choices for $C_{3}$.\nStep 6:  However, we need to account for the fact that the order of choosing $C_{1}$, $C_{2}$, and $C_{3}$ does not matter. This means that we have counted each valid triple three times, so we need to divide the total count by $3$ to avoid overcounting.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the maximum value of $T$ can be calculated as $\\frac{999 \\times 999 \\times 998 \\times 999 \\times 998}{3}$.\nStep 8:  By simplifying this expression, we can find the maximum value of $T$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{199999800199}$",

Player B then makes moves by passing 1 coin from every box to an adjacent box, and player A makes moves by choosing several coins from different boxes and passing them to adjacent boxes. The goal of player A is to ensure that there is at least 1 coin in each box after every move of hers, regardless of how player B plays and how many moves are made.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the minimum number of coins required for player A to succeed\nTo ensure that there is at least 1 coin in each box after every move of hers, player A needs to have a certain number of coins in each box. Since there are 2012 boxes, player A needs to have at least 2012 coins in total to ensure that each box has at least 1 coin.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the moves of player B and how they affect the number of coins in each box\nWhen player B makes a move, he passes 1 coin from every box to an adjacent box. This means that the number of coins in each box decreases by 1. However, since there are 2012 boxes, the total number of coins remains the same.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the minimum number of coins required for player A to succeed after player B's move\nAfter player B's move, each box will have one less coin than before. However, since player A needs to ensure that there is at least 1 coin in each box, she needs to have at least 2012 coins in total to compensate for the decrease in coins in each box.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the moves of player A and how they affect the number of coins in each box\nWhen player A makes a move, she chooses several coins from different boxes and passes them to adjacent boxes. This means that the number of coins in each box can increase or decrease, depending on the number of coins chosen by player A.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the minimum number of coins required for player A to succeed after her move\nSince player A needs to ensure that there is at least 1 coin in each box after every move of hers, she needs to have at least 2012 coins in total to compensate for any decrease in coins in each box.\n\n## Step 7: Consider the minimum number of coins required for player A to succeed after multiple moves\nSince player A needs to ensure that there is at least 1 coin in each box after every move of hers, she needs to have at least 2012 coins in total to compensate for any decrease in coins in each box, regardless of how many moves are made.\n\n## Step 8: Determine the least N that enables player A to succeed\nBased on the analysis above, the least N that enables player A to succeed is 2012.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2012}$",

  "To solve this problem, we need to consider the conditions given and find the minimum number of blue cells required to satisfy them.\n\n## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe have a $4m \\times 4m$ array of square unit cells, where $m$ is a positive integer. Two cells are related if they are in the same row or column, and no cell is related to itself. We need to find the minimum number of blue cells such that every cell is related to at least two blue cells.\n\n## Step 2: Consider the minimum number of blue cells per row\nSince every cell must be related to at least two blue cells, each row must have at least two blue cells. If a row has only one blue cell, then the cells in that row would not be related to at least two blue cells.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the minimum number of blue cells per column\nSimilarly, each column must also have at least two blue cells. If a column has only one blue cell, then the cells in that column would not be related to at least two blue cells.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the minimum number of blue cells\nTo satisfy the conditions, we need to have at least two blue cells in each row and each column. This means that we need at least $2m$ blue cells in each row and each column.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the total minimum number of blue cells\nSince we have $4m$ rows and $4m$ columns, the total minimum number of blue cells required is $2m \\times 4m = 8m^2$.\n\n## Step 6: Consider the case when m = 1\nWhen $m = 1$, the array is a $4 \\times 4$ grid. In this case, we can have two blue cells in each row and each column, which satisfies the conditions.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the minimum number of blue cells for m = 1\nFor $m = 1$, the minimum number of blue cells is $2 \\times 4 = 8$.\n\n## Step 8: Consider the case when m > 1\nWhen $m > 1$, we can have two blue cells in each row and each column, which satisfies the conditions.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the minimum number of blue cells for m > 1\nFor $m > 1$, the minimum number of blue cells is $2m \\times 4m = 8m^2$.\n\n## Step 10: Determine the minimum number of blue cells\nSince the minimum number of blue cells is $8m^2$ for $m > 1$, and $8$ for $m = 1$, the minimum number of blue cells is $8$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$",

next terms of the sequence.\nStep 7:  We find that $a_{4}=m(m+1)-1$, $a_{5}=m(m+1)(m-1)$, and $a_{6}=m(m+1)(m^2-2m-1)$.\nStep 8:  We observe that for $a_{4}$ to be a square, $m(m+1)-1$ must be a square, and for $a_{5}$ to be a square, $m(m+1)(m-1)$ must be a square.\nStep 9:  We can then use these conditions to derive relationships between $m$ and the terms of the sequence.\nStep 10:  By analyzing the relationships between $m$ and the terms of the sequence, we can determine the possible values of $m$ that satisfy the condition that every term of the sequence is a square.\nStep 11:  We can then use these relationships to find the values of $m$ that make every term of the sequence a square.\nStep 12:  By considering the cases where $m$ is even and odd, we can further narrow down the

  "Step 1:  The problem presents us with a system of equations involving three real numbers $a, b,$ and $c.$ We are given the equations $ab + bc + ca = 1$ and $a^2 b + c = b^2 c + a = c^2 a + b.$\nStep 2:  To begin solving this problem, we can start by manipulating the given equations to simplify and eventually solve for the values of $a, b,$ and $c.$\nStep 3:  We can start by subtracting $ab + bc + ca = 1$ from the other two equations to obtain $a^2 b - ab^2 + c - b^2 c = 0$ and $c^2 a - ca^2 + b - c^2 a = 0.$\nStep 4:  Factoring out common terms, we get $ab(a - b) + c(1 - b^2) = 0$ and $ca(c - a) + b(1 - c^2) = 0.$\nStep 5:  We can then rearrange these equations to obtain $ab(a - b) = c(1 - b^2)$ and $ca(c - a) = b(1 - c^2).$\nStep 6:  Dividing the first equation by the second, we get $\\frac{ab(a - b)}{ca(c - a)} = \\frac{c(1 - b^2)}{b(1 - c^2)}.$\nStep 7:  Simplifying this expression, we find that $\\frac{a}{c} = \\frac{1 - b^2}{1 - c^2}.$\nStep 8:  We can then substitute this expression into the equation $ab(a - b) = c(1 - b^2)$ to obtain $a^2 b - ab^2 = c(1 - b^2).$\nStep 9:  Similarly, we can substitute $\\frac{c}{b} = \\frac{1 - a^2}{1 - c^2}$ into the equation $ca(c - a) = b(1 - c^2)$ to obtain $c^2 a - ca^2 = b(1 - c^2).$\nStep 10:  By manipulating these equations, we can eventually solve for the values of $a, b,$ and $c.$\nStep 11:  After simplifying and solving the equations, we find that the only possible solution is $a = b = c = 1.$\nStep 12:  Therefore, the only triple of real numbers that satisfies the given equations is $(1, 1, 1).$\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the conditions for placing dominoes on a $2n \\times 2n$ board. Each domino must cover exactly two cells, and no two dominoes can overlap.\nStep 2:  We are given that every cell of the board is adjacent to exactly one cell covered by a domino. This means that each cell is covered by a domino, and there are no uncovered cells.\nStep 3:  The problem asks us to find the largest number of dominoes that can be placed in this way for each positive integer $n$.\nStep 4:  We can start by considering the number of cells in the $2n \\times 2n$ board, which is $(2n)^2 = 4n^2$.\nStep 5:  Since each domino covers exactly two cells, the total number of dominoes that can be placed on the board is half the total number of cells, which is $\\frac{4n^2}{2} = 2n^2$.\nStep 6:  However, we need to consider the parity of $n$. If $n$ is even, then the board can be divided into $n^2$ squares of size $2 \\times 2$, and each square can be covered by one domino. This means that the maximum number of dominoes that can be placed is $n^2$.\nStep 7:  On the other hand, if $n$ is odd, then the board cannot be divided into $n^2$ squares of size $2 \\times 2$. In this case, we can cover all the cells of the board with dominoes, but we will have one cell left uncovered. This means that the maximum number of dominoes that can be placed is $n^2$ as well.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the largest number of dominoes that can be placed on the $2n \\times 2n$ board is $n^2$ for both even and odd values of $n$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{n^2}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between Serge's paddling speed, the speed of the current, and the time it takes him to travel from point $A$ to point $B$.\nStep 2:  Let's denote Serge's paddling speed as $p$ and the speed of the current as $c$. When Serge paddles with the current, his effective speed is $p + c$, and it takes him 18 minutes to travel from $A$ to $B$. This can be represented by the equation $\\frac{d}{p + c} = 18$, where $d$ is the distance between points $A$ and $B$.\nStep 3:  On the other hand, when Serge paddles against the current, his effective speed is $p - c$, and it takes him 30 minutes to travel from $A$ to $B$. This can be represented by the equation $\\frac{d}{p - c} = 30$.\nStep 4:  We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of $p$ and $c$. By multiplying both sides of the first equation by $p + c$ and both sides of the second equation by $p - c$, we get $d = 18(p + c)$ and $d = 30(p - c)$.\nStep 5:  Equating these two expressions for $d$, we have $18(p + c) = 30(p - c)$. Simplifying this equation, we get $18p + 18c = 30p - 30c$.\nStep 6:  Rearranging the terms, we find $48c = 12p$, which simplifies to $4c = p$.\nStep 7:  Now, we need to find the time it would take Serge to paddle from $A$ to $B$ if there were no current. This can be represented by the equation $\\frac{d}{p} = t$, where $t$ is the time taken.\nStep 8:  Substituting the value of $p$ in terms of $c$, we get $\\frac{d}{4c} = t$. Since we know that $d = 18(p + c)$, we can substitute this expression for $d$ to get $\\frac{18(p + c)}{4c} = t$.\nStep 9:  Simplifying this expression, we find $\\frac{18p + 18c}{4c} = t$, which further simplifies to $\\frac{18p}{4c} + \\frac{18c}{4c} = t$.\nStep 10:  Substituting the value of $p$ in terms of $c$, we get $\\frac{18(4c)}{4c} + \\frac{18c}{4c} = t$, which simplifies to $18 + 4.5 = t$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the time it would take Serge to paddle from $A$ to $B$ if there were no current is $t = 22.5$ minutes.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{22.5}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first understand the given information and what is being asked. We have a square $O P Q R$ with vertices $O(0,0), P(0,8), Q(8,8)$, and $R(8,0)$. The parabola with equation $y=a(x-2)(x-6)$ intersects the sides of the square at points $K, L, M$, and $N$. We are required to find all the values of $a$ for which the area of the trapezoid $K L M N$ is 36.\nStep 2:  The first step is to find the coordinates of the points $K, L, M$, and $N$. We can do this by substituting the $x$-coordinates of the sides of the square into the equation of the parabola to find the corresponding $y$-coordinates.\nStep 3:  For the side $OP$, the $x$-coordinate is 0, so we substitute $x=0$ into the equation of the parabola to get $y=a(0-2)(0-6)=-12a$. This gives us the $y$-coordinate of point $K$ as $8=-12a$, which leads to $a=-\\frac{2}{3}$.\nStep 4:  Similarly, for the side $OQ$, the $x$-coordinate is 8, so we substitute $x=8$ into the equation of the parabola to get $y=a(8-2)(8-6)=24a$. This gives us the $y$-coordinate of point $L$ as $8=24a$, which leads to $a=\\frac{1}{3}$.\nStep 5:  For the side $QR$, the $x$-coordinate is 8, so we substitute $x=8$ into the equation of the parabola to get $y=a(8-2)(8-6)=24a$. This gives us the $y$-coordinate of point $M$ as $0=24a$, which leads to $a=0$.\nStep 6:  For the side $RP$, the $x$-coordinate is 0, so we substitute $x=0$ into the equation of the parabola to get $y=a(0-2)(0-6)=-12a$. This gives us the $y$-coordinate of point $N$ as $0=-12a$, which leads to $a=0$.\nStep 7:  Now that we have the coordinates of the points $K, L, M$, and $N$, we can use the formula for the area of a trapezoid to find the area of $K L M N$ in terms of $a$.\nStep 8:  The formula for the area of a trapezoid is $\\frac{1}{2}h(b_1+b_2)$, where $h$ is the height and $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the lengths of the parallel sides.\nStep 9:  We can calculate the area of the trapezoid $K L M N$ using the coordinates of the points $K, L, M$, and $N$.\nStep 10:  After finding the area of the trapezoid in terms of $a$, we can set it equal to 36 and solve for $a$ to find the values of $a$ for which the area of the trapezoid is 36.\nStep 11:  By solving the equation $a^2(8+24)=36$, we can find the values of $a$ that satisfy the condition.\nStep 12:  Therefore, we can find the values of $a$ for which the area of the trapezoid $K L M N$ is 36.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\left\\{ -\\frac{2}{3}, \\  \\frac{1}{3}\\right\\}}",
  "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Understand the given probabilities\nWe are given the following probabilities:\n- A 75-year-old person has a 50% chance of living at least another 10 years.\n- A 75-year-old person has a 20% chance of living at least another 15 years.\n- An 80-year-old person has a 25% chance of living at least another 10 years.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the relationship between living at least 10 years and living at least 15 years for a 75-year-old\nSince a 75-year-old person has a 50% chance of living at least another 10 years and a 20% chance of living at least another 15 years, it implies that living at least 15 years is a subset of living at least 10 years. This is because if someone lives at least 15 years, they automatically live at least 10 years.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the relationship between living at least 10 years and living at least 5 years for an 80-year-old\nWe need to find the probability that an 80-year-old person will live at least another 5 years. Since living at least 10 years is a subset of living at least 5 years, the probability of living at least 10 years is greater than or equal to the probability of living at least 5 years.\n\n## Step 4: Use the given probabilities to find the probability of living at least 10 years for an 80-year-old\nWe are given that an 80-year-old person has a 25% chance of living at least another 10 years.\n\n## Step 5: Use the relationship between living at least 10 years and living at least 5 years to find the probability of living at least 5 years for an 80-year-old\nSince living at least 10 years is a subset of living at least 5 years, the probability of living at least 10 years is greater than or equal to the probability of living at least 5 years. However, we cannot directly use the given probabilities to find the probability of living at least 5 years. We need to use the fact that the probability of living at least 5 years is greater than or equal to the probability of living at least 10 years.\n\n## Step 6: Use the fact that the probability of living at least 5 years is greater than or equal to the probability of living at least 10 years to find the lower bound of the probability of living at least 5 years\nSince the probability of living at least 10 years is 25%, the probability of living at least 5 years is greater than or equal to 25%.\n\n## Step 7: Use the fact that the probability of living at least 5 years is less than or equal to 1 to find the upper bound of the probability of living at least 5 years\nThe probability of living at least 5 years is less than or equal to 1.\n\n## Step 8: Use the lower and upper bounds to find the final answer\nSince we cannot find the exact probability of living at least 5 years, we can only give a range of possible values. However, the problem asks for a single numerical answer, so we will assume that the probability of living at least 5 years is the lower bound of the range, which is 25%.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0.25}$",
  "Step 1:  The given equation involves logarithmic and exponential functions, and we need to solve for the values of $x$ that satisfy the equation.\nStep 2:  The first step is to simplify the given equation by using the properties of logarithms and exponents.

We can start by trying different values of $k$ and checking if the corresponding value of $n$ is a positive integer.\nStep 10:  We can start by trying $k = 0$, which gives us $n = \\frac{0+100}{2} = 50$. Since $n$ is a positive integer, this is a valid solution.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the value of $n$ for which $f(n) = 100$ is $n = \\boxed{50}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{50}$",

This information allows us to find the value of $c$ in the equation of the parabola.\nStep 3:  The vertex form of a parabola is given by $y=a(x-h)^{2}+k$, where $(h,k)$ is the vertex. In this case, the vertex is $(1,18)$, so we can write the equation as $y=-2(x-1)^{2}+18$.\nStep 4:  To find the value of $c$, we can substitute the vertex coordinates into the equation $y=-2x^{2}+4x+c$. This gives us $18=-2(1)^{2}+4(1)+c$, which simplifies to $c=16$.\nStep 5:  Now that we have the value of $c$, we can find the coordinates of points D, E, and F. The $y$-intercept, point D, occurs when $x=0$, so substituting $x=0$ into the equation gives us $y=-2(0)^{2}+4(0)+16=16$.

Additionally, the sum of all $n$ terms is 1000.\nStep 5:  We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence, which is $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$, where $S_n$ is the sum of the first $n$ terms, $a_1$ is the first term, and $a_n$ is the last term.\nStep 6:  We can also use the formula for the $k$th term of an arithmetic sequence, which is $a_k = a_1 + (k-1)d$, where $a_k$ is the $k$th term, $a_1$ is the first term, $k$ is the term number, and $d$ is the common difference.\nStep 7:  We are given that $t_{3}=5$ and $t_{n-2}=95$, so we can use these values to find the common difference $d$.\nStep 8:  We can then use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence to find the value of $n$.\n\nStep 9:  First, let's find the common difference $d$ using the given values of $t_{3}$ and $t_{n-2}$.\nStep 10:  We know that $t_{3}=5$ and $t_{n-2}=95$, so we can use the formula for the $k$th term of an arithmetic sequence to find the common difference $d$.\nStep 11:  We have $t_{3}=a_1 + 2d = 5$ and $t_{n-2}=a_1 + (n-3)d = 95$.\nStep 12:  Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get $(n-3)d - 2d = 90$, which simplifies to $(n-5)d = 90$.\nStep 13:  We can then solve for $d$ in terms of $n$.\n\nStep 14:  Next, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence to find the value of $n$.\nStep 15:  We know that the sum of all $n$ terms is 1000, so we can use the formula $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$ to find the value of $n$.\nStep 16:  We have $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n) = 1000$, and we can substitute the values of $a_1$ and $a_n$ in terms of $n$ and $d$.\nStep 17:  We can then solve for $n$.\n\nStep 18:  Now, let's find the value of $n$.\nStep 19:  We have $(n-5)d = 90$, and we can solve for $d$ in terms of $n$.\nStep 20:  We get $d = \\frac{90}{n-5}$.\nStep 21:  We can then substitute this value of $d$ into the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence.\nStep 22:  We have $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n) = 1000$, and we can substitute the values of $a_1$ and $a_n$ in terms of $n$ and $d$.\nStep 23:  We get $\\frac{n}{2}\\left(a_1 + a_1 + (n-1)d\\right) = 1000$.\nStep 24:  Substituting the value of $d$, we get $\\frac{n}{2}\\left(a_1 + a_1 + (n-1)\\frac{90}{n-5}\\right) = 1000$.\nStep 25:  Simplifying, we get $\\frac{n}{2}\\left(2a_1 + \\frac{90n-90}{n-5}\\right) = 1000$.\nStep 26:  We can then solve for $n$.\n\nStep 27:  After solving the equation, we find that $n=31$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{31}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve the given system of equations, we first need to simplify each equation by applying the properties of logarithms.\nStep 2:  The first equation is $(\\log x)(\\log y)-3 \\log 5 y-\\log 8 x = a$. We can rewrite this as $\\log x + \\log y - 3 \\log 5 - \\log 8 - \\log x = a$.\nStep 3:  Simplifying further, we get $\\log y - 3 \\log 5 - \\log 8 = a$. We can then express this as $\\log \\frac{y}{8 \\cdot 5^3} = a$.\nStep 4:  Similarly, the second equation can be simplified to $\\log \\frac{z}{16 \\cdot 5^4} = b$, and the third equation simplifies to $\\log \\frac{x}{8 \\cdot 625^4} = c$.\nStep 5:  Now, we can express $x$, $y$, and $z$ in terms of $a$, $b$, and $c$ using the properties of logarithms.\nStep 6:  We have $x = 8 \\cdot 625^4 \\cdot 10^c$, $y = 8 \\cdot 5^3 \\cdot 10^a$, and $z = 16 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 10^b$.\nStep 7:  Substituting the given values of $a=-4$, $b=4$, and $c=-18$ into these expressions, we can find the values of $x$, $y$, and $z$.\nStep 8:  After substituting the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$, we get $x = 8 \\cdot 625^4 \\cdot 10^{-18}$, $y = 8 \\cdot 5^3 \\cdot 10^{-4}$, and $z = 16 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 10^4$.\nStep 9:  Simplifying these expressions, we find $x = 8 \\cdot 5^{16} \\cdot 10^{-18}$, $y = 8 \\cdot 5^3 \\cdot 10^{-4}$, and $z = 16 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 10^4$.\nStep 10:  Further simplifying, we get $x = 2^{-7} \\cdot 5^{16} \\cdot 10^{-18}$, $y = 2^3 \\cdot 5^3 \\cdot 10^{-4}$, and $z = 2^4 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 10^4$.\nStep 11:  Finally, we can express $x$, $y$, and $z$ in terms of $2$ and $5$ to obtain the final values.\nStep 12:  After simplifying, we find $x = 2^{-7} \\cdot 5^{16} \\cdot 10^{-18} = \\frac{5^{16}}{2^7 \\cdot 10^{18}}$, $y = 2^3 \\cdot 5^3 \\cdot 10^{-4} = \\frac{2^3 \\cdot 5^3}{10^4}$, and $z = 2^4 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 10^4 = 2^4 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 10^4$.\nStep 13:  Therefore, the values of $x$, $y$, and $z$ are $\\frac{5^{16}}{2^7 \\cdot 10^{18}}$, $\\frac{2^3 \\cdot 5^3}{10^4}$, and $2^4 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 10^4$ respectively.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2^4 \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 10^4}$",
  "Step 1:  To find the probability that the product of the two numbers on the top faces of the two dice is divisible by 5, we need to consider all the possible outcomes when the two dice are thrown.\nStep 2:  Each die has 6 faces, so when two dice are thrown, the total number of possible outcomes is $6 \\times 6 = 36$.\nStep 3:  Now, we need to determine the number of outcomes where the product of the two numbers on the top faces is divisible by 5.\nStep 4:  For the product to be divisible by 5, at least one of the numbers on the top faces must be a multiple of 5. This means we need to count the number of outcomes where at least one of the numbers is a 5.\nStep 5:  There are 6 possible outcomes where the first die shows a 5, and for each of these outcomes, there are 6 possible outcomes for the second die. This gives us a total of $6 \\times 6 = 36$ outcomes where the first die shows a 5.\nStep 6:  Similarly, there are 6 possible outcomes where the second die shows a 5, and for each of these outcomes, there are 6 possible outcomes for the first die. This also gives us a total of $6 \\times 6 = 36$ outcomes where the second die shows a 5.\nStep 7:  However, we have counted the outcome where both dice show a 5 twice, so we need to subtract 1 from the total count to avoid double counting.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the total number of outcomes where the product of the two numbers on the top faces is divisible by 5 is $36 + 36 - 1 = 71$.\nStep 9:  Finally, to find the probability, we divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes, which gives us $\\frac{71}{36}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{71}{36}}$",

Since the sequence is of order 4, the first element can be any of the numbers 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n## Step 6:  If $s_1 = 1$, then the next element $s_2$ must be 2, as there must be exactly two elements equal to 1.

This means that each integer from 1 to $n$ appears exactly twice in the sequence.\nStep 3:  The second condition states that if $s_{i}=s_{j}=k$ with $i<j$, then $j-i=k$.

This means that the ones digit can only be $1, 3, 5, 7,$ or $9$ since an odd number must end in an odd digit.\nStep 2:  Additionally, we know that the hundreds digit of $m$ equals the product of the tens digit and ones digit of $m$. This gives us a relationship between the digits of the number.\nStep 3:  We can start by considering the possible values for the ones digit, which are $1, 3, 5, 7,$ or $9$. We then need to find the corresponding tens digit for each of these values.\nStep 4:  If the ones digit is $1$, then the tens digit must be $1$ as well, but this would result in a number with repeated digits, which is not allowed. So, we can rule out the case where the ones digit is $1$.\nStep 5:  If the ones digit is $3$, then the tens digit must be $1$, but again, this would result in a number with repeated digits. So, we can rule out the case where the ones digit is $3$.\nStep 6:  If the ones digit is $5$, then the tens digit must be $1$, but this would also result in a number with repeated digits. So, we can rule out the case where the ones digit is $5$.\nStep 7:  If the ones digit is $7$, then the tens digit must be $1$, but this would again result in a number with repeated digits. So, we can rule out the case where the ones digit is $7$.\nStep 8:  If the ones digit is $9$, then the tens digit must be $1$, but this would result in a number with repeated digits. So, we can rule out the case where the ones digit is $9$.\nStep 9:  However, if the ones digit is $3$, then the tens digit must be $7$, and the hundreds digit must be the product of the tens and ones digits, which is $7 \\times 3 = 21$. But $21$ is not a valid digit for the hundreds place, so we can rule out the case where the ones digit is $3$.\nStep 10:  If the ones digit is $5$, then the tens digit must be $7$, and the hundreds digit must be the product of the tens and ones digits, which is $7 \\times 5 = 35$.

Then, the number of gold marbles would be $4x$.\nStep 3:  Since the total number of marbles is 100, we can set up the equation $x + 4x = 100$ to represent the total number of marbles.\nStep 4:  Solving for $x$, we get $5x = 100$, which gives us $x = 20$.

However, when Bianca plays Dave, the probability that she wins is $1-p$, where $p$ is the probability that Dave wins against her.\nStep 3:  Now, let's consider the different ways in which Bianca can win the tournament. There are two possible scenarios: (1) Bianca wins the first match against Alain or Chen, and then wins the second match against Dave, or (2) Bianca loses the first match against Alain or Chen, but wins the second match against the other player, and then wins the third match against Dave.\nStep 4:  In the first scenario, the probability that Bianca wins the first match is $\\frac{1}{2}$, and the probability that she wins the second match is $1-p$.

  "Step 1:  The problem presents a scenario where Kerry has a list of $n$ integers, and she calculates the pairwise sums of all possible pairs of integers in her list. The list of pairwise sums is then ordered in ascending order.\nStep 2:  We are given that $n=4$ and the 6 pairwise sums are $s_{1}=8, s_{2}=104, s_{3}=106$, $s_{4}=110, s_{5}=112$, and $s_{6}=208$. We need to determine two possible lists $(a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, a_{4})$ that Kerry could have.\nStep 3:  To approach this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the pairwise sums and the original list of integers. The key insight is that the pairwise sums can be expressed as the sum of two elements from the list. For example, the sum $s_{1}=8$ can be expressed as $a_{1}+a_{2}$, $a_{1}+a_{3}$, or $a_{1}+a_{4}$.\nStep 4:  We can use this relationship to determine the possible values of the original list of integers. We can start by analyzing the smallest pairwise sum, which is $s_{1}=8$. This sum can be expressed as $a_{1}+a_{2}$, $a_{1}+a_{3}$, or $a_{1}+a_{4}$. Since the list is ordered, the smallest possible value for $a_{1}$ is 1, and the next smallest value is 2. Therefore, we can deduce that $a_{1}=1$ and $a_{2}=2$.\nStep 5:  Moving on to the next pairwise sum, $s_{2}=104$, we can express it as $a_{1}+a_{3}$ or $a_{2}+a_{4}$. Since $a_{1}=1$ and $a_{2}=2$, we can deduce that $a_{3}=103$ and $a_{4}=101$.\nStep 6:  Alternatively, we can also express $s_{2}=104$ as $a_{1}+a_{4}$ or $a_{2}+a_{3}$. In this case, we can deduce that $a_{1}=3$, $a_{2}=4$, $a_{3}=100$, and $a_{4}=101$.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the two possible lists $(a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, a_{4})$ that Kerry could have are $(1,2,103,101)$ and $(3,4,100,101)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\left( 1, \\  2, \\  103, \\  101\\right)}",

This gives us a total of $2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 8$ possible combinations of exponents.\nStep 7:  Therefore, there are $\\boxed{8}$ positive divisors of 900 that are perfect squares.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of an isosceles triangle and how the given information about the angles and coordinates of the points can help us find the possible values of $k$.\nStep 2:  First, we recall that in an isosceles triangle, the two sides that are equal in length are called the legs, and the third side is called the base. In this case, we're given that $\\angle ABC = \\angle ACB$, which means that the triangle is isosceles.\nStep 3:  We're also given the coordinates of points $A(k, 3)$, $B(3,1)$, and $C(6, k)$. We can use the distance formula to find the lengths of the sides of the triangle.\nStep 4:  The distance formula is given by $d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$. We can use this formula to find the lengths of $AB$, $AC$, and $BC$.\nStep 5:  We find that $AB = \\sqrt{(3 - k)^2 + (1 - 3)^2} = \\sqrt{(3 - k)^2 + 4}$, $AC = \\sqrt{(6 - k)^2 + (k - 3)^2}$, and $BC = \\sqrt{(6 - 3)^2 + (k - 1)^2} = \\sqrt{9 + (k - 1)^2}$.\nStep 6:  Since $\\triangle ABC$ is isosceles, we have $AB = AC$. This gives us the equation $\\sqrt{(3 - k)^2 + 4} = \\sqrt{(6 - k)^2 + (k - 3)^2}$.\nStep 7:  We can square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square roots and simplify the equation to find the possible values of $k$.\nStep 8:  After simplifying the equation, we get $k^2 - 6k + 5 = 0$. We can solve this quadratic equation to find the values of $k$.\nStep 9:  The quadratic equation $k^2 - 6k + 5 = 0$ can be factored as $(k - 5)(k - 1) = 0$. This gives us the solutions $k = 5$ and $k = 1$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the possible values of $k$ are $k = 5$ and $k = 1$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to determine the amount of acid in each of the original mixtures from bottles A, B, and C.\nStep 2:  For bottle A, which contains $40 \\mathrm{~g}$ of the mixture with $10 \\%$ acid, we calculate the amount of acid as $40 \\times 0.1 = 4 \\mathrm{~g}$.\nStep 3:  Similarly, for bottle B, with $50 \\mathrm{~g}$ of the mixture containing $20 \\%$ acid, the amount of acid is $50 \\times 0.2 = 10 \\mathrm{~g}$.\nStep 4:  For bottle C, which contains $50 \\mathrm{~g}$ of the mixture with $30 \\%$ acid, the amount of acid is $50 \\times 0.3 = 15 \\mathrm{~g}$.\nStep 5:  Next, we need to find the amount of acid in the mixture created by combining some of the mixture from each of the bottles to create a $60 \\mathrm{~g}$ mixture with $25 \\%$ acid. This means the amount of acid in this new mixture is $60 \\times 0.25 = 15 \\mathrm{~g}$.\nStep 6:  Now, we can calculate the amount of the mixture from each bottle that was used to create this new mixture. Let's denote the amount of mixture from bottle A as $x$, from bottle B as $y$, and from bottle C as $z$.\nStep 7:  We know that the total mass of the new mixture is $60 \\mathrm{~g}$, so we have the equation $x + y + z = 60$.\nStep 8:  Additionally, we know that the total amount of acid in the new mixture is $15 \\mathrm{~g}$, so we have the equation $0.1x + 0.2y + 0.3z = 15$.\nStep 9:  We can solve this system of equations to find the values of $x$, $y$, and $z$.\nStep 10:  Once we have the values of $x$, $y$, and $z$, we can calculate the amount of acid in the remaining contents of each bottle by subtracting the amount used from the original amount.\nStep 11:  Finally, we can calculate the total amount of acid in the new mixture by adding the amounts of acid from the remaining contents of each bottle.\nStep 12:  We can then calculate the percentage of acid in the new mixture by dividing the total amount of acid by the total mass of the new mixture and multiplying by $100$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{28}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first understand the given information and what is being asked. We are told that there are 40 balls in a bag, and each ball is either black or gold. Feridun randomly removes two balls from the bag, and we are given that the probability of removing two gold balls is $\\frac{5}{12}$.\nStep 2:  Let's denote the number of gold balls as $g$. Since there are 40 balls in total, the number of black balls would be $40 - g$.\nStep 3:  The probability of drawing two gold balls can be calculated using combinations. The number of ways to choose 2 gold balls from $g$ gold balls is given by $\\binom{g}{2}$, and the total number of ways to choose 2 balls from 40 is $\\binom{40}{2}$.\nStep 4:  Therefore, the probability of drawing two gold balls is $\\frac{\\binom{g}{2}}{\\binom{40}{2}} = \\frac{5}{12}$.\nStep 5:  We can simplify this equation to $\\frac{g(g-1)}{2} \\cdot \\frac{2}{40 \\cdot 39} = \\frac{5}{12}$.\nStep 6:  Multiplying both sides by $40 \\cdot 39$ to clear the denominators, we get $g(g-1) = \\frac{5}{12} \\cdot 40 \\cdot 39$.\nStep 7:  Simplifying further, we have $g(g-1) = 650$.\nStep 8:  We can solve this quadratic equation to find the value of $g$.\nStep 9:  The quadratic equation $g^2 - g - 650 = 0$ can be factored as $(g-26)(g+25) = 0$.\nStep 10:  This gives us two possible solutions: $g = 26$ or $g = -25$. However, since the number of gold balls cannot be negative, we discard the solution $g = -25$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the number of gold balls in the bag is $\\boxed{26}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{26}$",

  "Let $f(n)$ be the number of positive integers that have exactly $n$ digits and whose digits have a sum of 5. We claim that $f(n)$ is the number of ways to arrange $n$ 1's and $4$'s in a row, which is $\\binom{n+4}{4}$.\nTo prove this, we can use induction. For the base case, we have $f(1)=5$ because the only positive integers with exactly one digit and a sum of 5 are 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1. We can arrange one 1 and four 0's in a row in $\\binom{1+4}{4}=\\binom{5}{4}=5$ ways, so the base case holds.\nFor the inductive step, we assume that $f(n)=\\binom{n+4}{4}$ for some positive integer $n$. We need to show that $f(n+1)=\\binom{(n+1)+4}{4}=\\binom{n+5}{4}$. We can construct a positive integer with exactly $n+1$ digits and a sum of 5 by appending a 1 to a positive integer with exactly $n$ digits and a sum of 4. There are $f(n)$ such positive integers, so there are $f(n)$ ways to choose the $n$-digit positive integer. For each of these choices, we can append a 1 in $n+1$ ways, so there are $f(n)(n+1)$ ways to construct a positive integer with exactly $n+1$ digits and a sum of 5. However, we can also construct a positive integer with exactly $n+1$ digits and a sum of 5 by appending a 4 to a positive integer with exactly $n$ digits and a sum of 1. There are $f(n)$ such positive integers, so there are $f(n)$ ways to choose the $n$-digit positive integer. For each of these choices, we can append a 4 in $n+1$ ways, so there are $f(n)(n+1)$ ways to construct a positive integer with exactly $n+1$ digits and a sum of 5. However, we have double-counted the positive integers with exactly $n+1$ digits and a sum of 5 that have a units digit of 4. There are $f(n)$ such positive integers, so we need to subtract $f(n)$ from the total count. Therefore, we have $f(n+1)=f(n)(n+1)-f(n)+f(n)=f(n)(n+1)$.\nBy the inductive hypothesis, we have $f(n)=\\binom{n+4}{4}$, so we have $f(n+1)=\\binom{n+4}{4}(n+1)$. We can use Pascal's identity to rewrite this as $f(n+1)=\\binom{n+5}{4}$, which completes the inductive step.\nTherefore, we have shown that $f(n)=\\binom{n+4}{4}$ for all positive integers $n$.\nNow, we need to find the number of positive integers $f(1), f(2), \\ldots, f(2014)$ that have a units digit of 1. We can use the fact that $f(n)$ is the number of ways to arrange $n$ 1's and $4$'s in a row. For a positive integer to have a units digit of 1, it must end in 1, so it must have the form $1\\_\\_\\_\\cdots$. Therefore, we need to find the number of ways to arrange $n-1$ 1's and $4$'s in a row, which is $\\binom{n-1+4}{4}=\\binom{n+3}{4}$.\nTherefore, the number of positive integers $f(1), f(2), \\ldots, f(2014)$ that have a units digit of 1 is $\\binom{2014+3}{4}=\\binom{2017}{4}$.\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{159895194}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve the given problem, we first need to understand the properties of logarithms and how to manipulate them to find the value of $\\frac{x}{y}$.\nStep 2:  The given equation is $\\log _{10} x=3+\\log _{10} y$. We can use the property of logarithms that states $\\log _{a} b^{c}=c \\log _{a} b$ to simplify the equation.\nStep 3:  Using this property, we can rewrite the equation as $\\log _{10} x=\\log _{10} y^{3}+\\log _{10} y$.\nStep 4:  We can then use the property that $\\log _{a} b+\\log _{a} c=\\log _{a} b c$ to combine the terms on the right-hand side of the equation.\nStep 5:  This gives us $\\log _{10} x=\\log _{10} y^{3} \\cdot \\log _{10} y$.\nStep 6:  We can further simplify this to $\\log _{10} x=\\log _{10} y^{4}$.\nStep 7:  Now, we can use the property that if $\\log _{a} b=\\log _{a} c$, then $b=c$ to equate the expressions inside the logarithms.\nStep 8:  This gives us $x=y^{4}$.\nStep 9:  To find the value of $\\frac{x}{y}$, we can divide both sides of the equation by $y$.\nStep 10:  This gives us $\\frac{x}{y}=y^{3}$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the value of $\\frac{x}{y}$ is $y^{3}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{y^3}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve for $x^{2}+\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$, we first need to understand the given equation $x+\\frac{1}{x}=\\frac{13}{6}$ and how it relates to the expression we want to find.\nStep 2:  We can start by squaring the given equation to obtain a new equation that involves $x^{2}+\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$.\nStep 3:  Squaring the equation $x+\\frac{1}{x}=\\frac{13}{6}$ gives us $\\left(x+\\frac{1}{x}\\right)^{2}=\\left(\\frac{13}{6}\\right)^{2}$.\nStep 4:  Expanding the left-hand side of the equation, we get $x^{2}+2\\left(x\\cdot\\frac{1}{x}\\right)+\\frac{1}{x^{2}}=\\frac{169}{36}$.\nStep 5:  Simplifying the middle term, we have $x^{2}+2+\\frac{1}{x^{2}}=\\frac{169}{36}$.\nStep 6:  To isolate $x^{2}+\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation, giving us $x^{2}+\\frac{1}{x^{2}}=\\frac{169}{36}-2$.\nStep 7:  Further simplifying, we get $x^{2}+\\frac{1}{x^{2}}=\\frac{169-72}{36}$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, $x^{2}+\\frac{1}{x^{2}}=\\frac{97}{36}$.\nStep 9:  So, the value of $x^{2}+\\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ is $\\frac{97}{36}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{97}{36}}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to consider the different scenarios that can occur when the die is rolled and the changes that are made to the die based on the outcome of the roll.\nStep 2:  First, let's consider the probability of rolling an odd number on the first roll. The odd numbers on the die are 1, 3, and 4 is not odd, 6 is not odd, and 8 is not odd, so the odd numbers are 1, 3. There are 2 odd numbers out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability of rolling an odd number is $\\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\nStep 3:  If an odd number is rolled, all odd numbers on the die are doubled. This means that the new odd numbers on the die will be 2, 6, and 16. The probability of rolling a 2 on the second roll, given that an odd number was rolled first, is $\\frac{1}{6}$.\nStep 4:  Now, let's consider the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll. The even numbers on the die are 2, 4, and 6, and 8. There are 4 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability of rolling an even number is $\\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}$.\nStep 5:  If an even number is rolled, all even numbers on the die are halved. This means that the new even numbers on the die will be 1, 2, and 3, and 4. The probability of rolling a 2 on the second roll, given that an even number was rolled first, is $\\frac{1}{6}$.\nStep 6:  To find the overall probability of rolling a 2 on the second roll, we need to consider both scenarios and their respective probabilities. The probability of rolling a 2 on the second roll, given that an odd number was rolled first, is $\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{18}$. The probability of rolling a 2 on the second roll, given that an even number was rolled first, is $\\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{9}$.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the overall probability of rolling a 2 on the second roll is the sum of these two probabilities, which is $\\frac{1}{18} + \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{1}{18} + \\frac{2}{18} = \\frac{3}{18} = \\frac{1}{6}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$",

We can use this information to set up a system of linear equations based on the given formula.\nStep 4:  The first step is to substitute the values of $W, D, A, B,$ and Points for each team into the formula to obtain a system of linear equations.\nStep 5:  For example, for Sussex, we have $201 = 6w + 4d + 30a + 63b$.\nStep 6:  Similarly, we can set up equations for the other six teams using their respective values.\nStep 7:  Once we have the system of linear equations, we can solve for the values of $w, d, a,$ and $b$ by using methods such as substitution or elimination.\nStep 8:  After solving the system of equations, we can determine the values of $w, d, a,$ and $b$ that satisfy all the equations simultaneously.\nStep 9:  The solution to the system of equations will give us the values of $w, d, a,$ and $b$ that represent the points for a win, a draw, a bonus bowling point, and a bonus batting point, respectively.\nStep 10:  Therefore, we can use the given information and the system of linear equations to determine the values of $w, d, a,$ and $b$.\n\nNow, let's solve the system of linear equations to find the values of $w, d, a,$ and $b$.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the coefficients matrix A\nA = np.array([[6, 4, 30, 63], [6, 3, 35, 60], [6, 4, 30, 54], [6, 4, 28, 55], [5, 7, 18, 59], [4, 7, 32, 59], [4, 7, 36, 55]])\n\n# Define the constants matrix B\nB = np.array([201, 200, 192, 191, 178, 176, 176])\n\n# Solve the system of linear equations using np.linalg.solve\nsolution = np.linalg.solve(A, B)\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(\"The values of w, d, a, and b are:\", solution)\n```\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{4.0 8.0 24.0 0.0}",

This means that $\\lfloor x\\rfloor$ is the integer part of $x$.\nStep 3:  We can start by considering the possible values of $\\lfloor x\\rfloor$. Since $x$ is positive, $\\lfloor x\\rfloor$ must also be positive.\nStep 4:  We know that $x\\lfloor x\\rfloor=17$, and since $x$ is positive, we can deduce that $\\lfloor x\\rfloor$ must be a factor of $17$.\nStep 5:  The factors of $17$ are $1$ and $17$ itself. However, since $x$ is positive, $\\lfloor x\\rfloor$ cannot be $1$ because then $x$ would be less than $2$, and $x\\lfloor x\\rfloor$ would be less than $2$ as well, which contradicts the given condition.\nStep 6:  Therefore, we can conclude that $\\lfloor x\\rfloor=17$. This means that $x$ lies between $17$ and $18$, i.e., $17 < x < 18$.\nStep 7:  Now, we can use the fact that $x\\lfloor x\\rfloor=17$ to find the value of $x$. Since $\\lfloor x\\rfloor=17$, we have $x\\cdot 17=17$, which implies that $x=1$.\nStep 8:  However, we know that $x$ lies between $17$ and $18$, so $x$ cannot be $1$. This is a contradiction, and we need to re-evaluate our previous conclusion.\nStep 9:  Let's consider the case where $\\lfloor x\\rfloor=4$. This means that $4 \\leq x < 5$. We can use the fact that $x\\lfloor x\\rfloor=17$ to find the value of $x$. Substituting $\\lfloor x\\rfloor=4$, we get $4x=17$, which implies that $x=\\frac{17}{4}$.\nStep 10:  Since $x$ lies between $4$ and $5$, we can check if $x=\\frac{17}{4}$ satisfies the given condition. We have $\\lfloor \\frac{17}{4}\\rfloor=4$, and $\\frac{17}{4}\\cdot 4=17$, which satisfies the condition.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the value of $x$ is $\\frac{17}{4}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{17}{4}}$",

When the cube is cut into $n^{3}$ smaller cubes of unit length, we need to find the value of $n$ such that exactly 125 of these smaller cubes have no faces painted red.\nStep 3:  Let's consider the number of smaller cubes with no painted faces. These cubes are located at the corners of the original cube, and there are $n^3 - (n-2)^3$ such cubes. This is because we subtract the number of cubes that have at least one face painted from the total number of cubes.\nStep 4:  We can simplify the expression $n^3 - (n-2)^3$ to get $3n^2 - 6n + 8$. This represents the number of smaller cubes with no painted faces.\nStep 5:  We are given that this number is equal to 125, so we have the equation $3n^2 - 6n + 8 = 125$.\nStep 6:  We can simplify this equation to get $3n^2 - 6n - 117 = 0$.\nStep 7:  To solve for $n$, we can use the quadratic formula, which states that for an equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the solutions are given by $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.\nStep 8:  Applying the quadratic formula to our equation, we get $n = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{36 + 1404}}{6}$.\nStep 9:  Simplifying further, we have $n = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{1440}}{6}$.\nStep 10:  This gives us $n = \\frac{6 \\pm 12\\sqrt{10}}{6}$.\nStep 11:  Since $n$ is an integer, we take the positive solution, which is $n = 1 + 2\\sqrt{10}$.\nStep 12:  However, we need to find an integer value for $n$, so we need to consider the next integer value after $1 + 2\\sqrt{10}$.\nStep 13:  The next integer value is $n = 6$, which satisfies the condition that exactly 125 of the smaller cubes have no faces painted red.\nStep 14:  Therefore, the value of $n$ is $\\boxed{6}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$",

This implies that both $g$ and $h$ must be integers.\nStep 5:  To find the values of $g$ and $h$, we can use the method of substitution or elimination to solve the system of equations.\nStep 6:  We can start by solving the first equation for $g$, which gives us $g = \\frac{201 -

988 = -787$, which gives us $h = -\\frac{787}{17} = -46\\frac{5}{17}$.\nStep 72:  Since $h$ must be an integer, we need to find the closest integer value to $-46\\frac{5}{17}$.\nStep 73:  The closest integer value to $-46\\frac{5}{17}$ is $-47$.\nStep 74:  Therefore, the number of toy helicopters Thurka bought is $-47$.\nStep 75:  However, since the number of toy helicopters cannot be negative, we need to re-examine our solution.\nStep 76:  Upon re-examining our solution, we realize that we made an error in our previous calculations.\nStep 77:  Let's re-evaluate the system of equations $19g + 17h = 201$ and $g = \\frac{201 - 17h}{19}$.\nStep 78:  We can start by finding the value of $h$ that makes the numerator $201 - 17h$ a multiple of $19$.\nStep 79:  By trying different values of $h$, we find that when $h = 7$, the numerator becomes $201 -

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the properties of a geometric sequence and how to use the given information to find the common ratio and the first term of the sequence.\nStep 2:  Let's denote the first term of the sequence as $a$ and the common ratio as $r$. The sum of the first $n$ terms of a geometric sequence can be calculated using the formula $S_n = a\\left(\\frac{1-r^n}{1-r}\\right)$.\nStep 3:  We are given that the sum of the first two terms is 40, the sum of the first three terms is 76, and the sum of the first four terms is 130. We can use this information to form equations and solve for the common ratio $r$ and the first term $a$.\nStep 4:  The sum of the first two terms is $a + ar = 40$, the sum of the first three terms is $a + ar + ar^2 = 76$, and the sum of the first four terms is $a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3 = 130$.\nStep 5:  Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us $ar + ar^2 = 36$, and subtracting the second equation from the third gives us $ar^2 + ar^3 = 54$.\nStep 6:  Dividing the second equation by the first gives us $r = \\frac{54}{36} = \\frac{3}{2}$.\nStep 7:  Now that we have the common ratio, we can substitute it back into the equation $a + ar = 40$ to solve for the first term $a$. This gives us $a + \\frac{3}{2}a = 40$, which simplifies to $a = \\frac{80}{5} = 16$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the first term of the sequence is $16$ and the common ratio is $\\frac{3}{2}$.\nStep 9:  To find the number of terms that are integers, we need to find the number of terms in the sequence that are integers. We can do this by finding the number of terms that are multiples of the first term $a$.\nStep 10:  The terms of the sequence are $16, 24, 36, 54, 81, 121, 181, 271, 405, 608, 911, 1365, 2044, 3069, 4593, 6882, 10281, 15363, 22944, 34307$.\nStep 11:  We can see that the terms $16, 24, 36, 54, 81, 121, 181, 271, 405, 608, 911, 1365, 2044, 3069, 4593, 6882, 10281, 15363, 22944$ are all integers.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the number of terms in the sequence that are integers is $\\boxed{19}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{19}$",

We can rewrite $\\log _{10}\\left(x^{4}\\right)$ as $4 \\log _{10} x$ using the power rule of logarithms.\nStep 3:  Substituting this into the equation gives us $4 \\log _{10} x=\\left(\\log _{10} x\\right)^{3}$.\nStep 4:  Let's introduce a new variable $a=\\log _{10} x$ to simplify the equation further. This transforms the equation into $4 a=a^{3}$.\nStep 5:  Rearranging the terms, we get $a^{3}-4 a=0$.\nStep 6:  Factoring out $a$, we have $a(a^{2}-4)=0$.\nStep 7:  This gives us two possible solutions: $a=0$ or $a^{2}-4=0$.\nStep 8:  Solving $a^{2}-4=0$ gives us $a^{2}=4$, which leads to $a=\\pm 2$.\nStep 9:  Substituting back $a=\\log _{10} x$, we get $\\log _{10} x=0, 2, \\text { or }-2$.\nStep 10:  From $\\log _{10} x=0$, we find $x=1$.\nStep 11:  From $\\log _{10} x=2$, we find $x=10^{2}=100$.\nStep 12:  From $\\log _{10} x=-2$, we find $x=10^{-2}=\\frac{1}{100}$.\nStep 13:  Therefore, the points of intersection are $(1,0)$, $(100,4)$, and $\\left(\\frac{1}{100},-8\\right)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\left(1,0\\right),\\left(100,4\\right),\\left(\\frac{1}{100},-8\\right)}$",
  "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the process of Oi-Lam and George tossing coins and the conditions for George to toss exactly one head.\n## Step 2:  Oi-Lam tosses three fair coins, and we need to consider the possible outcomes of these tosses. Each coin can land in one of two ways - heads (H) or tails (T).\n## Step 3:  The possible outcomes for the three coins are HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, and TTT. Out of these, only the outcomes HHT, HTH, and THH result in George having two tails and one head to toss.\n## Step 4:  Now, we need to calculate the probability of George getting exactly one head. This can happen in three ways: he gets a head on the first toss and tails on the second and third, a head on the second toss and tails on the first and third, or a head on the third toss and tails on the first and second.\n## Step 5:  The probability of getting a head on a single toss is $\\frac{1}{2}$, and the probability of getting a tail is also $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n## Step 6:  Therefore, the probability of George getting exactly one head is the sum of the probabilities of these three scenarios: $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{8}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{8}}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given expression and how it relates to the angles involved.\nStep 2:  Ross starts with an angle of measure $8^{\\circ}$ and doubles it 10 times until he obtains $8192^{\\circ}$. This means the angles he obtains are $8^{\\circ}, 16^{\\circ}, 32^{\\circ}, \\ldots, 4096^{\\circ}, 8192^{\\circ}$.\nStep 3:  He then adds up the reciprocals of the sines of these 11 angles, which gives us the expression $S=\\frac{1}{\\sin 8^{\\circ}}+\\frac{1}{\\sin 16^{\\circ}}+\\frac{1}{\\sin 32^{\\circ}}+\\cdots+\\frac{1}{\\sin 4096^{\\circ}}+\\frac{1}{\\sin 8192^{\\circ}}$.\nStep 4:  We are asked to determine the measure of the acute angle $\\alpha$ so that $S=\\frac{1}{\\sin \\alpha}$.\nStep 5:  To simplify the given expression, we can use the identity $\\sin 2x = 2 \\sin x \\cos x$. This allows us to express the reciprocals of the sines in terms of the cosines of the angles.\nStep 6:  By using this identity, we can rewrite the expression for $S$ in terms of the cosines of the angles, which will help us simplify the expression further.\nStep 7:  After simplifying the expression, we can use the identity $\\cos \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2} - x \\right) = \\sin x$ to express the sum of the cosines in terms of the sines of the angles.\nStep 8:  This will allow us to relate the sum of the cosines to the sum of the sines, which will help us find the value of $S$.\nStep 9:  Finally, we can use the fact that $S = \\frac{1}{\\sin \\alpha}$ to determine the measure of the acute angle $\\alpha$.\n\nStep 10:  Now, let's proceed with the calculations to simplify the expression for $S$ and find the value of $\\alpha$.\n\nStep 11:  We start by expressing the reciprocals of the sines in terms of the cosines of the angles using the identity $\\sin 2x = 2 \\sin x \\cos x$.\n\nStep 12:  This gives us $\\frac{1}{\\sin 8^{\\circ}} = \\frac{\\cos 4^{\\circ}}{\\sin 8^{\\circ} \\cos 4^{\\circ}} = \\frac{\\cos 4^{\\circ}}{\\sin 4^{\\circ}}$.\n\nStep 13:  Similarly, we can express the other reciprocals of the sines in terms of the cosines of the angles.\n\nStep 14:  After expressing all the reciprocals of the sines in terms of the cosines, we can simplify the expression for $S$.\n\nStep 15:  We find that $S = \\frac{\\cos 4^{\\circ}}{\\sin 4^{\\circ}} + \\frac{\\cos 8^{\\circ}}{\\sin 8^{\\circ}} + \\frac{\\cos 16^{\\circ}}{\\sin 16^{\\circ}} + \\cdots + \\frac{\\cos 4096^{\\circ}}{\\sin 4096^{\\circ}} + \\frac{\\cos 8192^{\\circ}}{\\sin 8192^{\\circ}}$.\n\nStep 16:  Using the identity $\\cos \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2} - x \\right) = \\sin x$, we can express the sum of the cosines in terms of the sines of the angles.\n\nStep 17:  This gives us $S = \\frac{\\sin 4^{\\circ}}{\\sin 4^{\\circ}} + \\frac{\\sin 8^{\\circ}}{\\sin 8^{\\circ}} + \\frac{\\sin 16^{\\circ}}{\\sin 16^{\\circ}} + \\cdots + \\frac{\\sin 4096^{\\circ}}{\\sin 4096^{\\circ}} + \\frac{\\sin 8192^{\\circ}}{\\sin 8192^{\\circ}}$.\n\nStep 18:  Simplifying this expression, we find that $S = 1 + 1 + 1 + \\cdots + 1 + 1$.\n\nStep 19:  There are 11 terms in the sum, so $S = 11$.\n\nStep 20:  Now, we can use the fact that $S = \\frac{1}{\\sin \\alpha}$ to determine the measure of the acute angle $\\alpha$.\n\nStep 21:  We have $S = \\frac{1}{\\sin \\alpha} = 11$.\n\nStep 22:  Therefore, $\\sin \\alpha = \\frac{1}{11}$.\n\nStep 23:  To find the measure of the acute angle $\\alpha$, we can use the inverse sine function.\n\nStep 24:  We have $\\alpha = \\sin^{-1} \\left( \\frac{1}{11} \\right)$.\n\nStep 25:  Using a calculator or trigonometric table, we can find that $\\sin^{-1} \\left( \\frac{1}{11} \\right) \\approx 6.54^{\\circ}$.\n\nStep 26:  However, we are asked to find the measure of the acute angle $\\alpha$ without using a calculator.\n\nStep 27:  Since $\\sin \\alpha = \\frac{1}{11}$, we can use the fact that $\\sin \\alpha = \\sin (180^{\\circ} -

  "Step 1:  To find the 2007th term of the sequence, we need to understand the pattern of how each term is generated from the previous one.\nStep 2:  The first term is given as 2007. To find the second term, we need to calculate the sum of the cubes of the digits of 2007. This means we take each digit of 2007, cube it, and then sum those cubes to get the second term.\nStep 3:  The digits of 2007 are 2, 0, 0, and 7. Cubing each of these gives us $2^3 = 8$, $0^3 = 0$, $0^3 = 0$, and $7^3 = 343$. Summing these gives us $8 + 0 + 0 + 343 = 351$ as the second term.\nStep 4:  Now, we need to find the third term by repeating the process with the second term, 351. The digits of 351 are 3, 5, and 1. Cubing each of these gives us $3^3 = 27$, $5^3 = 125$, and $1^3 = 1$. Summing these gives us $27 + 125 + 1 = 153$ as the third term.\nStep 5:  Continuing this process, we find the fourth term by cubing the digits of 153, which are 1, 5, and 3.

Summing these gives us $1 + 125 + 27 = 153$ as the fourth term.\nStep 6:  We observe that the fourth term is the same as the third term, which means the sequence has entered a loop. This loop will continue indefinitely, and the 2007th term will be the same as the third term, which is 153.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the 2007th term of the sequence is $\\boxed{153}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{153}$",

We can factor out common terms to get $(a+b)(c+d) = 2023$.\n## Step 3:  Next, we can use the second equation $a+b+c+d = 296$ to express $a+b$ as $296-c-d$.\n## Step 4:  Substituting this expression into the factored form of the first equation, we get $(296-c-d)(c+d) = 2023$.\n## Step 5:  Expanding this equation, we obtain $296c + 296d - c^2 - cd - dc - d^2 = 2023$.\n## Step 6:  Rearranging the terms, we have $-c^2 - d^2 - cd + 296c + 296d - 2023 = 0$.\n## Step 7:  This equation can be further simplified to $-(c^2 + d^2 + cd) + 296(c + d) - 2023 = 0$.\n## Step 8:  We can then complete the square by adding and subtracting $(c+d)^2/4$ to the equation, which gives us $-(c+d)^2/4 + 296(c+d) - 2023 = 0$.\n## Step 9:  Multiplying through by $-4$ to eliminate the fraction, we get $(c+d)^2/4 - 4(296)(c+d) + 4(2023) = 0$.\n## Step 10:  This simplifies to $(c+d)^2 - 1184(c+d) + 8092 = 0$.\n## Step 11:  We can then treat $c+d$ as a single variable, say $x$, and rewrite the equation as $x^2 - 1184x + 8092 = 0$.\n## Step 12:  This is a quadratic equation in $x$, and we can solve for $x$ using the quadratic formula.\n## Step 13:  The quadratic formula states that for an equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the solutions are given by $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.\n## Step 14:  Applying this formula to our equation, we get $x = \\frac{1184 \\pm \\sqrt{(-1184)^2 - 4(1)(8092)}}{2(1)}$.\n## Step 15:  Simplifying the expression under the square root, we have $x = \\frac{1184 \\pm \\sqrt{1400064 - 32368}}{2}$.\n## Step 16:  This further simplifies to $x = \\frac{1184 \\pm \\sqrt{1361796}}{2}$.\n## Step 17:  Evaluating the square root, we get $x = \\frac{1184 \\pm 1166}{2}$.\n## Step 18:  Therefore, the solutions for $x$ are $x = \\frac{1184 + 1166}{2} = 1175$ and $x = \\frac{1184 - 1166}{2} = 9$.\n## Step 19:  Since $x = c+d$, we have two possible values for $c+d$: $c+d = 1175$ and $c+d = 9$.\n## Step 20:  We can then use these values to find the corresponding values of $a+b$ by substituting into the equation $a+b = 296-c-d$.\n## Step 21:  For $c+d = 1175$, we have $a+b = 296-1175 = -879$.

However, since the volume is $144 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3}$, the only possible combination is $3 \\times 4 \\times 12$.\nStep 5:  Now, we need to find the surface area of the prism, which is given by the formula $2lw + 2lh + 2wh$.\nStep 6:  Substituting the values of $l$, $w$, and $h$ into the formula, we get $2(3 \\times 4) + 2(3 \\times 12) + 2(4 \\times 12)$.\nStep 7:  Simplifying this expression, we get $24 + 72 + 96$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the surface area of the prism is $192 \\mathrm{~cm}^{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{192}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve for the values of $a, h,$ and $k$, we need to equate the two given equations and compare their coefficients.\nStep 2:  The first equation is $y=a(x-2)(x+4)$, and the second equation is $y=2(x-h)^{2}+k$.\nStep 3:  We can start by expanding the first equation to get $y=a(x^{2}+2x-8)$, which simplifies to $y=ax^{2}+2ax-8a$.\nStep 4:  Now, we can equate the coefficients of the two equations. The coefficient of $x^{2}$ in the first equation is $a$, and in the second equation, it's $2$. So, we have $a=2$.\nStep 5:  Next, we equate the coefficients of $x$ in the two equations. In the first equation, it's $2a$, and in the second equation, it's $-4h$. So, we have $2a=-4h$, which gives us $h=-\\frac{a}{2}=-\\frac{2}{2}=-1$.\nStep 6:  Finally, we equate the constant terms in the two equations. In the first equation, it's $-8a$, and in the second equation, it's $k$. So, we have $-8a=k$, which gives us $k=-8a=-8(2)=-16$.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the values of $a, h,$ and $k$ are $a=2$, $h=-1$, and $k=-16$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2, -1, -16}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the properties of an arithmetic sequence and how to represent it mathematically.\nStep 2:  An arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers in which the difference between any two successive members is a constant. This constant difference is called the common difference.\nStep 3:  Let's denote the first term of the sequence as $a$, the common difference as $d$, and the number of terms as $n$. In this case, we have 5 terms, so $n=5$.\nStep 4:  The general formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is given by $a_n = a + (n-1)d$.\nStep 5:  We are given that the first term $a=5$, and we need to find the possible values of the fifth term, which is $a_5$.\nStep 6:  The sum of the squares of the first 3 terms equals the sum of the squares of the last 2 terms. This gives us the equation $a^2 + (a+d)^2 + (a+2d)^2 = (a+4d)^2 + (a+5d)^2$.\nStep 7:  Substituting $a=5$ into the equation, we get $5^2 + (5+d)^2 + (5+2d)^2 = (5+4d)^2 + (5+5d)^2$.\nStep 8:  Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get $25 + 25 + 2d^2 + 10d + d^2 + 20d + 4d^2 + 40d = 25 + 100d + 16d^2 + 25 + 50d + 25d^2$.\nStep 9:  Simplifying further, we get $50 + 6d^2 + 50d = 50 + 175d + 41d^2$.\nStep 10:  Rearranging the terms, we get $6d^2 + 50d - 41d^2 - 175d = 0$.\nStep 11:  Combining like terms, we get $-35d^2 - 125d = 0$.\nStep 12:  Factoring out $-5d$, we get $-5d(7d + 25) = 0$.\nStep 13:  Setting each factor equal to zero, we get $-5d = 0$ or $7d + 25 = 0$.\nStep 14:  Solving for $d$, we get $d = 0$ or $d = -\\frac{25}{7}$.\nStep 15:  Now, we can find the possible values of the fifth term $a_5$ using the formula $a_n = a + (n-1)d$.\nStep 16:  Substituting $a=5$, $n=5$, and $d=0$, we get $a_5 = 5 + (5-1)(0) = 5$.\nStep 17:  Substituting $a=5$, $n=5$, and $d=-\\frac{25}{7}$, we get $a_5 = 5 + (5-1)(-\\frac{25}{7}) = 5 - \\frac{100}{7} = \\frac{15}{7}$.\nStep 18:  Therefore, the possible values of the fifth term are $5$ and $\\frac{15}{7}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5, \\frac{15}{7}}$",

  "Determine all values of $k$ for which the points $A(1,2), B(11,2)$ and $C(k, 6)$ form a right-angled triangle.\n## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n## Step 2:  First, we need to find the lengths of the sides of the triangle. The distance between points $A(1,2)$ and $B(11,2)$ can be found using the distance formula, which is $\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$. In this case, the distance is $\\sqrt{(11 - 1)^2 + (2 - 2)^2} = \\sqrt{100} = 10$.\n## Step 3:  Next, we need to find the distance between points $A(1,2)$ and $C(k,6)$. Using the distance formula again, we get $\\sqrt{(k - 1)^2 + (6 - 2)^2} = \\sqrt{(k - 1)^2 + 16}$.\n## Step 4:  The distance between points $B(11,2)$ and $C(k,6)$ can be found using the distance formula as well, which gives us $\\sqrt{(k - 11)^2 + (6 - 2)^2} = \\sqrt{(k - 11)^2 + 16}$.\n## Step 5:  Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to set up an equation. We know that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, the length of the hypotenuse is the distance between points $A$ and $B$, which is $10$. The other two sides are the distances between points $A$ and $C$, and points $B$ and $C$.\n## Step 6:  So, we have the equation $10^2 = (\\sqrt{(k - 1)^2 + 16})^2 + (\\sqrt{(k - 11)^2 + 16})^2$.\n## Step 7:  Simplifying the equation, we get $100 = (k - 1)^2 + 16 + (k - 11)^2 + 16$.\n## Step 8:  Combining like terms, we have $100 = (k - 1)^2 + (k - 11)^2 + 32$.\n## Step 9:  Expanding the squares, we get $100 = k^2 - 2k + 1 + k^2 - 22k + 121 + 32$.\n## Step 10:  Simplifying further, we have $100 = 2k^2 - 24k + 154$.\n## Step 11:  Rearranging the equation, we get $2k^2 - 24k - 54 = 0$.\n## Step 12:  Dividing the equation by 2, we have $k^2 - 12k - 27 = 0$.\n## Step 13:  We can solve this quadratic equation by factoring or using the quadratic formula. Factoring, we get $(k - 15)(k + 9/2) = 0$.\n## Step 14:  Setting each factor equal to zero, we get $k - 15 = 0$ or $k + 9/2 = 0$.\n## Step 15:  Solving for $k$, we have $k = 15$ or $k = -9/2$.\n## Step 16:  Therefore, the values of $k$ for which the points $A(1,2), B(11,2)$ and $C(k, 6)$ form a right-angled triangle are $k = 15$ and $k = -9/2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{15}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the speed of the train, the speed of Linh's car, and the time interval between the trains.\nStep 2:  First, let's define the speed of the train as $v$ km/h. We know that Linh is driving at a speed of $60 \\mathrm{~km} / \\mathrm{h}$.\nStep 3:  The problem states that every 10 minutes, Linh is passed by a train traveling in the same direction as she is. This means that the relative speed of the train with respect to Linh is the speed of the train minus the speed of Linh's car.\nStep 4:  Since the trains depart from the station behind her every 3 minutes, we can calculate the distance covered by the train in 10 minutes, which is the distance between two consecutive trains.\nStep 5:  The distance covered by the train in 10 minutes is equal to the speed of the train multiplied by the time interval, which is $10 \\times \\frac{1}{3}$ hours, or $\\frac{10}{3}$ hours.\nStep 6:  We can then use the formula for distance, which is speed multiplied by time, to find the distance between two consecutive trains.\nStep 7:  The distance between two consecutive trains is equal to the speed of the train multiplied by the time interval, which is $v \\times \\frac{10}{3}$.\nStep 8:  Since Linh is passed by a train every 10 minutes, the distance between two consecutive trains is also equal to the speed of Linh's car multiplied by the time interval, which is $60 \\times \\frac{10}{3}$.\nStep 9:  Equating these two expressions for the distance between two consecutive trains, we can solve for the speed of the train, $v$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, we have the equation $v \\times \\frac{10}{3} = 60 \\times \\frac{10}{3}$.\nStep 11:  Solving for $v$, we get $v = 60$ km/h.\nStep 12:  So, the constant speed of the trains is $60 \\mathrm{~km} / \\mathrm{h}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{60}$",

Let's denote the sum as $S$. Then, we can express $S$ as the sum of the individual terms $a_{1}-a_{2}+a_{3}-a_{4}+a_{5}-a_{6}+a_{7}$ over all permutations.\nStep 3:  Now, we need to find the sum of each term $a_{i}$ over all permutations.

After time $t$, the number of atoms of isotope B will be $\\frac{y}{2}$.\nStep 13:  Since the number of atoms of isotope B is halved every 6 minutes, we can write the equation $\\frac{y}{2} = y \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n$, where $n$ is the number of times the number of atoms of isotope B is halved.\nStep 14:  Solving for $n$, we find that $n = \\frac{\\log \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)}{\\log \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)} = 1$.\nStep 15:  Since $n$ is the number of times the number of atoms of isotope B is halved, we can find the time it takes for the number of atoms of isotope B to halve by multiplying $n$ by 6, giving us $t = 6$.\nStep 16:  Therefore, it takes 6 minutes for the number of atoms of isotope B to halve.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand what a prime number is. A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\nStep 2:  We are given two identical dice, each with six faces numbered 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13. We want to find the probability that the sum of the numbers on the top faces of the two dice is a prime number.\nStep 3:  First, let's list all the possible outcomes when rolling the two dice. Since each die has 6 faces, there are a total of $6 \\times 6 = 36$ possible outcomes.\nStep 4:  Next, we need to determine the combinations of dice rolls that result in a prime number sum. The possible sums that are prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.\nStep 5:  We can start by finding the combinations that result in a sum of 2. The only possibility is (2, 0), but since 0 is not a face on the dice, there are no combinations that result in a sum of 2.\nStep 6:  Moving on to a sum of 3, the possible combinations are (3, 0) and (0, 3), but again, 0 is not a face on the dice, so there are no combinations that result in a sum of 3.\nStep 7:  For a sum of 5, the possible combinations are (5, 0), (0, 5), (2, 3), and (3, 2). However, since 0 is not a face on the dice, we can disregard the first two combinations. So, there are 2 combinations that result in a sum of 5.\nStep 8:  For a sum of 7, the possible combinations are (7, 0), (0, 7), (2, 5), (5, 2), (3, 4), and (4, 3). Again, since 0 is not a face on the dice, we can disregard the first two combinations. So, there are 4 combinations that result in a sum of 7.\nStep 9:  For a sum of 11, the possible combinations are (11, 0), (0, 11), (5, 6), and (6, 5). Since 0 is not a face on the dice, we can disregard the first two combinations. So, there are 2 combinations that result in a sum of 11.\nStep 10:  For a sum of 13, the possible combinations are (13, 0), (0, 13), (11, 2), and (2, 11). Since 0 is not a face on the dice, we can disregard the first two combinations. So, there are 2 combinations that result in a sum of 13.\nStep 11:  Now, we can calculate the total number of combinations that result in a prime number sum. This is the sum of the combinations for each prime number sum: $0 + 0 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 10$.\nStep 12:  Finally, we can find the probability by dividing the number of successful outcomes (10) by the total number of possible outcomes (36).\nStep 13:  Therefore, the probability that the sum of the numbers on the top faces is a prime number is $\\frac{10}{36} = \\frac{5}{18}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{18}}",

This confirms that $f(x)-g(x)=44$ for all values of $x$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the linear function $f(x)$ that satisfies the given conditions is $f(x)=x+44$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{44}$",

We have DE^2 + CE^2 = DC^2, where DC is the length of the side of the triangle opposite the right angle.\n## Step 7:  We know that DC = 15, so we can substitute this value into the equation to get DE^2 + 5^2 = 15^2.\n## Step 8:  Solving for DE, we get DE^2 = 225 - 25 = 200, and taking the square root of both sides gives us DE = sqrt(200) = 10*sqrt(2).\n## Step 9:  Now, we need to find the height of the top of the sphere above the plane of the triangle, which is the distance from the center of the sphere to the point of tangency with the side of length 15.\n## Step 10:  This distance is equal to the radius of the sphere, which is 5.\n## Step 11:  Therefore, the height of the top of the sphere above the plane of the triangle is 5 + 10*sqrt(2).\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5 + 10\\sqrt{2}}",
  "Triangle $A B C$ has vertices $A(0,5), B(3,0)$ and $C(8,3)$. Determine the measure of $\\angle A C B$.\nStep 1: To find the measure of $\\angle A C B$, we can use the Law of Cosines, which relates the lengths of the sides of a triangle to the cosine of one of its angles.\nStep 2: First, we need to find the lengths of the sides of the triangle. We can do this by using the distance formula, which is derived from the Pythagorean theorem.\nStep 3: The distance formula is given by $d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$, where $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ are the coordinates of the two points.\nStep 4: Using this formula, we can find the lengths of the sides $AB$, $BC$, and $AC$.\nStep 5: The length of $AB$ is given by $AB = \\sqrt{(3 - 0)^2 + (0 - 5)^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 25} = \\sqrt{34}$.\nStep 6: The length of $BC$ is given by $BC = \\sqrt{(8 - 3)^2 + (3 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{25 + 9} = \\sqrt{34}$.\nStep 7: The length of $AC$ is given by $AC = \\sqrt{(8 - 0)^2 + (3 - 5)^2} = \\sqrt{64 + 4} = \\sqrt{68}$.\nStep 8: Now that we have the lengths of the sides, we can use the Law of Cosines to find the measure of $\\angle A C B$.\nStep 9: The Law of Cosines states that for a triangle with sides of length $a$, $b$, and $c$, and angle $C$ opposite side $c$, we have $c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cos C$.\nStep 10: In this case, we have $a = AB = \\sqrt{34}$, $b = BC = \\sqrt{34}$, and $c = AC = \\sqrt{68}$.\nStep 11: Plugging these values into the Law of Cosines formula, we get $(\\sqrt{68})^2 = (\\sqrt{34})^2 + (\\sqrt{34})^2 - 2(\\sqrt{34})(\\sqrt{34}) \\cos C$.\nStep 12: Simplifying, we get $68 = 34 + 34 - 68 \\cos C$.\nStep 13: Combining like terms, we get $68 = 68 - 68 \\cos C$.\nStep 14: Subtracting 68 from both sides, we get $0 = -68 \\cos C$.\nStep 15: Dividing both sides by -68, we get $\\cos C = 0$.\nStep 16: The cosine of an angle is 0 when the angle is 90 degrees.\nStep 17: Therefore, the measure of $\\angle A C B$ is $\\boxed{90}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{90}$",

We are also given that the probability of each of them winning 3 of the 6 games is $\\frac{5}{16}$.\nStep 2:  The question asks for the probability that Blaise will win more games than Pierre. This means we need to find the probability of Blaise winning 4, 5, or 6 games out of the 6 games played.\nStep 3:  To approach this, we can use the concept of complementary probability. This means we will find the probability of the event we are interested in (Blaise winning more games than Pierre) by subtracting the probability of the event we are not interested in (Blaise winning the same number of games as Pierre) from 1.\nStep 4:  The probability of Blaise and Pierre winning the same number of games is given as $\\frac{5}{16}$, which is the probability of each of them winning 3 games.\nStep 5:  Therefore, the probability of Blaise winning more games than Pierre is $1 - \\frac{5}{16}$.\nStep 6:  We can calculate this as $1 - \\frac{5}{16} = \\frac{11}{16}$.\nStep 7:  Hence, the probability that Blaise will win more games than Pierre is $\\frac{11}{16}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{11}{16}}",

This gives us $\\log_{5x+9}((x+3)^2(5x+9)^2)$.\nStep 5:  Now, we can use the property of logarithms that states $\\log_a(a^n) = n$ to simplify the expression further. This gives us $\\log_{5x+9}((x+3)^2(5x+9)^2) = 2\\log_{5x+9}(x+3)(5x+9)$.\nStep 6:  We then use the property of logarithms that states $\\log_a(a) = 1$ to simplify the expression inside the logarithm. This gives us $2\\log_{5x+9}(x+3)(5x+9) = 2\\log_{5x+9}(5x+9)(x+3)$.\nStep 7:  Now, we can use the property of logarithms that states $\\log_a(a^n) = n$ to simplify the expression further. This gives us $2\\log_{5x+9}(5x+9)(x+3) = 2(1+1) = 4$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the equation simplifies to $2(1+1) = 4$, which is a true statement for all real values of $x$.\nStep 9:  However, we need to consider the restrictions on the domain of the logarithmic functions. The expressions $5x+9$ and $x+3$ must be positive, so we have the inequalities $5x+9 > 0$ and $x+3 > 0$.\nStep 10:  Solving these inequalities, we get $x > -\\frac{9}{5}$ and $x > -3$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the solution to the equation is $x > -\\frac{9}{5}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-\\frac{9}{5}}$",

First, we multiply both sides by $y^{2}$ to get $x=y^{2} x^{2}$.\nStep 7:  Then, we divide both sides by $x$ to get $y^{2} x=x^{2}$.\nStep 8:  Next, we divide both sides by $x^{2}$ to get $y^{2}=\\frac{x^{2}}{x}$.\nStep 9:  Simplifying the right-hand side gives us $y^{2}=\\frac{x}{1}$.\nStep 10:  Taking the square root of both sides gives us $y=\\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{x}{1}}$.\nStep 11:  Since $y$ is a function of $x$, we can express $y$ as $y=\\sqrt{\\frac{x}{1}}$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the function $y$ as a function of $x$ is $y=\\sqrt{x}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\sqrt{x}}$",

We know that $10 = 2 \\cdot 5$, so we need to find the power of $10$ that will give us $2^5$.\nStep 4:  To do this, we can express $10$ as $2 \\cdot 5$ and raise it to the power of $5$.

  "Step 1:  To find the possible values for the area of a right-angled triangle with one side length equal to 60 and with the property that its side lengths form an arithmetic sequence, we need to first understand the properties of an arithmetic sequence and how it applies to the triangle.\nStep 2:  An arithmetic sequence is a sequence in which each term after the first is obtained from the previous term by adding a constant. In the context of the triangle, this means that the side lengths can be represented as $a-d, a, a+d$, where $a$ is the middle side length and $d$ is the common difference between consecutive terms.\nStep 3:  Given that one side length is 60, we can express the other two side lengths as $60-d$ and $60+d$. Since the side lengths form an arithmetic sequence, we have the equation $60-d = a-d$ and $60+d = a+d$.\nStep 4:  Solving these equations, we find that $a = 60$ and $d = 0$. This implies that the side lengths of the triangle are 60, 60, and 60, which is not a valid right-angled triangle as it doesn't satisfy the Pythagorean theorem.\nStep 5:  However, we also have the possibility that the side lengths are $60-d, 60, 60+d$. In this case, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the value of $d$.\nStep 6:  The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, we have $(60-d)^2 + 60^2 = (60+d)^2$.\nStep 7:  Solving this equation, we find that $d = 60\\sqrt{3}$ or $d = -60\\sqrt{3}$. However, since $d$ represents a difference in side lengths, it must be positive, so we discard the negative solution.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the side lengths of the triangle are $60-60\\sqrt{3}, 60, 60+60\\sqrt{3}$.\nStep 9:  The area of a right-angled triangle can be calculated using the formula $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$. In this case, the base and height are the two shorter sides of the triangle.\nStep 10:  Substituting the values of the side lengths into the area formula, we get $\\frac{1}{2} \\times (60-60\\sqrt{3}) \\times 60$.\nStep 11:  Simplifying this expression, we find that the area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times (60-60\\sqrt{3}) \\times 60 = \\boxed{1080(1-\\sqrt{3})}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1080(1-\\sqrt{3})}$",

This equation is equal to zero, so either $\\frac{y}{2}-\\frac{5}{4} = 0$ or $-\\frac{y}{2}+\\frac{5}{2} = 0$. We can solve the first part of the equation for $y$ by rearranging the terms: $y = 5$.

  "Step 1:  To find the probability $P(10)$, we need to consider the different cases in which the product of the numbers on the two balls chosen by Andr\u00e9 is divisible by $10$.\nStep 2:  First, let's consider the case where the number $10$ is chosen from one of the bags. In this case, the other number must be chosen from the remaining $9$ numbers in the other bag. Since $10$ is a factor of $10$, the product of the two numbers will be divisible by $10$.\nStep 3:  Now, let's consider the case where the number $10$ is not chosen from either bag. In this case, we need to find the probability that the product of the two numbers chosen is divisible by $10$.\nStep 4:  To do this, we need to consider the different combinations of numbers that can be chosen from the two bags. We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the probability of the product being divisible by $10$.\nStep 5:  We start by finding the probability that the product is divisible by $2$ and $5$, and then subtract the probability that the product is divisible by $10$.\nStep 6:  The probability that the product is divisible by $2$ is $\\frac{4}{9}$, and the probability that the product is divisible by $5$ is $\\frac{2}{9}$.\nStep 7:  However, we need to subtract the probability that the product is divisible by $10$, which is $\\frac{1}{9}$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the probability that the product is divisible by $10$ is $\\frac{4}{9} + \\frac{2}{9} - \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{5}{9}$.\nStep 9:  Finally, we need to add the probabilities of the two cases to find the overall probability $P(10)$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, $P(10) = \\frac{1}{9} + \\frac{5}{9} = \\frac{6}{9} = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$",
  "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence, which is given by S = n/2 * (a + l), where S is the sum of the sequence, n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and l is the last term.\n## Step 2:  We are given that the first term (a) is 1, the last term (l) is 19, and the sum (S) is 70. We need to find the number of terms (n) in the sequence.\n## Step 3:  Plugging the given values into the formula, we get 70 = n/2 * (1 + 19).\n## Step 4:  Simplifying the equation, we have 70 = n/2 * 20.\n## Step 5:  Multiplying both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction, we get 140 = n * 20.\n## Step 6:  To solve for n, we divide both sides by 20, which gives us n = 140 / 20.\n## Step 7:  Simplifying the division, we find that n = 7.\n## Step 8:  Therefore, the sequence has 7 terms.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first understand what is being asked. We are given a three-digit number $n$ with the digits $a$, $b$, and $c$, and we want to find the probability that the sum of the digits of $n$ is 24.\nStep 2:  We know that the sum of the digits of $n$ is $a+b+c$, and we want this sum to be 24. This means that $a+b+c=24$.\nStep 3:  We also know that $a$, $b$, and $c$ are all positive integers, and $1 \\le a \\le 9$, $0 \\le b \\le 9$, and $0 \\le c \\le 9$.\nStep 4:  To find the number of solutions to the equation $a+b+c=24$, we can use a combinatorial approach. We can think of this as distributing 24 identical items (in this case, the sum of the digits) into 3 distinct boxes (the digits $a$, $b$, and $c$).\nStep 5:  Using the stars and bars method, we can represent this distribution as $\\binom{24-1}{3-1} = \\binom{23}{2}$.\nStep 6:  This represents the number of ways to choose 2 dividers from 23 items, which gives us the number of solutions to the equation $a+b+c=24$.\nStep 7:  Now, we need to find the total number of three-digit numbers with digits $a$, $b$, and $c$. Since $a$ cannot be 0, there are 9 choices for $a$, and 10 choices for both $b$ and $c$. Therefore, the total number of three-digit numbers is $9 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 10 = 900$.\nStep 8:  Finally, we can find the probability by dividing the number of successful outcomes (where the sum of the digits is 24) by the total number of outcomes (all possible three-digit numbers).\nStep 9:  Therefore, the probability is $\\frac{\\binom{23}{2}}{900} = \\frac{253}{900}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{253}{900}}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand how the translation of a parabola affects its equation and its x-intercepts.\nStep 2:  The given parabola is $y=x^{2}-2 x+4$. When it is translated $p$ units to the right and $q$ units down, its equation becomes $y=(x-p)^{2}-2(x-p)+4-q$.\nStep 3:  We are given that the x-intercepts of the resulting parabola are 3 and 5. This means that when $y=0$, the values of $x$ are 3 and 5.\nStep 4:  Substituting $y=0$ into the translated equation, we get $0=(x-p)^{2}-2(x-p)+4-q$.\nStep 5:  We can simplify this equation to $(x-p)^{2}-2(x-p)+4-q=0$.\nStep 6:  Since the x-intercepts are 3 and 5, we can substitute these values into the equation to get two separate equations: $(3-p)^{2}-2(3-p)+4-q=0$ and $(5-p)^{2}-2(5-p)+4-q=0$.\nStep 7:  We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of $p$ and $q$.\nStep 8:  First, let's expand and simplify the two equations: $(3-p)^{2}-2(3-p)+4-q=0$ becomes $9-6p+p^{2}-6+2p+4-q=0$, which simplifies to $p^{2}-4p+7-q=0$.\nStep 9:  Similarly, $(5-p)^{2}-2(5-p)+4-q=0$ becomes $25-10p+p^{2}-10+2p+4-q=0$, which simplifies to $p^{2}-8p+19-q=0$.\nStep 10:  Now, we have a system of two equations: $p^{2}-4p+7-q=0$ and $p^{2}-8p+19-q=0$.\nStep 11:  Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get $-4p+12=0$, which simplifies to $p=3$.\nStep 12:  Substituting $p=3$ into the first equation, we get $9-12+7-q=0$, which simplifies to $q=4$.\nStep 13:  Therefore, the values of $p$ and $q$ are $p=3$ and $q=4$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3,4}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of a geometric sequence and how logarithms work.\nStep 2:  A geometric sequence is a sequence in which each term after the first is obtained from the previous term by multiplying it by a constant. In this case, we're given three consecutive terms of a geometric sequence: $\\log _{2} x$, $\\left(1+\\log _{4} x\\right)$, and $\\log _{8} 4 x$.\nStep 3:  We know that the common ratio between consecutive terms in a geometric sequence is constant. So, we can set up the equation $\\frac{\\log _{4} x}{\\log _{2} x} = \\frac{\\log _{8} 4 x}{\\log _{4} x}$ to find the value of $x$.\nStep 4:  To simplify this equation, we can use the properties of logarithms. We can rewrite $\\log _{4} x$ as $\\frac{\\log _{2} x}{\\log _{2} 4} = \\frac{\\log _{2} x}{2}$ and $\\log _{8} 4 x$ as $\\frac{\\log _{2} 4 x}{\\log _{2} 8} = \\frac{\\log _{2} 4 + \\log _{2} x}{3} = \\frac{2 + \\log _{2} x}{3}$.\nStep 5:  Substituting these values back into the equation, we get $\\frac{\\frac{\\log _{2} x}{2}}{\\log _{2} x} = \\frac{\\frac{2 + \\log _{2} x}{3}}{\\frac{\\log _{2} x}{2}}$.\nStep 6:  Simplifying this equation, we get $\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{2 + \\log _{2} x}{\\frac{3}{2} \\log _{2} x}$.\nStep 7:  Cross-multiplying, we get $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{3}{2} \\log _{2} x = 2 + \\log _{2} x$.\nStep 8:  This simplifies to $\\frac{3}{4} \\log _{2} x = 2 + \\log _{2} x$.\nStep 9:  Subtracting $\\log _{2} x$ from both sides, we get $\\frac{3}{4} \\log _{2} x - \\log _{2} x = 2$.\nStep 10:  Combining the logarithms, we get $-\\frac{1}{4} \\log _{2} x = 2$.\nStep 11:  Multiplying both sides by $-4$, we get $\\log _{2} x = -8$.\nStep 12:  Finally, solving for $x$, we get $x = 2^{-8} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{256}}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{256}}$",

This gives us $a + 2\\sqrt{ab} + b = 50$.\nStep 5:  We can then rearrange the terms to obtain $2\\sqrt{ab} = 50 - a - b$.\nStep 6:  Squaring both sides again, we get $4ab = (50 - a - b)^2 = 2500 - 100(a + b) + a^2 + 2ab + b^2$.\nStep 7:  Simplifying this expression, we have $4ab = 2500 - 100(a + b) + a^2 + 2ab + b^2$.\nStep 8:  Rearranging the terms, we get $0 = a^2 + b^2 - 100(a + b) + 2500 - 2ab$.\nStep 9:  This can be further simplified to $0 = (a - 50)^2 + (b - 50)^2 - 2ab$.\nStep 10:  We can then rewrite this as $0 = (a - 50)^2 + (b - 50)^2 - 2ab = (a - 50)^2 + (b - 50)^2 - 2 \\cdot 50 \\cdot 50$.\nStep 11:  This simplifies to $0 = (a - 50)^2 + (b - 50)^2 - 5000$.\nStep 12:  We can then express this as $(a - 50)^2 + (b - 50)^2 = 5000$.\nStep 13:  Now, we need to find pairs of positive integers $(a, b)$ where $a<b$ that satisfy this equation.\nStep 14:  We can start by considering the possible values of $a$ and $b$ that satisfy the equation $(a - 50)^2 + (b - 50)^2 = 5000$.\nStep 15:  We can then use the fact that $a$ and $b$ are positive integers to narrow down the possible values.\nStep 16:  By considering the possible values of $a$ and $b$, we can find the pairs of positive integers $(a, b)$ that satisfy the equation $\\sqrt{a}+\\sqrt{b}=\\sqrt{50}$.\nStep 17:  After finding the pairs of positive integers $(a, b)$ that satisfy the equation, we can determine the final answer.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\left( 1, \\  49\\right), \\left( 9, \\  16\\right)}$",

  "Step 1:  To find the value of $f(2,5)$, we need to substitute $a=2$ and $b=5$ into the given function $f(a, b)=\\frac{a}{b}+\\frac{b}{a}+\\frac{1}{ab}$.\nStep 2:  Substituting $a=2$ and $b=5$ into the function, we get $f(2,5)=\\frac{2}{5}+\\frac{5}{2}+\\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 5}$.\nStep 3:  Now, we can simplify each fraction individually. The first fraction $\\frac{2}{5}$ remains as it is. The second fraction $\\frac{5}{2}$ also remains as it is. The third fraction $\\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 5}$ can be simplified to $\\frac{1}{10}$.\nStep 4:  So, the expression becomes $f(2,5)=\\frac{2}{5}+\\frac{5}{2}+\\frac{1}{10}$.\nStep 5:  To add these fractions together, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of $5$, $2$, and $10$ is $10$. Therefore, we can rewrite each fraction with a denominator of $10$.\nStep 6:  The first fraction $\\frac{2}{5}$ becomes $\\frac{2 \\cdot 2}{5 \\cdot 2} = \\frac{4}{10}$. The second fraction $\\frac{5}{2}$ becomes $\\frac{5 \\cdot 5}{2 \\cdot 5} = \\frac{25}{10}$. The third fraction $\\frac{1}{10}$ remains the same.\nStep 7:  Now, we can add the fractions together: $f(2,5)=\\frac{4}{10}+\\frac{25}{10}+\\frac{1}{10}$.\nStep 8:  Adding the numerators, we get $4+25+1=30$. Therefore, the sum of the fractions is $\\frac{30}{10}$.\nStep 9:  We can simplify $\\frac{30}{10}$ by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $10$. This gives us $\\frac{30 \\div 10}{10 \\div 10} = \\frac{3}{1}$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the value of $f(2,5)$ is $\\frac{3}{1}$, which simplifies to $3$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first understand the function $f(a, b)$ and then find the values of $a$ for which $f(a, a)$ is an integer.\nStep 2:  The function $f(a, b)$ is defined as $\\frac{a}{b}+\\frac{b}{a}+\\frac{1}{ab}$.\nStep 3:  We are given that $f(a, a)$ is an integer, so we need to find the values of $a$ for which this is true.\nStep 4:  Substituting $a$ for $b$ in the function, we get $f(a, a) = \\frac{a}{a} + \\frac{a}{a} + \\frac{1}{a^2} = 2 + \\frac{1}{a^2}$.\nStep 5:  For $f(a, a)$ to be an integer, the term $\\frac{1}{a^2}$ must be an integer.\nStep 6:  This means that $a^2$ must be a perfect square, and since $a$ is a positive integer, $a^2$ is always a perfect square.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the only possible value of $a$ for which $f(a, a)$ is an integer is when $a$ is a perfect square.\nStep 8:  So, the values of $a$ for which $f(a, a)$ is an integer are the perfect squares.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of Amir winning the game, which occurs when he places two cards of the same color on the table.\nStep 2:  First, let's consider the total number of cards in each player's hand. Amir starts with 6 cards, consisting of 2 red, 2 yellow, and 2 green cards. Brigitte starts with 4 cards, consisting of 2 purple and 2 white cards.\nStep 3:  We need to determine the probability of Amir winning on his first turn, which happens if he draws a card of the same color as one of the cards he already has. This probability is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes (drawing a card of the same color) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (drawing any card).\nStep 4:  For Amir's first turn, the probability of drawing a red card is $\\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}$, the probability of drawing a yellow card is $\\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}$, and the probability of drawing a green card is $\\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\nStep 5:  Now, we need to consider the probability of Amir winning on his second turn. This can happen in two ways: either he draws a card of the same color as one of the cards he already has, or he draws a card of the same color as one of the cards Brigitte has played.\nStep 6:  If Amir draws a card of the same color as one of the cards he already has, the probability is $\\frac{1}{3}$, as calculated earlier. If he draws a card of the same color as one of the cards Brigitte has played, the probability is $\\frac{2}{5}$, since there are 2 cards of each color on the table.\nStep 7:  We need to consider all possible combinations of cards that can be drawn by Amir and Brigitte, and calculate the probability of Amir winning in each case.\nStep 8:  After considering all possible combinations, we can calculate the overall probability of Amir winning the game by summing up the probabilities of winning in each case.\nStep 9:  The probability of Amir winning the game is $\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{5}

  "Step 1: The problem provides the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence, which is given by $t_{n}=555-7 n$. We are also given the formula for the sum of the first n terms of the sequence, denoted as $S_{n}$.\n\nStep 2: To find the smallest value of n for which $S_{n}<0$, we need to first express $S_{n}$ in terms of n. We can do this by summing the terms of the arithmetic sequence.\n\nStep 3: The sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence can be expressed as $S_{n} = \\frac{n}{2} (2a + (n-1)d)$, where a is the first term and d is the common difference. In this case, the first term is $t_{1} = 555 - 7(1) = 548$ and the common difference is -7.\n\nStep 4: Substituting the values of a and d into the formula for $S_{n}$, we get $S_{n} = \\frac{n}{2} (2(548) + (n-1)(-7))$.\n\nStep 5: Simplifying the expression for $S_{n}$, we get $S_{n} = \\frac{n}{2} (1096 - 7n + 7)$.\n\nStep 6: Further simplifying, we get $S_{n} = \\frac{n}{2} (1103 - 7n)$.\n\nStep 7: To find the smallest value of n for which $S_{n}<0$, we need to solve the inequality $\\frac{n}{2} (1103 - 7n) < 0$.\n\nStep 8: We can start by finding the values of n for which the expression $1103 - 7n$ is positive or negative.\n\nStep 9: The expression $1103 - 7n$ is positive when $n < \\frac{1103}{7}$ and negative when $n > \\frac{1103}{7}$.\n\nStep 10: Since we are looking for the smallest value of n for which $S_{n}<0$, we need to find the smallest value of n that satisfies the inequality $n > \\frac{1103}{7}$.\n\nStep 11: The smallest integer value of n that satisfies the inequality $n > \\frac{1103}{7}$ is $n = 157$.\n\nStep 12: Therefore, the smallest value of n for which $S_{n}<0$ is $n = 157$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{157}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve the given system of equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. In this case, we'll use the elimination method to find the values of $x$ and $y$.\nStep 2:  First, we'll subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate the $x^2$ term. This gives us the equation $xy - 8x + 8 = 0$.\nStep 3:  Next, we'll solve for $y$ in terms of $x$ from the equation $xy - 8x + 8 = 0$. We can rearrange the terms to get $y = \\frac{8x - 8}{x} = \\frac{8(x - 1)}{x}$.\nStep 4:  Now, we'll substitute the expression for $y$ into the second equation $x^2 - 8x + y = 0$ to solve for $x$. This gives us the equation $x^2 - 8x + \\frac{8(x - 1)}{x} = 0$.\nStep 5:  Multiplying through by $x$ to clear the fraction, we get $x^3 - 8x^2 + 8x - 8 = 0$.\nStep 6:  We can factor the equation $x^3 - 8x^2 + 8x - 8 = 0$ to find the values of $x$ that satisfy the equation.\nStep 7:  Factoring the equation, we get $(x - 2)(x^2 - 6x + 4) = 0$.\nStep 8:  Setting each factor equal to zero, we get $x - 2 = 0$ and $x^2 - 6x + 4 = 0$.\nStep 9:  Solving for $x$ in the first equation, we get $x = 2$.\nStep 10:  For the second equation, we can use the quadratic formula to find the values of $x$. The quadratic formula is given by $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.\nStep 11:  In this case, $a = 1$, $b = -6$, and $c = 4$. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get $x = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{(-6)^2 - 4(1)(4)}}{2(1)}$.\nStep 12:  Simplifying the expression under the square root, we get $x = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{36 - 16}}{2}$.\nStep 13:  This simplifies to $x = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{20}}{2}$.\nStep 14:  Therefore, the solutions for $x$ are $x = 2$ and $x = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{20}}{2}$.\nStep 15:  Now that we have the values of $x$, we can substitute them back into the expression for $y$ to find the corresponding values of $y$.\nStep 16:  For $x = 2$, we get $y = \\frac{8(2 - 1)}{2} = 4$.\nStep 17:  For $x = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{20}}{2}$, we get $y = \\frac{8\\left(\\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{20}}{2} - 1\\right)}{\\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{20}}{2}}$.\nStep 18:  Simplifying the expression, we get $y = \\frac{8\\left(\\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{20}}{2}\\right)}{\\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{20}}{2}}$.\nStep 19:  This simplifies to $y = \\frac{16(4 \\pm \\sqrt{20})}{6 \\pm \\sqrt{20}}$.\nStep 20:  Therefore, the solutions for the system of equations are $(2, 4)$ and $\\left(\\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{20}}{2}, \\frac{16(4 \\pm \\sqrt{20})}{6 \\pm \\sqrt{20}}\\right)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\left(2, 4\\right)}$",

This means that there are 9 possible balls that Billy can remove, and for each of those, there are 9 possible balls that Crystal can remove. Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes is 9 * 9 = 81.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the possible values of b - c\nSince $b$ and $c$ are sums of integers, $b - c$ must be an integer. We need to find the values of $b - c$ that are multiples of 4.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of possible values of b - c\nThe possible values of $b - c$ are the differences between the sums of the numbers on the balls remaining in Billy's bag and the sums of the numbers on the balls remaining in Crystal's bag. Since the sums can range from 10 to 36, the possible values of $b - c$ are the differences between these values, which are multiples of 4.\n\n## Step 6: Count the number of outcomes where b - c is a multiple of 4\nWe need to count the number of outcomes where $b - c$ is a multiple of 4. This can be done by counting the number of outcomes where $b$ and $c$ have the same remainder when divided by 4, and then subtracting the number of outcomes where $b$ and $c$ have different remainders when divided by 4.\n\n## Step 7: Count the number of outcomes where b and c have the same remainder when divided by 4\nThere are 9 possible values of $b$ and 9 possible values of $c$, and each of these values has a remainder of 0, 1, 2, or 3 when divided by 4. Therefore, there are 9 * 9 = 81 possible outcomes, and 9 * 9 = 81 of these outcomes have the same remainder when divided by 4.\n\n## Step 8: Count the number of outcomes where b and c have different remainders when divided by 4\nThere are 9 possible values of $b$ and 9 possible values of $c$, and each of these values has a remainder of 0, 1, 2, or 3 when divided by 4. Therefore, there are 9 * 9 = 81 possible outcomes, and 9 * 9 = 81 of these outcomes have different remainders when divided by 4.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the number of outcomes where b - c is a multiple of 4\nSince there are 81 possible outcomes where $b$ and $c$ have the same remainder when divided by 4, and 81 possible outcomes where $b$ and $c$ have different remainders when divided by 4, the number of outcomes where $b - c$ is a multiple of 4 is 81 - 81 = 0.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate the probability\nThe probability that $b$ and $c$ differ by a multiple of 4 is the number of outcomes where $b - c$ is a multiple of 4 divided by the total number of possible outcomes. Therefore, the probability is 0 / 81 = 0.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

The common divisors of two numbers are the numbers that divide both of them without leaving a remainder.\nStep 3:  We are given that the positive integers 34 and 80 have exactly two positive common divisors, namely 1 and 2.

Applying this to the given equation, we get $\\frac{\\log (48 \\sqrt[3]{3})}{\\log (2 x)} = \\frac{\\log (162 \\sqrt[3]{2})}{\\log (3 x)}$.\nStep 4:  We can further simplify the expressions inside the logarithms. $48 \\sqrt[3]{3}$ can be expressed as $48 \\cdot 3^{\\frac{1}{3}} = 2^4 \\cdot 3^{\\frac{1}{3}}$, and $162 \\sqrt[3]{2}$ can be expressed as $162 \\cdot 2^{\\frac{1}{3}} = 3^4 \\cdot 2^{\\frac{1}{3}}$.\nStep 5:  Substituting these expressions back into the equation, we get $\\frac{\\log (2^4 \\cdot 3^{\\frac{1}{3}})}{\\log (2 x)} = \\frac{\\log (3^4 \\cdot 2^{\\frac{1}{3}})}{\\log (3 x)}$.\nStep 6:  Using the properties of logarithms, we can simplify the expressions inside the logarithms to get $\\frac{4 \\log 2 + \\frac{1}{3} \\log 3}{\\log (2 x)} = \\frac{4 \\log 3 + \\frac{1}{3} \\log 2}{\\log (3 x)}$.\nStep 7:  We can then cross-multiply to get rid of the fractions and simplify the resulting equation to obtain $3(4 \\log 2 + \\frac{1}{3} \\log 3) \\log (3 x) = 4 \\log 3 + \\frac{1}{3} \\log 2 \\log (2 x)$.\nStep 8:  Further simplifying, we get $12 \\log 2 \\log (3 x) + \\log 3 \\log (3 x) = 4 \\log 3 \\log (2 x) + \\frac{1}{3} \\log 2 \\log (2 x)$.\nStep 9:  We can then factor out the common terms to get $\\log (3 x) (12 \\log 2 + \\log 3) = \\log (2 x) (4 \\log 3 + \\frac{1}{3} \\log 2)$.\nStep 10:  Now, we can use the property of logarithms that states $\\log a - \\log b = \\log \\frac{a}{b}$ to simplify the equation to $\\log \\left( \\frac{(3 x)^{12 \\log 2 + \\log 3}}{(2 x)^{4 \\log 3 + \\frac{1}{3} \\log 2}} \\right) = 0$.\nStep 11:  This implies that $\\frac{(3 x)^{12 \\log 2 + \\log 3}}{(2 x)^{4 \\log 3 + \\frac{1}{3} \\log 2}} = 1$.\nStep 12:  We can then simplify the expression inside the logarithm to get $\\frac{3^{12 \\log 2 + \\log 3} \\cdot x^{12 \\log 2 + \\log 3}}{2^{4 \\log 3 + \\frac{1}{3} \\log 2} \\cdot x^{4 \\log 3 + \\frac{1}{3} \\log 2}} = 1$.\nStep 13:  Simplifying further, we get $\\frac{3^{12 \\log 2 + \\log 3}}{2^{4 \\log 3 + \\frac{1}{3} \\log 2}} = 1$.\nStep 14:  We can then use the property of exponents that states $a^b = c$ implies $b = \\log_a c$ to simplify the expression to $12 \\log 2 + \\log 3 = 4 \\log 3 + \\frac{1}{3} \\log 2$.\nStep 15:  Solving for $x$, we get $x = \\boxed{1}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

We need to use this information to determine the value of $A_{4}$.\nStep 3:  The problem states that for each integer $k$, the entry $A_{k}$ is the average of the entry to its left, the entry to its right, and the entry below it. This means that $A_{k} = \\frac{A_{k-1} + A_{k+1} + B_{k}}{3}$.\nStep 4:  Similarly, each entry $B_{k}$ is the average of the entry to its left, the entry to its right, and the entry above it, so $B_{k} = \\frac{A_{k-1} + A_{k} + B_{k-1}}{3}$.\nStep 5:  We can use these relationships to find the values of $B_{0}$, $B_{1}$, and $B_{2}$, and then use them to calculate $A_{4}$.\nStep 6:  First, we find $B_{0}$ using the given values of $A_{0}$ and $A_{1}$.

Substituting the given values, we get $B_{2} = \\frac{0 + 0 + B_{1}}{3} = \\frac{B_{1}}{3}$.\nStep 9:  Now, we can use the values of $B_{0}$, $B_{1}$, and $B_{2}$ to find $A_{4}$ using the relationship $A_{k} = \\frac{A_{k-1} + A_{k+1} + B_{k}}{3}$.\nStep 10:  We have $A_{4} = \\frac{A_{3} + A_{5} + B_{4}}{3}$. We know that $A_{3}=1$, and we need to find $A_{5}$ and $B_{4}$ to calculate $A_{4}$.\nStep 11:  To find $A_{5}$, we use the relationship $A_{k} = \\frac{A_{k-1} + A_{k+1} + B_{k}}{3}$ with $k=4$. We get $A_{5} = \\frac{A_{4} + A_{6} + B_{5}}{3}$.\nStep 12:  To find $B_{4}$, we use the relationship $B_{k} = \\frac{A_{k-1} + A_{k} + B_{k-1}}{3}$ with $k=3$. We get $B_{4} = \\frac{A_{3} + A_{4} + B_{3}}{3}$.\nStep 13:  We can substitute the known values of $A_{3}$ and $B_{3}$ into the equation for $B_{4}$ to find its value.\nStep 14:  After finding the values of $A_{5}$ and $B_{4}$, we can substitute them into the equation for $A_{4}$ to find its value.\nStep 15:  By following these steps, we can determine the value of $A_{4}$ based on the given information and the relationships between the entries in the array.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{8}{9}}$",

  "Problem: Determine the coordinates of the points of intersection of the graphs of $y=\\log _{10}(x-2)$ and $y=1-\\log _{10}(x+1)$. Step 1: To find the points of intersection, we need to set the two equations equal to each other and solve for x. This is because at the points of intersection, the y-values of the two graphs will be the same. Step 2: Set the two equations equal to each other: $\\log _{10}(x-2)=1-\\log _{10}(x+1)$. Step 3: Use the properties of logarithms to simplify the equation. We can rewrite $1-\\log _{10}(x+1)$ as $\\log _{10}\\left(\\frac{10}{x+1}\\right)$. So the equation becomes $\\log _{10}(x-2)=\\log _{10}\\left(\\frac{10}{x+1}\\right)$. Step 4: Since the bases of the logarithms are the same, we can equate the expressions inside the logarithms: $x-2=\\frac{10}{x+1}$. Step 5: Multiply both sides of the equation by $(x+1)$ to eliminate the fraction: $(x-2)(x+1)=10$. Step 6: Expand the left side of the equation: $x^{2}-x-2=10$. Step 7: Add $x$ and $2$ to both sides of the equation to get $x^{2}=12$. Step 8: Take the square root of both sides of the equation to solve for x: $x=\\pm \\sqrt{12}$. Step 9: Simplify the square root: $x=\\pm 2 \\sqrt{3}$. Step 10: Now that we have the x-coordinates of the points of intersection, we can substitute them into either of the original equations to find the corresponding y-coordinates. Let's use the first equation: $y=\\log _{10}(x-2)$. Step 11: Substitute $x=2 \\sqrt{3}$ into the equation: $y=\\log _{10}\\left(2 \\sqrt{3}-2\\right)$. Step 12: Simplify the expression inside the logarithm: $y=\\log _{10}\\left(2(\\sqrt{3}-1)\\right)$. Step 13: Use the properties of logarithms to simplify the expression: $y=\\log _{10} 2+\\log _{10}\\left(\\sqrt{3}-1\\right)$. Step 14: Use a calculator to find the values of the logarithms: $y \\approx 0.3010+0.1461 \\approx 0.4471$. Step 15: Now that we have the y-coordinate, we can write the coordinates of the point of intersection: $\\left(2 \\sqrt{3}, 0.4471\\right)$.

Step 20: Use a calculator to find the values of the logarithms: $y \\approx-0.3010+0.1461 \\approx-0.1549$. Step 21: Now that we have the y-coordinate, we can write the coordinates of the point of intersection: $\\left(-2 \\sqrt{3},-0.1549\\right)$.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first understand the relationship between Charlie's age and the year in which he was born.\nStep 2:  Let's assume that Charlie was born in the year $x$, where $x$ is a four-digit number. This means that the rightmost two digits of the year in which he was born are $x \\pmod{100}$.\nStep 3:  We are given that Charlie's current age is twice the number formed by the rightmost two digits of the year in which he was born. This can be expressed as $2(x \\pmod{100})$.\nStep 4:  Since Charlie was born in the twentieth century, the year in which he was born is between 1900 and 1999. Therefore, we can express his current age as $2014 - x$.\nStep 5:  Equating the two expressions for Charlie's age, we get the equation $2014 - x = 2(x \\pmod{100})$.\nStep 6:  We can simplify this equation by considering the possible values of $x \\pmod{100}$, which range from 0 to 99.\nStep 7:  By analyzing the equation, we find that the only possible value for $x \\pmod{100}$ is 14, which leads to the solution $x = 1914$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the four-digit year in which Charlie was born is $\\boxed{1914}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1914}$",

This gives us 5 possible positions for Peter (2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, or 6th).\nStep 3:  The second restriction is that Peter must be ahead of Bobby, which means that Bobby cannot be in the first or second position. This gives us 4 possible positions for Bobby (3rd, 4th, 5th, or 6th).\nStep 4:  The third restriction is that Marcia must be ahead of Jan, which means that Jan cannot be in the first, second, or third position.

  "## Step 1: Understand the sequence definition\nThe sequence $\\left\\{a_{n}\\right\\}$ is defined with the first two terms given as $a_{1}=X$ and $a_{2}=O$. For any term $a_{n}$ where $n \\geq 3$, it is defined as $a_{n-1}$ followed by the reverse of $a_{n-2}$. This means that each term after the first two is a combination of the previous term and the reverse of the term before that.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the pattern of palindromes\nA palindrome is a sequence that reads the same backward as forward. Given the definition of the sequence, we need to identify how palindromes are formed within this sequence. Since each term after the first two is a combination of the previous term and the reverse of the term before that, we can observe that any term that is a palindrome will be followed by a term that is also a palindrome, because the reverse of a palindrome is itself.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the frequency of palindromes\nGiven the nature of the sequence, every other term starting from $a_{3}$ will be a palindrome. This is because $a_{3}$ is $a_{2}$ (O) followed by the reverse of $a_{1}$ (X), which is OX. Then, $a_{4}$ is $a_{3}$ (OX) followed by the reverse of $a_{2}$ (O), which is OXO, and so on. This pattern continues, with each palindrome being followed by another palindrome.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of palindromes in the first 1000 terms\nSince every other term starting from $a_{3}$ is a palindrome, we can calculate the number of palindromes in the first 1000 terms. The first palindrome is $a_{3}$, and then every other term is a palindrome. Therefore, the number of palindromes in the first 1000 terms is the number of terms that are multiples of 2 (since every other term is a palindrome), which is 500.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{500}$",

  "Step 1:  To find the area of the pentagon $T N Y W R$, we can break it down into simpler shapes whose areas we can easily calculate.\nStep 2:  The pentagon can be divided into a rectangle and two right-angled triangles. The rectangle has vertices at $T=(0,0)$, $N=(2,0)$, $W=(2,6)$, and $R=(0,2)$. The two triangles are $TNY$ and $WRY$.\nStep 3:  First, let's calculate the area of the rectangle. The length of the rectangle is the difference between the x-coordinates of $N$ and $T$, which is $2-0=2$. The width of the rectangle is the difference between the y-coordinates of $R$ and $T$, which is $2-0=2$. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is $2 \\times 2 = 4$.\nStep 4:  Next, we'll calculate the area of the triangle $TNY$. The base of the triangle is the difference between the x-coordinates of $N$ and $T$, which is $2-0=2$. The height of the triangle is the difference between the y-coordinates of $Y$ and $T$, which is $6-0=6$. Therefore, the area of the triangle $TNY$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\times 6 = 6$.\nStep 5:  Then, we'll calculate the area of the triangle $WRY$. The base of the triangle is the difference between the x-coordinates of $R$ and $W$, which is $0-2=-2$. The height of the triangle is the difference between the y-coordinates of $Y$ and $R$, which is $6-2=4$. Therefore, the area of the triangle $WRY$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\times 4 = 4$.\nStep 6:  Finally, we add the areas of the rectangle and the two triangles to find the total area of the pentagon $T N Y W R$.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the relationship between the polynomial and the sides of the rectangle.\nStep 2:  We are given that the lengths of the sides of the rectangle are the zeroes of the polynomial $x^{2}-3Tx+T^{2}$, where $T=20$.\nStep 3:  The polynomial can be factored as $(x-T)(x-T)$, which simplifies to $x^{2}-2Tx+T^{2}$.\nStep 4:  This means that the sides of the rectangle are $T$ and $T$, as the polynomial has repeated roots.\nStep 5:  Since the sides of the rectangle are equal, it is a square, and the length of the diagonal can be found using the Pythagorean theorem.\nStep 6:  The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\nStep 7:  In this case, the diagonal of the rectangle is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle with sides of length $T$ and $T$.\nStep 8:  Applying the Pythagorean theorem, we get the length of the diagonal as $\\sqrt{T^{2}+T^{2}}$.\nStep 9:  Substituting $T=20$, we find the length of the diagonal to be $\\sqrt{20^{2}+20^{2}}$.\nStep 10:  Simplifying this expression, we get $\\sqrt{400+400} = \\sqrt{800}$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the length of the rectangle's diagonal is $\\sqrt{800}$.\nStep 12:  To simplify $\\sqrt{800}$, we can break it down into $\\sqrt{400 \\cdot 2}$.\nStep 13:  This simplifies to $20\\sqrt{2}$.\nStep 14:  Hence, the length of the rectangle's diagonal is $20\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{20\\sqrt{2}}$",

  "Solve the following math problem with clear step\u2011by\u2011step reasoning.\nThe problem asks us to find the least positive integer $n$ such that $\\operatorname{gcd}\\left(n^{3}, n !\\right) \\geq 100$.\nStep 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of greatest common divisor (gcd) and how it relates to factorials and powers of numbers.\nStep 2:  We are looking for the smallest positive integer $n$ such that the gcd of $n^3$ and $n!$ is greater than or equal to $100$.\nStep 3:  First, let's consider the prime factorization of $100$, which is $2^2 \\cdot 5^2$. This tells us that in order for the gcd of $n^3$ and $n!$ to be at least $100$, $n^3$ must have at least two factors of $2$ and two factors of $5$.\nStep 4:  We know that $n!$ will have all the prime factors of $n$, including $2$ and $5$. Therefore, we need to find the smallest $n$ such that $n^3$ has at least two factors of $2$ and two factors of $5$.\nStep 5:  To ensure that $n^3$ has at least two factors of $2$, we need $n$ to be at least $4$. Similarly, to ensure that $n^3$ has at least two factors of $5$, we need $n$ to be at least $10$.\nStep 6:  Therefore, the smallest $n$ that satisfies both conditions is $10$.\nStep 7:  Now, we need to verify that $n=10$ satisfies the given condition. We can calculate the gcd of $10^3$ and $10!$ to confirm that it is indeed greater than or equal to $100$.\nStep 8:  By calculating the gcd, we find that $\\gcd(10^3, 10!) = \\gcd(1000, 3628800) = 1000$, which is greater than or equal to $100$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the least positive integer $n$ such that $\\operatorname{gcd}\\left(n^{3}, n !\\right) \\geq 100$ is $\\boxed{10}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the total number of handshakes and the number of people at the party.\nStep 2:  Let's denote the number of people at the party as $n$. Since Ed leaves early, there are $n-1$ people left at the party.\nStep 3:  The total number of handshakes that take place is given as $20T$, where $T=8$. So, the total number of handshakes is $20 \\times 8 = 160$.\nStep 4:  We know that the number of handshakes can be calculated using the combination formula, $\\binom{n}{2}$, which represents the number of ways to choose 2 people from a group of $n$ people to form a handshake.\nStep 5:  Therefore, we have the equation $\\binom{n}{2} = 160$.\nStep 6:  Solving for $n$, we get $n(n-1)/2 = 160$, which simplifies to $n^2 - n - 320 = 0$.\nStep 7:  By solving this quadratic equation, we find that $n = 17$ or $n = -19.0588$. Since the number of people cannot be negative, we discard the negative solution and conclude that there are 17 people at the party.\nStep 8:  Now, we need to find the number of people who shook hands with Ed. This can be calculated as the number of handshakes involving Ed, which is $n-1$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the number of people who shook hands with Ed is $17-1 = \\boxed{16}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{16}$",

We are asked to find the population of a full town where the residents collectively know how to make 17 dishes.\n\n## Step 2: Recognize the relationship between the number of dishes and the number of residents\nSince each resident knows how to make exactly two dishes, and no two residents know how to make the same pair of dishes, we can establish a one-to-one correspondence between the residents and the pairs of dishes.\n\n## Step 3: Use the concept of combinations to relate the number of residents to the number of dishes\nThe number of pairs of dishes that a resident can make is given by the number of combinations of 2 dishes from the total number of dishes. This can be represented as $\\binom{d}{2}$, where $d$ is the number of dishes.\n\n## Step 4: Establish the relationship between the number of residents and the number of pairs of dishes\nSince each resident corresponds to a unique pair of dishes, the number of residents is equal to the number of pairs of dishes, which is $\\binom{d}{2}$.\n\n## Step 5: Use the formula for combinations to find the number of residents\nThe formula for combinations is $\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$.

Therefore, the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length 2 is $\\binom{d}{2} - \\binom{d-2}{2} = \\frac{d(d-1)}{2} - \\frac{(d-2)(d-3)}{2} = d-1$.\n\nNext, let's consider the case where $k>2$. In this case, we can construct a resident cycle of length $k$ by choosing a dish $D$ and a resident $r$ who knows how to make $D$. We can then choose $k-1$ other residents who know how to make $D$ and do not know how to make any of the dishes that $r$ knows how to make, except for $D$. This gives us a total of $\\binom{d-1}{k-1}$ possible resident cycles of length $k$ that start with the dish $D$ and the resident $r$. However, not all of these cycles are distinguishable, since two cycles that start with the same dish and the same resident may be indistinguishable if they contain the same residents. Therefore, we need to subtract the number of indistinguishable cycles from the total number of cycles.\n\nTo count the number of indistinguishable cycles, we can use the following argument. Suppose we have a resident cycle of length $k$ that starts with the dish $D$ and the resident $r$. We can then remove the resident $r$ from the cycle and obtain a cycle of length $k-1$ that consists of the remaining residents. This cycle must be a resident cycle of length $k-1$ that starts with the dish $D$. Therefore, the number of indistinguishable cycles is equal to the number of resident cycles of length $k-1$ that start with the dish $D$.\n\nUsing this argument, we can show that the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length $k$ in $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$ is given by the following formula:\n\n$$\\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \\binom{d-1}{i} \\cdot \\binom{d-i-1}{k-1-i}$$\n\nThis formula counts the number of ways to choose a dish $D$ and a resident $r$ who knows how to make $D$, and then choose $k-1$ other residents who know how to make $D$ and do not know how to make any of the dishes that $r$ knows how to make, except for $D$. The sum is taken over all possible values of $i$, where $i$ is the number of residents who know how to make $D$ and are not in the cycle.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n$$\\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \\binom{d-1}{i} \\cdot \\binom{d-i-1}{k-1-i}$$\n\n\\boxed{\\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \\binom{d-1}{i} \\cdot \\binom{d-i-1}{k-1-i}}",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of repeating decimals and how to convert them into fractions.\nStep 2:  The given repeating decimal is $.0 \\overline{0231846597}$, which means that the sequence $0231846597$ repeats indefinitely.\nStep 3:  Let's denote the repeating decimal as $x$ and subtract it from $1000000x$ to eliminate the repeating part.\nStep 4:  The subtraction process can be represented as follows:\nStep 5:  $1000000x - x = 1000000 \\cdot 0.\\overline{0231846597} - 0.\\overline{0231846597}$\nStep 6:  This simplifies to $999999x = 23.1846597 \\overline{0231846597} - 0.\\overline{0231846597}$\nStep 7:  After performing the subtraction, we get $999999x = 23.1846597$.\nStep 8:  Now, we can solve for $x$ by dividing both sides by $999999$, giving us $x = \\frac{23.1846597}{999999}$.\nStep 9:  To find the value of $N$, we need to find the denominator of the fraction $\\frac{23.1846597}{999999}$.\nStep 10:  The denominator of the fraction is $999999$, which is equal to $N$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the value of $N$ is $999999$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{999999}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find a four-digit number $n$ such that its square root is three times the sum of the digits of $n$.\nStep 2:  Let's denote the four-digit number as $abcd$, where $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are the individual digits of the number.\nStep 3:  The sum of the digits of $n$ is $a+b+c+d$, and the square root of $n$ is $\\sqrt{abcd}$.\nStep 4:  According to the given condition, we have the equation $\\sqrt{abcd} = 3(a+b+c+d)$.\nStep 5:  To simplify the equation, we can square both sides to get $abcd = 9(a+b+c+d)^2$.\nStep 6:  We know that $abcd$ is a four-digit number, so it must be greater than or equal to $1000$ and less than $10000$.\nStep 7:  This means that $9(a+b+c+d)^2$ must also be a four-digit number, so we have the inequality $1000 \\le 9(a+b+c+d)^2 < 10000$.\nStep 8:  Dividing the inequality by $9$, we get $111.11 \\le (a+b+c+d)^2 < 1111.11$.\nStep 9:  Taking the square root of all parts of the inequality, we get $10.5 \\le a+b+c+d < 33.33$.\nStep 10:  Since $a+b+c+d$ must be an integer, we can conclude that $a+b+c+d$ must be greater than or equal to $11$ and less than $34$.\nStep 11:  We also know that $a+b+c+d$ must be less than $a+b+c+d+1$, so we can conclude that $a+b+c+d$ must be less than $11$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, we have $11 \\le a+b+c+d < 11$.\nStep 13:  This means that $a+b+c+d$ must be equal to $11$.\nStep 14:  Now, we need to find a four-digit number $abcd$ such that $a+b+c+d=11$ and $abcd=9(a+b+c+d)^2$.\nStep 15:  We can start by trying different combinations of digits that add up to $11$.\nStep 16:  One

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find a digit $Y$ such that, for any digit $X$, the seven-digit number $\\underline{1} \\underline{2} \\underline{3} \\underline{X} \\underline{5} \\underline{Y} \\underline{7}$ is not a multiple of 11.\nStep 2:  We know that a number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of its digits in the odd positions and the sum of its digits in the even positions is a multiple of 11.\nStep 3:  In this case, the sum of the digits in the odd positions is $1 + 3 + X + 5 + 7 = 16 + X$, and the sum of the digits in the even positions is $2 + Y$.\nStep 4:  Therefore, the difference between these sums is $(16 + X) - (2 + Y) = 14 + X - Y$.\nStep 5:  For the number to not be a multiple of 11, this difference must not be a multiple of 11.\nStep 6:  We need to find a value of $Y$ such that $14 + X - Y$ is not a multiple of 11 for any value of $X$.\nStep 7:  We can start by trying different values of $Y$ and checking if there exists a value of $X$ such that $14 + X - Y$ is a multiple of 11.\nStep 8:  If we find a value of $Y$ that satisfies this condition, then we have found the correct value of $Y$.\nStep 9:  We can start by trying $Y = 0$ and checking if there exists a value of $X$ such that $14 + X - 0$ is a multiple of 11.\nStep 10:  If $Y = 0$, then $14 + X - 0 = 14 + X$, which is not a multiple of 11 for any value of $X$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, $Y = 0$ is a possible value of $Y$.\nStep 12:  However, we need to check if there are any other values of $Y$ that also satisfy the condition.\nStep 13:  We can try $Y = 1$ and check if there exists a value of $X$ such that $14 + X - 1$ is a multiple of 11.\nStep 14:  If $Y = 1$, then $14 + X - 1 = 13 + X$, which is not a multiple of 11 for any value of $X$.\nStep 15:  Therefore, $Y = 1$ is also a possible value of $Y$.\nStep 16:  We can continue this process and try different values of $Y$ until we find the correct value of $Y$.\nStep 17:  After trying different values of $Y$, we find that $Y = 5$ is the only value that satisfies the condition.\nStep 18:  Therefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{5}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first understand the geometric setup and the conditions given.\nStep 2:  We have a right triangle with legs of length $2 \\sqrt{3}$ and 4. The problem asks us to find the probability that a randomly selected point from the interior of this triangle has a distance of less than 2 from the nearest vertex.\nStep 3:  To approach this, we can divide the problem into two cases: one where the point is closer to the vertex at $(0,0)$ and the other where it is closer to the vertex at $(4,0)$.\nStep 4:  For the first case, we need to find the area of the region that satisfies the given condition. This region is formed by the points that are less than 2 units away from the origin. We can calculate this area by finding the area of the triangle formed by the points $(0,0)$, $(2 \\sqrt{3},0)$, and $(2 \\sqrt{3},2)$, and then subtracting the area of the isosceles right triangle formed by the points $(0,0)$, $(2 \\sqrt{3},0)$, and $(2 \\sqrt{3},2)$.\nStep 5:  Similarly, for the second case, we need to find the area of the region that satisfies the given condition. This region is formed by the points that are less than 2 units away from the point $(4,0)$. We can calculate this area by finding the area of the triangle formed by the points $(4,0)$, $(4,2)$, and $(2 \\sqrt{3},2)$, and then subtracting the area of the isosceles right triangle formed by the points $(4,0)$, $(4,2)$, and $(2 \\sqrt{3},2)$.\nStep 6:  After finding the areas for both cases, we can add them together to get the total area of the region that satisfies the given condition.\nStep 7:  Finally, we can calculate the probability by dividing the total area by the area of the entire triangle.\nStep 8:  By following these steps, we can find the probability $p$ in the form $a+\\sqrt{b} \\pi$, where $a$ and $b$ are rational numbers.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(\\frac{7}{12},3)}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from the point $(2/7, 3/7)$ to itself that touches three of the four sides of square $A R M L$.\nStep 2:  First, we note that the square $A R M L$ is contained in the $x y$-plane with $A=(0,0)$ and $M=(1,1)$. This means that the square has a side length of $1$ unit.\nStep 3:  We are given the point $(2/7, 3/7)$, and we want to find the shortest path from this point to itself that touches three of the four sides of the square.\nStep 4:  To approach this problem, we can consider the three sides of the square that the path can touch. Let's denote the sides as $AB$, $BC$, and $CD$, where $A=(0,0)$, $B=(1,0)$, $C=(1,1)$, and $D=(0,1)$.\nStep 5:  We can then consider the path that touches the sides $AB$, $BC$, and $CD$. This path will be a straight line from the point $(2/7, 3/7)$ to the point $(1,1)$, and then from $(1,1)$ to the point $(0,0)$.\nStep 6:  The length of this path can be calculated using the distance formula, which is the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences in the $x$ and $y$ coordinates.\nStep 7:  The distance from $(2/7, 3/7)$ to $(1,1)$ is $\\sqrt{(1-2/7)^2+(1-3/7)^2} = \\sqrt{(5/7)^2+(4/7)^2} = \\sqrt{41/49}$.\nStep 8:  The distance from $(1,1)$ to $(0,0)$ is $\\sqrt{(0-1)^2+(0-1)^2} = \\sqrt{2}$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the total length of the path is $\\sqrt{41/49} + \\sqrt{2}$.\nStep 10:  However, we need to consider the path that touches the sides $AD$, $BC$, and $CD$.

  "Problem: Compute the ordered triple $(x, y, z)$ representing the farthest lattice point from the origin that satisfies $x y-z^{2}=y^{2} z-x=14$. Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the farthest lattice point from the origin that satisfies the given equations $x y-z^{2}=y^{2} z-x=14$.\nStep 2:  We start by considering the equation $x y-z^{2}=14$. This equation can be rearranged to $x y-z^{2}-14=0$. We can then apply Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick to factorize this equation.\nStep 3:  By adding $14$ to both sides of the equation, we get $x y-z^{2}=14$. Then, we can factorize this equation as $(x-14)(y-14)=z^{2}$.\nStep 4:  Similarly, we can consider the equation $y^{2} z-x=14$. Rearranging this equation gives us $y^{2} z-x-14=0$. Again, applying Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick, we can factorize this equation as $(y-14)(z-14)=x$.\nStep 5:  Now, we have the system of equations $(x-14)(y-14)=z^{2}$ and $(y-14)(z-14)=x$. We can use these equations to find the values of $x$, $y$, and $z$.\nStep 6:  By substituting the value of $x$ from the second equation into the first equation, we get $(y-14)(z-14)(y-14)=z^{2}$. Simplifying this equation gives us $(y-14)^{2}(z-14)=z^{2}$.\nStep 7:  We can then divide both sides of the equation by $z^{2}$ to obtain $\\left(\\frac{y-14}{z}\\right)^{2}\\left(\\frac{z-14}{z}\\right)=1$.\nStep 8:  This equation can be further simplified to $\\left(\\frac{y-14}{z}\\right)^{2}=\\frac{z-14}{z}$.\nStep 9:  Let's denote $\\frac{y-14}{z}$ as $a$. Then, we have $a^{2}=\\frac{z-14}{z}$.\nStep 10:  Rearranging this equation gives us $a^{2}z=z-14$. We can then solve for $z$ to obtain $z(a^{2}-1)=14$.\nStep 11:  Since $z$ is a positive integer, we can conclude that $a^{2}-1$ must be a factor of $14$. The possible values for $a^{2}-1$ are $1$, $2$, $7$, and $14$.\nStep 12:  We can then solve for $a$ in each of these cases to find the corresponding values of $z$.\nStep 13:  For $a^{2}-1=1$, we have $a=1$, which gives us $z=14$. Substituting this value of $z$ back into the equation $a^{2}z=z-14$, we get $1\\cdot 14=14-14$, which is true.\nStep 14:  For $a^{2}-1=2$, we have $a=\\pm\\sqrt{3}$, which is not an integer. Therefore, this case does not yield a valid solution.\nStep 15:  For $a^{2}-1=7$, we have $a=\\pm\\sqrt{8}$, which is not an integer. Therefore, this case does not yield a valid solution.\nStep 16:  For $a^{2}-1=14$, we have $a=\\pm\\sqrt{15}$, which is not an integer. Therefore, this case does not yield a valid solution.\nStep 17:  We have found that the only valid solution is $z=14$.\nStep 18:  Substituting this value of $z$ back into the equation $a^{2}z=z-14$, we get $1\\cdot 14=14-14$, which is true.\nStep 19:  Now, we can use the value of $z$ to find the values of $x$ and $y$.\nStep 20:  From the equation $(y-14)(z-14)=x$, we can substitute $z=14$ to obtain $(y-14)(14-14)=x$, which simplifies to $x=0$.\nStep 21:  Similarly, from the equation $(x-14)(y-14)=z^{2}$, we can substitute $z=14$ to obtain $(x-14)(y-14)=14^{2}$, which simplifies to $(x-14)(y-14)=196$.\nStep 22:  Since $x=0$, we have $(0-14)(y-14)=196$, which simplifies to $-14(y-14)=196$.\nStep 23:  Solving for $y$, we get $y-14=-14$, which gives us $y=0$.\nStep 24:  Therefore, the ordered triple $(x, y, z)$ representing the farthest lattice point from the origin that satisfies the given equations is $(0, 0, 14)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(0, 0, 14)}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of a geometric sequence. A geometric sequence is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio.\nStep 2:  We are given that the sequence $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, \\ldots$ is a geometric sequence with $a_{20}=8$ and $a_{14}=2^{21}$. We are asked to find the value of $a_{21}$.\nStep 3:  The formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence is given by $a_n = a_1 \\cdot r^{(n-1)}$, where $a_n$ is the nth term, $a_1$ is the first term, $r$ is the common ratio, and $n$ is the term number.\nStep 4:  We can use the given information to find the common ratio $r$. We know that $a_{20} = 8$ and $a_{14} = 2^{21}$. Using the formula for the nth term, we can write the equation $\\frac{a_{20}}{a_{14}} = \\frac{8}{2^{21}} = r^{6}$.\nStep 5:  Solving for $r$, we get $r = \\sqrt[6]{\\frac{8}{2^{21}}} = \\sqrt[6]{\\frac{1}{2^{13}}} = \\frac{1}{2^{13/6}}$.\nStep 6:  Now that we have the common ratio $r$, we can find the value of $a_{21}$ using the formula for the nth term. We have $a_{21} = a_{20} \\cdot r = 8 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2^{13/6}}$.\nStep 7:  Simplifying this expression, we get $a_{21} = 8 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2^{13/6}} = 8 \\cdot 2^{-13/6} = 2^{3-13/6} = 2^{(18-13)/6} = 2^{5/6}$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the value of $a_{21}$ is $2^{5/6}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2^{5/6}}$",

Since $\\overline{OE}$ is tangent to circle $L$, we know that $\\overline{OF}$ is perpendicular to $\\overline{EF}$.\nStep 4:  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of $OE$. The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\nStep 5:  In this case, we have a right-angled triangle $\\triangle OEF$ where $OE$ is the hypotenuse, and $OF$ and $EF$ are the other two sides.\nStep 6:  We know that $OF = 4T$ and $EF = T$.

Then, according to the given information, the other leg has a length of $x-2$.\nStep 4:  Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we can relate the lengths of the legs and the hypotenuse. The theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\nStep 5:  Therefore, we have the equation $(x-2)^2 + (2\\sqrt{2})^4 = x^2$, which simplifies to $x^2 - 4x + 4 + 32 = x^2$.\nStep 6:  By further simplifying, we get $-4x + 36 = 0$, and solving for $x$ gives us $x = 9$.\nStep 7:  Now that we have the length of the hypotenuse, we can find the lengths of the other two sides. The first leg has a length of $T^2 = (2\\sqrt{2})^2 = 8$, and the second leg has a length of $x-2 = 9-2 = 7$.\nStep 8:  Finally, we can calculate the perimeter of the triangle by adding the lengths of all three sides: $8 + 7 + 9 = 24$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle is $\\boxed{24}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{24}$",

We can then subtract the second equation from this to eliminate $x$ and solve for $y$.\nStep 6:  Subtracting the second equation from the modified first equation gives us $41x+369y-(40x+41y)=697-42$, which simplifies to $x+328y=655$.\nStep 7:  We can then solve for $x$ by isolating it in the equation. Subtracting $328y$ from both sides gives us $x=655-328y$.\nStep 8:  Now that we have the value of $x$ in terms of $y$, we can substitute this expression into the first equation to solve for $y$.\nStep 9:  Substituting $x=655-328y$ into the first equation gives us $(655-328y)+9y=17$, which simplifies to $655-319y=17$.\nStep 10:  Solving for $y$ gives us $-319y=-638$, and dividing by $-319$ gives us $y=2$.\nStep 11:  Now that we have the value of $y$, we can substitute it back into the expression for $x$ to find its value.\nStep 12:  Substituting $y=2$ into the expression $x=655-328y$ gives us $x=655-328(2)$, which simplifies to $x=655-656=-1$.\nStep 13:  Now that we have the values of $x$ and $y$, we can substitute them into the expression $20x+14y$ to find the final answer.\nStep 14:  Substituting $x=-1$ and $y=2$ into the expression $20x+14y$ gives us $20(-1)+14(2)$, which simplifies to $-20+28=8$.\nStep 15:  Therefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{8}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$",

We can break this down into two cases: Charlie is standing next to Chris, and Charlie is standing next to Abby.\n## Step 4:  If Charlie is standing next to Chris, then Chris and Charlie can be in either order, so there are $2$ possibilities for their positions.

This implies that the constant term $c$ in the quadratic function is $0$.\nStep 3:  Therefore, the quadratic function can be expressed as $f(x) = ax^2 + bx$.\nStep 4:  We also know that the graph of the function passes through the point $(15,225)$. Substituting these values into the function, we get $f(15) = 225$.\nStep 5:  Substituting $x=15$ and $f(15)=225$ into the function $f(x) = ax^2 + bx$, we get $225 = 225a + 15b$.\nStep 6:  This equation can be simplified to $15b = -15a$, which further simplifies to $b = -a$.\nStep 7:  Now, we need to find the integer roots of the quadratic function.

  "Solve the following math problem with clear step\u2011by\u2011step reasoning.\nWe are given that $16_b$ is prime and $97_b$ is a perfect square. We need to find the smallest positive integer base $b$ that satisfies these conditions.\nFirst, let's analyze the condition that $16_b$ is prime. In base $b$, the number $16_b$ can be written as $1\\cdot b^1 + 6\\cdot b^0 = b + 6$. For $16_b$ to be prime, it must not be divisible by any integer other than $1$ and itself. Since $b+6$ is an even number, it is divisible by $2$, which means that $16_b$ is not prime for any even value of $b$. Therefore, $b$ must be an odd number.\nNext, let's analyze the condition that $97_b$ is a perfect square. In base $b$, the number $97_b$ can be written as $9\\cdot b^1 + 7\\cdot b^0 = 9b + 7$. For $97_b$ to be a perfect square, there must exist an integer $x$ such that $9b + 7 = x^2$. We can rewrite this equation as $9b = x^2 - 7$.\nSince $b$ is an odd number, we can write $b = 2k + 1$ for some integer $k$. Substituting this into the equation $9b = x^2 - 7$, we get $9(2k + 1) = x^2 - 7$, which simplifies to $18k + 9 = x^2 - 7$. Rearranging this equation, we get $x^2 - 18k - 16 = 0$.\nThis is a quadratic equation in $x$, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula: $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. In this case, $a = 1$, $b = -18k$, and $c = -16$. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get $x = \\frac{18k \\pm \\sqrt{(-18k)^2 - 4(1)(-16)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{18k \\pm \\sqrt{324k^2 + 64}}{2}$.\nSince $x$ must be an integer, the expression under the square root must be a perfect square. Let's call this perfect square $m^2$. Then, we have $324k^2 + 64 = m^2$. Rearranging this equation, we get $m^2 - 324k^2 = 64$.\nThis is a Diophantine equation, and we can solve it using the method of difference of squares. We can write $m^2 - 324k^2 = (m + 18k)(m - 18k) = 64$. Since $64 = 2^6$, we can write $m + 18k = 2^a$ and $m - 18k = 2^b$ for some integers $a$ and $b$.\nSince $m + 18k$ and $m - 18k$ are both even numbers, we can write $a \\ge 1$ and $b \\ge 1$. Also, since $m + 18k$ and $m - 18k$ are both positive numbers, we can write $a \\le 6$ and $b \\le 6$.\nWe can now try different values of $a$ and $b$ to find a solution to the equation $m + 18k = 2^a$ and $m - 18k = 2^b$. We can start with the smallest possible values of $a$ and $b$, which are $a = 1$ and $b = 1$.\nSubstituting $a = 1$ and $b = 1$ into the equations, we get $m + 18k = 2$ and $m - 18k = 2$. Adding these two equations, we get $2m = 4$, which implies $m = 2$. Substituting $m = 2$ into one of the equations, we get $2 + 18k = 2$, which implies $k = 0$. However, this is not a valid solution since $b = 2k + 1 = 1$ is not an odd number.\nNext, we can try $a = 2$ and $b = 1$. Substituting these values into the equations, we get $m + 18k = 4$ and $m - 18k = 2$. Adding these two equations, we get $2m = 6$, which implies $m = 3$.

It is the number of pairs of consecutive 1's in the binary representation of a positive integer $n$.\nStep 2:  We are asked to compute the sum of $C(n)$ for $n$ ranging from 1 to 256.\nStep 3:  To approach this, we can start by considering the binary representation of the numbers from 1 to 256.\nStep 4:  We know that the binary representation of a number consists of 1's and 0's, and we're interested in counting the number of pairs of consecutive 1's in this representation.\nStep 5:  We can start by examining the binary representation of the numbers from 1 to 256 and counting the number of pairs of consecutive 1's in each representation.\nStep 6:  However, we can also observe a pattern in the binary representation of the numbers from 1 to 256. We can see that the numbers from 1 to 256 can be represented as $2^0, 2^1, 2^2, \\ldots, 2^8$.\nStep 7:  This means that the binary representation of these numbers will have a specific pattern, with each number having a certain number of 1's in its binary representation.\nStep 8:  We can use this pattern to simplify the calculation of $C(n)$ for each number from 1 to 256.\nStep 9:  By analyzing the binary representation of the numbers from 1 to 256, we can find a relationship between the number of pairs of consecutive 1's and the position of the number in the sequence.\nStep 10:  This relationship will allow us to calculate the sum of $C(n)$ for $n$ ranging from 1 to 256 more efficiently.\nStep 11:  We can then use this relationship to compute the sum of $C(n)$ for $n$ ranging from 1 to 256.\nStep 12:  By following this approach, we can find the final answer to the problem.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1024}$",

If there is an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.\nStep 3:  We are given that the set $S$ contains thirteen distinct positive integers whose sum is 120. We want to maximize the median of this set.\nStep 4:  To maximize the median, we need to maximize the middle value of the set. Since the set contains 13 distinct positive integers, the median will be the 7th number when the numbers are arranged in ascending order.\nStep 5:  To maximize the 7th number, we need to minimize the first 6 numbers. The smallest possible values for the first 6 numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, which sum to 21.\nStep 6:  This leaves us with 120 - 21 = 99 for the remaining 7 numbers.

The smallest possible values for these numbers are 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12, which sum to 57.\nStep 7:  This leaves us with 99 - 57 = 42 for the 7th number.

This is because a trailing zero is created by a factor of $2$ multiplied by a factor of $5$.\n\n## Step 3: Count the number of factors of 5 in 11!\nWe can count the number of factors of $5$ in $11!$ by dividing $11$ by increasing powers of $5$ and summing up the results. This gives us: $11/5 + 11/25 = 2 + 0 = 2$.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the base b\nSince $11!$ has exactly two factors of $5$, we need to find the smallest base $b$ such that $11!$ ends in exactly two zeroes when expressed in base $b$. This means that $b$ must be greater than or equal to $10$, because in base $10$, $11!$ ends in two zeroes.\n\n## Step 5: Find the smallest base b\nThe smallest base $b$ that satisfies the condition is $b=10$, because in base $10$, $11!$ ends in exactly two zeroes.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$",

Therefore, each interior angle measures $\\frac{180(n-2)}{n}$ degrees.\nStep 5:  The problem specifically asks for the measure of $\\angle A_{1} A_{20} A_{13}$, which is the angle formed by vertices $A_{1}$, $A_{20}$, and $A_{13}$.\nStep 6:  We can use the fact that the sum of the measures of the interior angles of a polygon is $180(n-2)$ to find the measure of $\\angle A_{1} A_{20} A_{13}$.\nStep 7:  The measure of $\\angle A_{1} A_{20} A_{13}$ is equal to $\\frac{180(n-2)}{n}$, and we are given that this measure is less than $60^{\\circ}$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, we need to find the smallest value of $n$ such that $\\frac{180(n-2)}{n}<60$.\nStep 9:  To solve this inequality, we can start by multiplying both sides by $n$ to get rid of the fraction, which gives us $180(n-2)<60n$.\nStep 10:  Expanding the left-hand side of the inequality, we get $180n-360<60n$.\nStep 11:  Subtracting $60n$ from both sides, we obtain $120n-360<0$.\nStep 12:  Adding $360$ to both sides, we get $120n<360$.\nStep 13:  Dividing both sides by $120$, we find that $n<3$.\nStep 14:  However, since $n$ must be a positive integer, the smallest possible value of $n$ is $3$.\nStep 15:  Therefore, the smallest $n$ such that in the regular $n$-gon $A_{1} A_{2} A_{3} \\cdots A_{n}, \\mathrm{~m} \\angle A_{1} A_{20} A_{13}<60^{\\circ}$ is $\\boxed{3}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$",

This is a well-known series with a formula for the sum: $2^{T+1}-1$.\nStep 3:  Substituting the value of $T$ into the formula, we get $2^{8641}-1$.\nStep 4:  Now, we need to find the logarithm base $4$ of this value. We can use the property of logarithms that states $\\log_{a}b^c=c\\log_{a}b$.\nStep 5:  Applying this property, we get $\\log_{4}(2^{8641}-1)=\\log_{4}(2^{8641})-\\log_{4}(1)$.\nStep 6:  Since $\\log_{a}1=0$, the expression simplifies to $\\log_{4}(2^{8641})$.\nStep 7:  Using the property $\\log_{a}b^c=c\\log_{a}b$, we can rewrite this as $8641\\log_{4}2$.\nStep 8:  We know that $\\log_{4}2=\\frac{1}{2}$, so substituting this value, we get $8641\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}=4320.5$.\nStep 9:  Finally, we need to find the floor of this value, which is the greatest integer less than or equal to $4320.5$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the floor of $\\log_{4}\\left(1+2+4+\\cdots+2^{T}\\right)$ is $\\boxed{4320}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4320}$",

We can express 6 as $3^{1} \\cdot 2$, where $k=1$ and $n^{\\prime}=2$. According to the formula, $d(6)=3^{-1}=\\frac{1}{3}$.\nStep 5:  Next, we need to find $d(16)$.

We can express 72 as $3^{3} \\cdot 1$, where $k=3$ and $n^{\\prime}=1$. Applying the formula, $d(72)=3^{-3}=\\frac{1}{27}$.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the values of $d(6)$, $d(16)$, and $d(72)$ are $\\frac{1}{3}$, $\\frac{1}{9}$, and $\\frac{1}{27}$, respectively.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{9}, \\frac{1}{27}}$",

It is the set of all houses that are the same distance from City Hall as house $n$.\nStep 2:  Given that $d(n) = 1/27$, we know that the radius of the circle centered at City Hall with $n$ on its circumference is $1/27$.\nStep 3:  The set $\\mathcal{N}(n)$ can be thought of as a circle with radius $1/27$ centered at City Hall. This means that any house $m$ that is the same distance from City Hall as $n$ will lie on this circle.\nStep 4:  We are asked to find the ten smallest positive integers $m$ that satisfy $m \\in \\mathcal{N}(n)$. This translates to finding the ten smallest positive integers $m$ such that $d(m) = 1/27$.\nStep 5:  To find these values, we need to consider the equation $d(m) = 1/27$.

Then, $d(m) = 3^{-k}$.\nStep 7:  We want to find the values of $m$ such that $d(m) = 1/27$. This means that $3^{-k} = 1/27$, which implies $k = 3$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, we need to find the values of $m$ such that $m = 3^3 m'$, where $m'$ is an integer not divisible by 3.\nStep 9:  The ten smallest positive integers $m$ that satisfy this condition are $m = 3^3 \\cdot 1, 3^3 \\cdot 2, 3^3 \\cdot 4, 3^3 \\cdot 5, 3^3 \\cdot 7, 3^3 \\cdot 8, 3^3 \\cdot 10, 3^3 \\cdot 11, 3^3 \\cdot 13, 3^3 \\cdot 14$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the ten smallest positive integers $m$ such that $m \\in \\mathcal{N}(n)$ are $\\boxed{27, 54, 108, 135, 189, 216, 270, 297, 351, 378}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{27, 54, 108, 135, 189, 216, 270, 297, 351, 378}$",

If $n=3^{k} n^{\\prime}$, where $k \\geq 0$ is an integer and $n^{\\prime}$ is an integer not divisible by 3, then $d(n)=3^{-k}$.\nStep 3:  We are also given that the distance from house $n$ to house $m$, written $d(m, n)$, is simply $d(m-n)$. This means that the distance between two houses is the same as the distance between their house numbers.\nStep 4:  We are asked to find the possible values of $d(16, m)$ given that $d(17, m)=1 / 81$.\nStep 5:  To approach this problem, we need to use the given information and the properties of the distance function to find the possible values of $d(16, m)$.\nStep 6:  We can start by using the fact that $d(17, m)=1 / 81$ to find the possible values of $m$.\nStep 7:  Then, we can use the fact that $d(m, n)=d(m-n)$ to find the possible values of $d(16, m)$.\nStep 8:  By carefully applying these properties and using the given information, we can determine the possible values of $d(16, m)$.\n\nStep 9:  First, we need to find the possible values of $m$ given that $d(17, m)=1 / 81$.\nStep 10:  We know that $d(17, m)=d(17-m)$, so we can set $d(17-m)=1 / 81$.\nStep 11:  Since $d(n)=3^{-k}$, we can write $d(17-m)=3^{-k}$ for some integer $k$.\nStep 12:  This means that $17-m=3^{k}$ for some integer $k$.\nStep 13:  Solving for $m$, we get $m=17-3^{k}$.\nStep 14:  Now, we need to find the possible values of $d(16, m)$.\nStep 15:  We know that $d(16, m)=d(16-m)$, so we can set $d(16-m)=d(16-m)$.\nStep 16:  Since $d(n)=3^{-k}$, we can write $d(16-m)=3^{-k}$ for some integer $k$.\nStep 17:  This means that $16-m=3^{k}$ for some integer $k$.\nStep 18:  Solving for $m$, we get $m=16-3^{k}$.\nStep 19:  Now, we need to find the possible values of $d(16, m)$.\nStep 20:  We can use the fact that $d(m, n)=d(m-n)$ to find the possible values of $d(16, m)$.\nStep 21:  Since $m=16-3^{k}$, we can write $d(16, m)=d(16-(16-3^{k}))=d(3^{k})$.\nStep 22:  Using the property of $d(n)$, we can write $d(3^{k})=3^{-k}$.\nStep 23:  Therefore, the possible values of $d(16, m)$ are $3^{-k}$ for some integer $k$.\n\nStep 24:  Now, we need to find the possible values of $k$.\nStep 25:  We know that $m=17-3^{k}$ and $m=16-3^{k}$.\nStep 26:  Equating these two expressions, we get $17-3^{k}=16-3^{k}$.\nStep 27:  Simplifying, we get $1=0$, which is a contradiction.\nStep 28:  Therefore, there is no value of $k$ that satisfies both equations.\nStep 29:  However, we can try to find a value of $k$ that satisfies one of the equations.\nStep 30:  Let's try to find a value of $k$ that satisfies the equation $m=17-3^{k}$.\nStep 31:  We can try different values of $k$ to see if we can find a solution.\nStep 32:  If we try $k=4$, we get $m=17-3^{4}=17-81=-64$.\nStep 33:  This is a valid solution, so we have found a value of $k$ that satisfies the equation.\nStep 34:  Therefore, the possible value of $d(16, m)$ is $3^{-4}=1 / 81$.\n\nStep 35:  Now, we need to find the other possible value of $d(16, m)$.\nStep 36:  We can use the fact that $d(m, n)=d(m-n)$ to find the other possible value of $d(16, m)$.\nStep 37:  Since $m=16-3^{k}$, we can write $d(16, m)=d(16-(16-3^{k}))=d(3^{k})$.\nStep 38:  Using the property of $d(n)$, we can write $d(3^{k})=3^{-k}$.\nStep 39:  Therefore, the other possible value of $d(16, m)$ is $3^{-k}$ for some integer $k$.\nStep 40:  We can try different values of $k$ to see if we can find a solution.\nStep 41:  If we try $k=3$, we get $d(16, m)=3^{-3}=1 / 27$.\nStep 42:  This is a valid solution, so we have found another value of $d(16, m)$.\n\nStep 43:  Therefore, the possible values of $d(16, m)$ are $1 / 81$ and $1 / 27$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{81}, \\frac{1}{27}}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the given conditions and how they affect the distance between houses in ARMLopolis.\nStep 2:  The distance $d(n)$ between house $n$ and City Hall is not simply the value of $n$. Instead, if $n=3^{k} n^{\\prime}$, where $k \\geq 0$ is an integer and $n^{\\prime}$ is an integer not divisible by 3, then $d(n)=3^{-k}$.\nStep 3:  We are also given that the distance from house $n$ to house $m$, written $d(m, n)$, is simply $d(m-n)$. This means that the distance between two houses is the same as the distance between their house numbers.\nStep 4:  The neighborhood of a house $n$, written $\\mathcal{N}(n)$, is the set of all houses that are the same distance from City Hall as $n$. Geometrically, it may be helpful to think of $\\mathcal{N}(n)$ as a circle centered at City Hall with radius $d(n)$.\nStep 5:  Ross takes a walk starting at his house, which is number 34. He first visits house $n_{1}$, such that $d\\left(n_{1}, 34\\right)=1 / 3$. He then goes to another house, $n_{2}$, such that $d\\left(n_{1}, n_{2}\\right)=1 / 3$. Continuing in that way, he visits houses $n_{3}, n_{4}, \\ldots$, and each time, $d\\left(n_{i}, n_{i+1}\\right)=1 / 3$.\nStep 6:  We need to find the maximum possible distance from his original house after this walk.\nStep 7:  To do this, we need to consider the possible values of $n_{1}$ and how they affect the subsequent values of $n_{i}$.\nStep 8:  We can start by finding the possible values of $n_{1}$ such that $d\\left(n_{1}, 34\\right)=1 / 3$.\nStep 9:  We can then use these values to determine the subsequent values of $n_{i}$ and find the maximum possible distance from his original house.\nStep 10:  By considering the possible values of $n_{1}$ and their effects on the subsequent values of $n_{i}$, we can determine the maximum possible distance from his original house.\n\nStep 11:  The possible values of $n_{1}$ such that $d\\left(n_{1}, 34\\right)=1 / 3$ are $n_{1}=3^{2} \\cdot 11=99$ and $n_{1}=3^{2} \\cdot 10=90$.\nStep 12:  If $n_{1}=99$, then $n_{2}=3^{2} \\cdot

We can rewrite $3 / 5$ as $3^{0} \\cdot 3 / 5$, where neither 3 nor 5 is divisible by 3. Therefore, $d(3 / 5)=3^{-0}=1$.\nStep 5:  Similarly, to find $d(5 / 8)$, we express $5 / 8$ in the form $3^{k} n^{\\prime} / q^{\\prime}$. We can rewrite $5 / 8$ as $3^{-1} \\cdot 5 / 8$, where neither 5 nor 8 is divisible by 3.

We can rewrite $7 / 18$ as $3^{-1} \\cdot 7 / 6$, where neither 7 nor 6 is divisible by 3.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given trapezoid $A R M L$ and the information provided about the angles and the intersection of the diagonals.\nStep 2:  First, we're given that $M R=R A=A L$ and $L R=A M=M L$, which implies that the trapezoid is isosceles. This means that the diagonals $A M$ and $R L$ are congruent, and the angles opposite the congruent sides are also congruent.\nStep 3:  We're also given that point $P$ lies inside the trapezoid such that $\\angle R M P=12^{\\circ}$ and $\\angle R A P=6^{\\circ}$. We need to find the measure of angle $A P D$.\nStep 4:  To approach this, we can start by finding the measure of angle $A P R$. Since $\\angle R A P=6^{\\circ}$ and $\\angle R M P=12^{\\circ}$, we can use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is $180^{\\circ}$ to find the measure of angle $A P R$.\nStep 5:  We know that $\\angle A P R$ is the supplement of $\\angle R A P$, so $\\angle A P R=180^{\\circ}-6^{\\circ}=174^{\\circ}$.\nStep 6:  Next, we can use the fact that the diagonals of an isosceles trapezoid are congruent to find the measure of angle $A D P$. Since $A D$ is a diagonal of the trapezoid, we can use the fact that the diagonals of an isosceles trapezoid are congruent to find the measure of angle $A D P$.\nStep 7:  We know that $\\angle A D P$ is the supplement of $\\angle A P R$, so $\\angle A D P=180^{\\circ}-174^{\\circ}=6^{\\circ}$.\nStep 8:  Finally, we can use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is $180^{\\circ}$ to find the measure of angle $A P D$. We have $\\angle A P D=180^{\\circ}-\\angle A D P-\\angle A P R=180^{\\circ}-6^{\\circ}-174^{\\circ}=0^{\\circ}$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the measure of angle $A P D$ is $\\boxed{0}$ degrees.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",
  "Problem: A regular hexagon has side length 1. Compute the average of the areas of the 20 triangles whose vertices are vertices of the hexagon.\nStep 1:  To solve this problem, we need to start by understanding the properties of a regular hexagon and how we can divide it into triangles.\nStep 2:  A regular hexagon has 6 equal sides and 6 equal angles. We can divide it into 6 equilateral triangles by drawing lines from the center of the hexagon to each of its vertices.\nStep 3:  Each of these equilateral triangles has a side length of 1, as given in the problem.\nStep 4:  The area of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is given by the formula $\\frac{s^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4}$.\nStep 5:  Substituting $s = 1$ into the formula, we get the area of each equilateral triangle as $\\frac{1^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}$.\nStep 6:  Now, we need to find the average of the areas of the 20 triangles whose vertices are vertices of the hexagon.\nStep 7:  Since the hexagon can be divided into 6 equilateral triangles, and each of these triangles can be further divided into 3 smaller triangles, we have a total of $6 \\times 3 = 18$ smaller triangles.\nStep 8:  However, we are asked to find the average of the areas of the 20 triangles, which means we need to consider the areas of the 6 equilateral triangles and the 14 additional triangles formed by joining the midpoints of the sides of the hexagon.\nStep 9:  The 6 equilateral triangles have an area of $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}$ each, and the 14 additional triangles have an area of $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{8}$ each.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the average area of the 20 triangles is given by $\\frac{6 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} + 14 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{8}}{20}$.\nStep 11:  Simplifying this expression, we get $\\frac{3\\sqrt{3} + 7\\sqrt{3}/2}{20} = \\frac{6\\sqrt{3} + 7\\sqrt{3}}{40} = \\frac{13\\sqrt{3}}{40}$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the average of the areas of the 20 triangles is $\\frac{13\\sqrt{3}}{40}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{13\\sqrt{3}}{40}}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of mugs and shirts Paul was initially planning to buy.\nStep 2:  Let's assume the number of mugs Paul was planning to buy is represented by $m$ and the number of shirts is represented by $s$.\nStep 3:  We know that the total number of items Paul was planning to buy is 20, so we have the equation $m + s = 20$.\nStep 4:  Additionally, we are given that the cost of each mug is $\\$ 10$ and the cost of each shirt is $\\$ 6$.\nStep 5:  Paul decided to put $40 \\%$ of the mugs back, which means he will only buy $60 \\%$ of the mugs he initially planned to buy.\nStep 6:  This implies that the number of mugs he will buy is $0.6m$.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the total cost of the remaining items can be calculated as $0.6 \\times 10m + 6s$.\nStep 8:  We need to find the value of $0.6 \\times 10m + 6s$.\nStep 9:  To do this, we can use the equation $m + s = 20$ to express $s$ in terms of $m$, which gives us $s = 20 - m$.\nStep 10:  Substituting this expression for $s$ into the equation for the total cost, we get $0.6 \\times 10m + 6(20 - m)$.\nStep 11:  Simplifying this expression, we get $6m + 120 - 6m$, which equals $120$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the number of dollars Paul spent on the remaining items is $\\$ 120$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{120}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to find the prime factorization of 1584.\nStep 2:  The prime factorization of 1584 is $2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 11$.\nStep 3:  We are looking for the smallest positive integer $x$ such that $1584 \\cdot x$ is a perfect cube. This means that the prime factorization of $1584 \\cdot x$ must have each prime factor's exponent be a multiple of 3.\nStep 4:  From the prime factorization of 1584, we can see that the exponent of 2 is 3, the exponent of 3 is 2, and the exponent of 11 is 1.\nStep 5:  To make the exponent of 2 a multiple of 3, we need to multiply 1584 by a number that will increase the exponent of 2 to the next multiple of 3, which is 6. This means we need to multiply by $2^3 = 8$.\nStep 6:  To make the exponent of 3 a multiple of 3, we need to multiply 1584 by a number that will increase the exponent of 3 to the next multiple of 3, which is 3. This means we need to multiply by $3^1 = 3$.\nStep 7:  To make the exponent of 11 a multiple of 3, we need to multiply 1584 by a number that will increase the exponent of 11 to the next multiple of 3, which is 3. This means we need to multiply by $11^2 = 121$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the smallest positive integer $x$ such that $1584 \\cdot x$ is a perfect cube is $8 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 121 = 2912$.\nStep 9:  Now, we need to find the smallest positive integer $y$ such that $x y$ is a multiple of 1584. This means that $y$ must be a multiple of 1584.\nStep 10:  Since $x = 2912$, we need to find the smallest multiple of 1584 that is greater than or equal to 2912.\nStep 11:  The smallest multiple of 1584 that is greater than or equal to 2912 is 1584 itself.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the smallest positive integer $y$ such that $x y$ is a multiple of 1584 is $y = \\frac{1584}{2912} \\cdot 1584 = \\boxed{1584}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1584}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first understand the given information and what is being asked. Emma buys 5 apples and 5 peaches, pays with a $\\$ 5$ bill, and receives some change. Jonah buys 2 apples and 12 peaches, pays with a single $\\$ 10$ bill, and also receives some change. Finally, Helen buys 25 peaches, and we need to find the least amount of money she can expect to pay in cents.\nStep 2:  Let's denote the price of an apple as $a$ cents and the price of a peach as $p$ cents. We are given that $5a + 5p = 500$ and $2a + 12p = 1000$. We need to find the least amount of money Helen can expect to pay, which is $25p$.\nStep 3:  To solve for $p$, we can use the given equations. First, we can multiply the second equation by $5$ to get $10a + 60p = 5000$. Then, we can subtract the first equation from this new equation to get $5a + 55p = 4500$.\nStep 4:  Next, we can multiply the first equation by $2$ to get $10a + 10p = 1000$. Subtracting this from the equation $5a + 55p = 4500$ gives us $45p = 3500$, which simplifies to $p = 77.78$. However, since the price of each fruit must be an integer, we need to find the least integer value of $p$ that satisfies the given conditions.\nStep 5:  We can find the least integer value of $p$ by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of $5a + 5p = 500$ and $2a + 12p = 1000$. The GCD is $5$, so we can divide both equations by $5$ to get $a + p = 100$ and $a + 6p = 200$.\nStep 6:  Subtracting the first equation from the second equation gives us $5p = 100$, which simplifies to $p = 20$. Therefore, the least amount of money Helen can expect to pay is $25p = 25 \\times 20 = \\boxed{500}$ cents.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{500}$",

This similarity allows us to establish a relationship between the sides of these triangles.\nStep 6:  We can use the similarity of the triangles to find the length of $PQ$, which is the distance from $P$ to the chord $\\overline{A B}$.\nStep 7:  Once we have the length of $PQ$, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of $PA$ and $PB$.\nStep 8:  Finally, we can use the lengths of $PA$ and $PB$ to compute the value of $P A^{2}+P B^{2}$.\nStep 9:  By carefully applying the properties of similar triangles and the Pythagorean Theorem, we can find the required value of $P A^{2}+P B^{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{232}$",

We know that $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{x}{2}\\right\\rfloor$ takes on the value $n$ when $2n \\le x < 2n + 1$, and $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{x}{3}\\right\\rfloor$ takes on the value $m$ when $3m \\le x < 3m + 1$.\nStep 4:  We then analyze the equation $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{x}{2}\\right\\rfloor-\\left\\lfloor\\frac{x}{3}\\right\\rfloor=\\frac{x}{7}$ by considering the possible values of $n$ and $m$ that satisfy the equation.\nStep 5:  We find that the equation holds when $x$ is in the interval $[14,15)$, and we can solve for $x$ in this interval to find the values that satisfy the equation.\nStep 6:  By solving for $x$ in the interval $[14,15)$, we find that the values of $x$ that satisfy the equation are $x = 14 + \\frac{7}{15}k$, where $k$ is an integer.\nStep 7:  We then need to find the sum of all these values of $x$ to get the final answer.\nStep 8:  The sum of the values of $x$ is given by the expression $\\sum_{k=0}^{14} \\left(14 + \\frac{7}{15}k\\right)$.\nStep 9:  We can simplify this expression to find the sum of all the values of $x$ that satisfy the equation.\nStep 10:  After simplifying the expression, we find that the sum of all the values of $x$ is $\\frac{15 \\cdot 14 + 7 \\cdot 15 \\cdot 15}{4}$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the sum of all real numbers $x$ that satisfy the equation is $\\frac{15 \\cdot 14 + 7 \\cdot 15 \\cdot 15}{4}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{15 \\cdot 14 + 7 \\cdot 15 \\cdot 15}{4}}",

  "Step 1:  To solve the given expression, we first need to understand the properties of logarithms and exponents.\nStep 2:  The expression $2^{\\log _{T} 8}-8^{\\log _{T} 2}$ involves logarithms and exponents, so we'll start by simplifying the logarithmic terms using the properties of logarithms.\nStep 3:  We know that $\\log _{a} b = c$ is equivalent to $a^c = b$. Using this property, we can rewrite the given expression as $2^{\\log _{T} 8}-8^{\\log _{T} 2} = 2^{\\log _{T} 8} - 8^{\\log _{T} 2}$.\nStep 4:  Now, we can use the property of logarithms that states $\\log _{a} b^c = c \\log _{a} b$. Applying this property, we get $\\log _{T} 8 = \\log _{T} (2^3) = 3 \\log _{T} 2$.\nStep 5:  Similarly, we have $\\log _{T} 2 = \\log _{T} (2^1) = 1 \\log _{T} 2 = \\log _{T} 2$.\nStep 6:  Substituting these values back into the expression, we get $2^{\\log _{T} 8} - 8^{\\log _{T} 2} = 2^{3 \\log _{T} 2} - 8^{\\log _{T} 2}$.\nStep 7:  Now, we can simplify the expression further by using the property of exponents that states $a^{b \\log a} = a^b$.\nStep 8:  Applying this property, we get $2^{3 \\log _{T} 2} - 8^{\\log _{T} 2} = 2^3 - 8^{\\log _{T} 2}$.\nStep 9:  We know that $2^3 = 8$, so the expression becomes $8 - 8^{\\log _{T} 2}$.\nStep 10:  Now, we can simplify the term $8^{\\log _{T} 2}$ by using the property of logarithms that states $\\log _{a} b = c$ is equivalent to $a^c = b$.\nStep 11:  Applying this property, we get $8^{\\log _{T} 2} = T^{\\log _{T} 2 \\cdot \\log _{T} 8} = T^{\\log _{T} 2 \\cdot 3 \\log _{T} 2} = T^{3(\\log _{T} 2)^2}$.\nStep 12:  Substituting this value back into the expression, we get $8 - 8^{\\log _{T} 2} = 8 - T^{3(\\log _{T} 2)^2}$.\nStep 13:  Now, we can simplify the expression further by using the property of logarithms that states $\\log _{a} b = c$ is equivalent to $a^c = b$.\nStep 14:  Applying this property, we get $8 - T^{3(\\log _{T} 2)^2} = 8 - (T^{\\log _{T} 2})^3 = 8 - 2^3$.\nStep 15:  Therefore, the final answer is $8 - 8 = \\boxed{0}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",
  "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n## Step 1: Define the variables and the given information\nLet's denote the number of traffic warnings issued as $T+2$, the number of tickets issued as 20, and the number of arrests made as $T+5$. We are also given that the combined number of tickets and arrests should be 20 times the number of warnings issued.\n\n## Step 2: Write an equation representing the given information\nThe combined number of tickets and arrests is $(T+2) + (T+5) = 2T + 7$. This should be equal to 20 times the number of warnings issued, which is $20(T+2) = 20T + 40$.\n\n## Step 3: Set up the equation to solve for T\nWe can set up the equation $2T + 7 = 20T + 40$ to solve for $T$.\n\n## Step 4: Solve the equation for T\nSubtracting $2T$ from both sides of the equation gives $7 = 18T + 40$. Subtracting 40 from both sides gives $-33 = 18T$. Dividing both sides by 18 gives $T = -\\frac{33}{18} = -\\frac{11}{6}$.\n\n## Step 5: Find the number of tickets that must be issued\nSince the number of tickets issued is 20, and we need to find how many more tickets must be issued, we can set up the equation $20 + x = 20T + 40$, where $x$ is the number of additional tickets that must be issued.\n\n## Step 6: Solve for x\nSubstituting $T = -\\frac{11}{6}$ into the equation gives $20 + x = 20(-\\frac{11}{6}) + 40$. Simplifying the right-hand side gives $20 + x = -\\frac{220}{6} + 40$. Converting 40 to a fraction with a denominator of 6 gives $20 + x = -\\frac{220}{6} + \\frac{240}{6}$. Combining the fractions gives $20 + x = \\frac{20}{6}$. Subtracting 20 from both sides gives $x = \\frac{20}{6} - 20$. Converting 20 to a fraction with a denominator of 6 gives $x = \\frac{20}{6} - \\frac{120}{6}$. Combining the fractions gives $x = -\\frac{100}{6}$.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the answer\nSimplifying the fraction gives $x = -\\frac{50}{3}$.\n\n## Step 8: Convert the answer to a positive number\nSince we are looking for the number of additional tickets that must be issued, we can convert the answer to a positive number by taking the absolute value. $x = \\left|-\\frac{50}{3}\\right| = \\frac{50}{3}$.\n\n## Step 9: Write the final answer\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{50}{3}}$",

In this case, the bases of the trapezoid $PQWZ$ are $\\frac{1}{3}AR$ and $\\frac{2}{5}ML$, and the height is the distance between the parallel sides $PQ$ and $WZ$.\nStep 5:  We can use the given information about the trisection of $\\overline{AR}$ and the division of $\\overline{ML}$ into fifths to find the lengths of the bases of the trapezoid $PQWZ$.\nStep 6:  The length of $\\overline{PQ}$ is $\\frac{1}{3}AR$, and the length of $\\overline{WZ}$ is $\\frac{2}{5}ML$. The height of the trapezoid is the distance between the parallel sides $PQ$ and $WZ$, which is the same as the height of the parallelogram $ARM L$.\nStep 7:  Using the formula for the area of a trapezoid, we can calculate the area of $PQWZ$ as $\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{3}AR + \\frac{2}{5}ML\\right)\\cdot\\frac{1}{3}AR$.\nStep 8:  We know that $[ARM L] = T$, so we can substitute this value into the formula to find the area of $PQWZ$ in terms of $T$.\nStep 9:  After simplifying the expression, we find that $[PQWZ] = \\frac{1}{6}T$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the area of the trapezoid $PQWZ$ is $\\frac{1}{6}$ of the area of the parallelogram $ARM L$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$",

Since $T = T N Y W R$, we can calculate the value of $T$ by multiplying the individual digits: $T = 2 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 = 1440$.\nStep 3:  Next, we need to find the prime factorization of $T+10$. We have $T+10 = 1440 + 10 = 1450$. The prime factorization of $1450$ is $2 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 29$.\nStep 4:  Now, we need to find the prime factorization of $(T+10)!$. We know that $(T+10)! = 1450!$. The prime factorization of $1450!$ will include all the prime factors of $1450$, which are $2$, $5$, and $29$.\nStep 5:  To find the number of positive perfect cubes that are divisors of $(T+10)!$, we need to find the number of perfect cubes that can be formed using the prime factors of $1450!$.

We know that the graph intersects the $x$-axis at these points, so their $y$-coordinates are both $0$. We can use the equation of the graph to find the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $M$.\nStep 4:  The equation of the graph is $y=x^{2}+2 x-T$. Setting $y=0$, we get $x^{2}+2 x-T=0$. This is a quadratic equation in $x$, and we can solve for $x$ using the quadratic formula.\nStep 5:  The quadratic formula states that for an equation of the form $ax^{2}+bx+c=0$, the solutions for $x$ are given by $x=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}$. In this case, $a=1$, $b=2$, and $c=-T$.\nStep 6:  Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get $x=\\frac{-2\\pm\\sqrt{2^{2}-4(1)(-T)}}{2(1)}=\\frac{-2\\pm\\sqrt{4+4T}}{2}=-1\\pm\\sqrt{1+T}$.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $M$ are $-1+\\sqrt{1+T}$ and $-1-\\sqrt{1+T}$, respectively.\nStep 8:  Since $A$ and $M$ are diagonally opposite vertices of a square, the length of the side of the square is the difference between their $x$-coordinates, which is $2\\sqrt{1+T}$.\nStep 9:  The area of a square is given by the formula $[A R M L]=(\\text{side length})^{2}$.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the recursive definition of the sequence $a_n$ and then compute the sum of the squares of the first $T-3$ terms of the sequence.\nStep 2:  We are given that the first two terms of the sequence are $a_{1}=3 / 5$ and $a_{2}=4 / 5$. For $n>2$, if $n$ is odd, then $a_{n}=a_{n-1}^{2}-a_{n-2}^{2}$, while if $n$ is even, then $a_{n}=2 a_{n-2} a_{n-3}$.\nStep 3:  We are asked to find the sum of the squares of the first $T-3$ terms of the sequence, where $T$ is defined as $T=T N Y W R$.\nStep 4:  To start, we need to calculate the first few terms of the sequence using the given recursive definition.\nStep 5:  We find that $a_3 = a_2^2 - a_1^2 = \\frac{16}{25} - \\frac{9}{25} = \\frac{7}{25}$, and $a_4 = 2a_2a_1 = \\frac{24}{25}$.\nStep 6:  Next, we calculate $a_5$ and $a_6$ using the recursive definition, and we find that $a_5 = \\frac{7}{25}$ and $a_6 = \\frac{48}{125}$.\nStep 7:  We then notice that the sequence becomes periodic from this point, with a period of length 4, and the terms repeat in the order $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4$.\nStep 8:  We can use this periodicity to simplify the calculation of the sum of the squares of the first $T-3$ terms of the sequence.\nStep 9:  Since the period has length 4, we can express $T-3$ as $4q+r$, where $q$ is the quotient and $r$ is the remainder when $T-3$ is divided by 4.\nStep 10:  We then calculate the sum of the squares of the first $T-3$ terms of the sequence by considering the sum of the squares of the first $r$ terms of the sequence.\nStep 11:  This involves calculating the sum of the squares of the first $r$ terms of the sequence, which can be expressed as $\\sum_{i=1}^r a_i^2$.\nStep 12:  We can then simplify this expression using the periodicity of the sequence and the values of $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4$.\nStep 13:  After simplifying the expression, we can calculate the final value of the sum of the squares of the first $T-3$ terms of the sequence.\nStep 14:  Therefore, we can find the sum of the squares of the first $T-3$ terms of the sequence by following these steps.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{118}{125}}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given information and what is being asked. We are given an arithmetic sequence $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, \\ldots$, with $a_{16}=13$ and $a_{30}=20$. We are asked to find the value of $k$ for which $a_{k}=T$, where $T$ is defined as $T=T N Y W R$.\nStep 2:  The first step is to find the common difference of the arithmetic sequence. We can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence, which is $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$, where $a_n$ is the nth term, $a_1$ is the first term, $n$ is the term number, and $d$ is the common difference.\nStep 3:  We are given that $a_{16}=13$ and $a_{30}=20$. Using the formula, we can set up the equations $13 = a_1 + 15d$ and $20 = a_1 + 29d$.\nStep 4:  Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get $7 = 14d$, which gives us the common difference $d = \\frac{7}{14} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nStep 5:  Now that we have the common difference, we can find the value of $a_1$ by substituting $d$ into one of the original equations. Let's use $13 = a_1 + 15d$. Substituting $d = \\frac{1}{2}$, we get $13 = a_1 + 15 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}$, which simplifies to $13 = a_1 + \\frac{15}{2}$. Solving for $a_1$, we get $a_1 = 13 - \\frac{15}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nStep 6:  Now that we have the first term $a_1$ and the common difference $d$, we can find the value of $a_k$ using the formula $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$. We want to find $k$ such that $a_k = T$, where $T$ is defined as $T=T N Y W R$.\nStep 7:  Since $T$ is not a numerical value, we need to find the value of $k$ that satisfies the equation $a_k = T$. However, we are given that $T$ is equal to $T N Y W R$, which is not a numerical value. Therefore, we cannot directly find the value of $k$ using the given information.\nStep 8:  However, we can use the fact that the sequence is arithmetic and the common difference is $\\frac{1}{2}$ to find the value of $k$ that satisfies the equation $a_k = T$. Since $T$ is not a numerical value, we can assume that $T$ is equal to the value of $a_k$ when $k$ is equal to a specific value.\nStep 9:  Let's assume that $T$ is equal to the value of $a_k$ when $k$ is equal to $k_0$. Then, we can use the formula $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$ to find the value of $k_0$.\nStep 10:  We know that $a_{16}=13$ and $a_{30}=20$, so we can use these values to find the value of $k_0$.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given condition and how it relates to the set $\\mathcal{S}$ of real polynomials $A(x)$ with leading coefficient 1.\nStep 2:  The condition provided is that there exists a real polynomial $B(x)$ such that the equation $\\frac{1}{A(x)}+\\frac{1}{B(x)}+\\frac{1}{x+10}=\\frac{1}{x}$ holds for all real numbers $x$ for which $A(x) \\neq 0, B(x) \\neq 0$, and $x \\neq-10,0$.\nStep 3:  We can start by manipulating the given equation to gain insights into the properties of $A(x)$ and $B(x)$.\nStep 4:  Multiplying both sides of the equation by $xA(x)B(x)$, we get $B(x) + A(x) + xA(x) = xB(x)$.\nStep 5:  Rearranging the terms, we have $xA(x) - xB(x) + A(x) + B(x) = 0$.\nStep 6:  Factoring out $x$, we get $x(A(x) - B(x)) + (A(x) + B(x)) = 0$.\nStep 7:  This equation can be further simplified to $x(A(x) - B(x)) = - (A(x) + B(x))$.\nStep 8:  We can then express $A(x) - B(x)$ as $-\\frac{A(x) + B(x)}{x}$.\nStep 9:  Since $A(x)$ and $B(x)$ are polynomials, we can express $A(x) - B(x)$ as a polynomial $C(x)$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, we have $C(x) = -\\frac{A(x) + B(x)}{x}$.\nStep 11:  This implies that $A(x) + B(x) = -xC(x)$.\nStep 12:  We can then express $A(x)$ as $-\\frac{xC(x)}{2} + \\frac{B(x)}{2}$.\nStep 13:  Since the leading coefficient of $A(x)$ is 1, we can conclude that $C(x)$ must be a constant polynomial.\nStep 14:  Let's denote this constant as $C$.\nStep 15:  Therefore, we have $A(x) = -\\frac{x}{2}C + \\frac{B(x)}{2}$.\nStep 16:  We can then express $B(x)$ as $2A(x) + xC$.\nStep 17:  Substituting this expression for $B(x)$ into the original equation, we get $\\frac{1}{A(x)} + \\frac{1}{2A(x) + xC} + \\frac{1}{x+10} = \\frac{1}{x}$.\nStep 18:  Multiplying both sides by $x(2A(x) + xC)(x+10)$, we get $(2A(x) + xC)(x+10) + x(2A(x) + xC) + x(2A(x) + xC)(x+10) = x(2A(x) + xC)(x+10)$.\nStep 19:  Simplifying this equation, we get $(2A(x) + xC)(x+10) + 2xA(x) + x^2C + 2xA(x) + x^2C + 10xA(x) + 10xC = 2xA(x)(x+10) + x^2C(x+10)$.\nStep 20:  Combining like terms, we get $(2A(x) + xC)(x+10) + 4xA(x) + 2x^2C + 10xC = 2xA(x)(x+10) + x^2C(x+10)$.\nStep 21:  Expanding the left-hand side, we get $2A(x)(x+10) + x^2C + 10xC + 4xA(x) + 2x^2C = 2xA(x)(x+10) + x^2C(x+10)$.\nStep 22:  Simplifying further, we get $2A(x)(x+10) + 4xA(x) + 12xC + x^2C = 2xA(x)(x+10) + x^2C(x+10)$.\nStep 23:  Cancelling out the common terms, we get $12xC + x^2C = x^2C(x+10)$.\nStep 24:  Dividing both sides by $x^2C$, we get $12 + \\frac{C}{C} = x+10$.\nStep 25:  Simplifying, we get $12 + 1 = x+10$.\nStep 26:  Therefore, we have $x = 3$.\nStep 27:  Substituting this value of $x$ into the expression for $A(x)$, we get $A(3) = -\\frac{3}{2}C + \\frac{B(3)}{2}$.\nStep 28:  Since $B(x) = 2A(x) + xC$, we have $B(3) = 2A(3) + 3C$.\nStep 29:  Substituting this expression for $B(3)$ into the expression for $A(3)$, we get $A(3) = -\\frac{3}{2}C + \\frac{2A(3) + 3C}{2}$.\nStep 30:  Simplifying, we get $A(3) = -\\frac{3}{2}C + A(3) + \\frac{3}{2}C$.\nStep 31:  Cancelling out the common terms, we get $A(3) = A(3)$.\nStep 32:  This equation is true for all values of $A(3)$, so we can conclude that $A(3)$ can be any real number.\nStep 33:  Therefore, the sum of all possible values of $A(3)$ is the sum of all real numbers, which is undefined.\nStep 34:  However, we can still find the sum of all possible values of $A(10)$ by substituting $x=10$ into the expression for $A(x)$.\nStep 35:  We get $A(10) = -\\frac{10}{2}C + \\frac{B(10)}{2}$.\nStep 36:  Since $B(x) = 2A(x) + xC$, we have $B(10) = 2A(10) + 10C$.\nStep 37:  Substituting this expression for $B(10)$ into the expression for $A(10)$, we get $A(10) = -\\frac{10}{2}C + \\frac{2A(10) + 10C}{2}$.\nStep 38:  Simplifying, we get $A(10) = -\\frac{10}{2}C + A(10) + \\frac{10}{2}C$.\nStep 39:  Cancelling out the common terms, we get $A(10) = A(10)$.\nStep 40:  This equation is true for all values of $A(10)$, so we can conclude that $A(10)$ can be any real number.\nStep 41:  Therefore, the sum of all possible values of $A(10)$ is the sum of all real numbers, which is undefined.\nStep 42:  However, we can still find the sum of all possible values of $A(10)$ by considering the possible values of $C$.\nStep 43:  Since $C$ is a constant polynomial, it can take on any real value.\nStep 44:  Therefore, the sum of all possible values of $A(10)$ is the sum of all possible values of $-\\frac{10}{2}C + \\frac{2A(10) + 10C}{2}$.\nStep 45:  Simplifying, we get the sum of all possible values of $A(10)$ is the sum of all possible values of $-\\frac{10}{2}C + A(10) + \\frac{10}{2}C$.\nStep 46:  Cancelling out the common terms, we get the sum of all possible values of $A(10)$ is the sum of all possible values of $A(10)$.\nStep 47:  This equation is true for all values of $A(10)$, so we can conclude that the sum of all possible values of $A(10)$ is the sum of all real numbers, which is undefined.\nStep 48:  However, we can still find the sum of all possible values of $A(10)$ by considering the possible values of $A(x)$.\nStep 49:  Since $A(x)$ is a polynomial, it can take on any real value for a given $x$.\nStep 50:  Therefore, the sum of all possible values of $A(10)$ is the sum of all possible values of $-\\frac{10}{2}C + \\frac{2A(10) + 10C}{2}$.\nStep 51:  Simplifying, we get the sum of all possible values of

Points $M, N, O$, and $P$ lie on the sides of the square, forming a rectangle $M N O P$.\nStep 2:  We are asked to find the length of $M N$, which is the side length of the rectangle $M N O P$.\nStep 3:  To approach this problem, we can start by considering the properties of the square and the rectangle. Since $M N O P$ is a rectangle, we know that its opposite sides are equal in length and its diagonals are equal in length.\nStep 4:  We can also use the fact that the area of a square is equal to the square of its side length. Given that the area of square $A B C D$ is $T=36$, we can find the side length of the square by taking the square root of the area.\nStep 5:  Once we have the side length of the square, we can use the properties of the rectangle to find the length of $M N$.\nStep 6:  We can use the fact that the diagonals of a rectangle are equal in length and bisect each other to find the length of $M N$.\nStep 7:  By using these properties and the given information, we can calculate the length of $M N$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$",

This can be calculated using combinations, denoted as $\\binom{n}{r}$, which represents the number of ways to choose r items from a set of n items without considering the order.\nStep 3:  For Aditya, the number of ways to choose 2 letters from the first half of the alphabet is $\\binom{13}{2}$, and the number of ways to choose 2 letters from the second half is also $\\binom{13}{2}$. Therefore, the total number of ways for Aditya to choose 2 letters from each half is $\\binom{13}{2} \\times \\binom{13}{2}$.\nStep 4:  Similarly, for Ayesha, the number of ways to choose 2 letters from the first half of the alphabet is also $\\binom{13}{2}$, and the number of ways to choose 2 letters from the second half is also $\\binom{13}{2}$. Therefore, the total number of ways for Ayesha to choose 2 letters from each half is $\\binom{13}{2} \\times \\binom{13}{2}$.\nStep 5:  Now, we need to find the number of ways Aditya and Ayesha can choose the same set of four letters. This can be calculated by finding the number of ways to choose 4 letters from the entire alphabet, which is $\\binom{26}{4}$.\nStep 6:  The probability that Aditya and Ayesha choose the same set of four letters is then given by the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes (choosing the same set of four letters) to the total number of possible outcomes (choosing any set of four letters).\nStep 7:  Therefore, the probability is $\\frac{\\binom{26}{4}}{\\left( \\binom{13}{2} \\right)^2}$.\nStep 8:  Calculating this, we get $\\frac{12650}{4225} = \\frac{2530}{845}$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the probability that Aditya and Ayesha choose the same set of four letters is $\\frac{2530}{845}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{2530}{845}}$",

Two numbers are relatively prime if their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1. In other words, they have no common factors other than 1.\n\nNow, let's consider a sequence of $n$ consecutive positive integers. Since $n=7$, we have a sequence of 7 consecutive integers.\n\nTo maximize the number of cromulent elements, we want as many numbers as possible to be relatively prime to each other.

The seventh number is 7, which is relatively prime to all other numbers.\n\nSo, the maximum possible number of cromulent elements in a sequence of 7 consecutive positive integers is 5 (1, 2, 5, 7, and 6 is not cromulent because it shares a common factor with 2 and 3).\n\nTo minimize the number of cromulent elements, we want as few numbers as possible to be relatively prime to each other. This means we want to include numbers that share common factors with each other.\n\nThe first number in the sequence is 1, which is relatively prime to all other numbers. However, the second number is 2, which is also relatively prime to all other numbers. But the third number is 3, which shares a common factor with 1 and 2.

  "Step 1:  To find the least integer value of the function $f(x)=\\frac{x^{4}-6 x^{3}+2 x^{2}-6 x+2}{x^{2}+1}$, we first need to understand the nature of the function and its behavior.\nStep 2:  The function $f(x)$ is a rational function, which means it is the ratio of two polynomials. The numerator is a quartic polynomial, and the denominator is a quadratic polynomial.\nStep 3:  We are interested in finding the least integer value of this function, which implies that we need to find the minimum value of the function.\nStep 4:  To do this, we can start by analyzing the behavior of the function as $x$ becomes large in magnitude. This can be done by looking at the leading terms of the numerator and denominator.\nStep 5:  The leading term of the numerator is $x^{4}$, and the leading term of the denominator is $x^{2}$. Therefore, as $x$ becomes large in magnitude, the leading terms dominate the behavior of the function.\nStep 6:  This means that for large values of $x$, the function behaves like $\\frac{x^{4}}{x^{2}}=x^{2}$.\nStep 7:  Since $x^{2}$ is always nonnegative, the function $f(x)$ is also nonnegative for all real values of $x$.\nStep 8:  Now, we need to find the least integer value of the function.

Since the mode is unique, the other two numbers must be $n-1$ and $n+1$. This is because the mode is the number that appears most frequently, and in this case, it's the only number that appears more than once.\nStep 4:  The mean of the three numbers is $\\frac{n-1+n+n+1}{3} = \\frac{3n}{3} = n$.

The length of the diagonal $L E$ is given as $5 \\sqrt{2}$, and we are required to find the area of the triangular face $[L E O]$.\nStep 2:  The first step is to find the side length of the base $E O J S$. Since the area of the base is given as $T=4$, we can use the formula for the area of a square, which is side length squared. Therefore, the side length of the base is $\\sqrt{T} = \\sqrt{4} = 2$.\nStep 3:  Next, we need to find the length of the diagonal $E O$. Since the base is a square, the diagonal $E O$ is equal to the side length multiplied by $\\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, $E O = 2 \\cdot \\sqrt{2} = 2 \\sqrt{2}$.\nStep 4:  Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height of the pyramid. The height is the leg of a right triangle with hypotenuse $L E$ and base $E O$. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have $L E^2 = E O^2 + H^2$, where $H$ is the height of the pyramid. Substituting the given values, we get $5^2 \\cdot 2 = (2 \\sqrt{2})^2 + H^2$, which simplifies to $50 = 8 + H^2$. Solving for $H$, we find $H^2 = 42$, and taking the square root gives us $H = \\sqrt{42}$.\nStep 5:  Finally, we can find the area of the triangular face $[L E O]$ using the formula for the area of a triangle, which is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\text{base} \\cdot \\text{height}$.

Since $T-2=5$, the units digit of $5$ raised to any power is always $5$, so the units digit of $(T-2)^{20}$ is $5$.\nStep 5:  Finally, we find the units digit of $(T+10)^{23}$. Since $T+10=17$, the units digit of $17$ raised to any power is always $7$, so the units digit of $(T+10)^{23}$ is $7$.\nStep 6:  Now, we can substitute these units digits back into the original expression to find the units digit of the entire expression.\nStep 7:  The units digit of $T^{2023}+(T-2)^{20}-(T+10)^{23}$ is $7+5-7=5$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the units digit of the given expression is $\\boxed{5}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$",

  "We are given that $T=75$. We are also given that if the entering class had two more students, there would be $T$ more ways of selecting the two slide rule oilers. This means that the number of ways of selecting the two slide rule oilers is $T$ more than the number of ways of selecting the two slide rule oilers from the current number of students. We can write this as an equation: $\\binom{n+2}{2} - \\binom{n}{2} = T$. We can simplify this equation by expanding the binomial coefficients: $\\frac{(n+2)(n+1)}{2} - \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} = T$. We can multiply both sides of the equation by $2$ to eliminate the fractions: $(n+2)(n+1) - n(n-1) = 2T$. We can expand the left-hand side of the equation: $n^2 + 3n + 2 - n^2 + n = 2T$. We can combine like terms: $4n + 2 = 2T$. We can substitute $T=75$ into the equation: $4n + 2 = 150$. We can subtract $2$ from both sides of the equation: $4n = 148$. We can divide both sides of the equation by $4$: $n = 37$.\n\\boxed{37}",

This means that the angles are increasing by $123^{\\circ}$ each time.\nStep 3:  We want to find the smallest value of $n$ such that the set contains at least one angle in each of the four quadrants.

The next angle in the set is $246^{\\circ}$, which falls in the third quadrant. The next angle after that is $369^{\\circ}$, which falls in the fourth quadrant.\nStep 6:  We can see that the angles in the set are increasing by $123^{\\circ}$ each time, so we can find the next angle in the set by adding $123^{\\circ}$ to the previous angle.\nStep 7:  We can continue this process until we find the smallest value of $n$ such that the set contains at least one angle in each of the four quadrants.\nStep 8:  By analyzing the angles in the set and their corresponding values of $n$, we can determine the smallest value of $n$ that satisfies the condition.\nStep 9:  After analyzing the angles in the set and their corresponding values of $n$, we find that the smallest value of $n$ such that the set contains at least one angle in each of the four quadrants is $n = \\boxed{5}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the constraints and requirements for creating a valid ARMLvanian license plate.\nStep 2:  We are given that the license plates use only the digits 1-9, and each plate contains exactly $T-3$ digits, where $T=11$. This means each plate will have 8 digits.\nStep 3:  The problem states that all digits on the plate are distinct, and for all $k \\leq T-3$, the $k^{\\text {th }}$ digit is at least $k$. This implies that the first digit can be any of the 9 digits, the second digit can be any of the remaining 8 digits, and so on.\nStep 4:  We need to find the number of valid ARMLvanian license plates, which means we need to count the number of ways to choose 8 distinct digits from the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\\}$, such that the $k^{\\text {th }}$ digit is at least $k$ for all $k \\leq 8$.\nStep 5:  To approach this, we can use the concept of permutations, as the order of the digits matters.\nStep 6:  We can start by choosing the first digit, which can be any of the 9 digits. Then, for the second digit, we have 8 choices, as it must be greater than the first digit. Similarly, for the third digit, we have 7 choices, and so on.\nStep 7:  This gives us a total of $9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2$ ways to choose the 8 digits.\nStep 8:  However, we need to consider the constraint that the $k^{\\text {th }}$ digit is at least $k$ for all $k \\leq 8$. This means that the first digit can be any of the 9 digits, but the second digit must be at least 2, the third digit must be at least 3, and so on.\nStep 9:  This constraint affects the number of choices for each digit, and we need to take this into account when calculating the total number of valid license plates.\nStep 10:  We can use the concept of permutations with constraints to solve this problem.\nStep 11:  The number of valid ARMLvanian license plates is given by the expression $9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the number of valid ARMLvanian license plates is $9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{181440}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{181440}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of getting a sum of 20 or 12 when rolling a seventeen-sided die twice.\nStep 2:  First, let's consider the possible outcomes for each roll. The die has faces numbered 1 through 17, but it's not fair, with 17 coming up with a probability of $1 / 2$ and each of the numbers 1 through 16 coming up with a probability of $1 / 32$.\nStep 3:  We're interested in the sum of two rolls, so we need to consider all possible pairs of rolls that result in a sum of 20 or 12.\nStep 4:  To calculate the probability of getting a sum of 20, we need to find all pairs of rolls that add up to 20. These pairs are (17,3), (3,17), (16,4), (4,16), (15,5), (5,15), (14,6), (6,14), (13,7), (7,13), (12,8), (8,12), (11,9), (9,11), and (10,10).\nStep 5:  Similarly, to calculate the probability of getting a sum of 12, we need to find all pairs of rolls that add up to 12. These pairs are (17, -5), (16, -4), (15, -3), (14, -2), (13, -1), (12, 0), (11, 1), (10, 2), (9, 3), (8, 4), (7, 5), (6, 6), (5, 7), (4, 8), (3, 9), (2, 10), (1, 11), and (0, 12).\nStep 6:  However, since the die doesn't have negative numbers, we can disregard the pairs with negative numbers.\nStep 7:  Now, we need to calculate the probability of each of these pairs occurring. The probability of each pair is the product of the individual probabilities of each roll.\nStep 8:  For the pairs (17,3), (3,17), (16,4), (4,16), (15,5), (5,15), (14,6), (6,14), (13,7), (7,13), (12,8), (8,12), (11,9), (9,11), and (10,10), the probability of each pair is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{32} = \\frac{1}{64}$.\nStep 9:  For the pairs (16, -4), (15, -3), (14, -2), (13, -1), (12, 0), (11, 1), (10, 2), (9, 3), (8, 4), (7, 5), (6, 6), (5, 7), (4, 8), (3, 9), (2, 10), (1, 11), and (0, 12), the probability of each pair is $\\frac{1}{32} \\cdot 0 = 0$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the total probability of getting a sum of 20 or 12 is the sum of the probabilities of all these pairs.\nStep 11:  There are 15 pairs that result in a sum of 20, each with a probability of $\\frac{1}{64}$, and 16 pairs that result in a sum of 12, each with a probability of 0.\nStep 12:  So, the total probability is $15 \\cdot \\frac{1}{64} = \\frac{15}{64}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{15}{64}}",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand what an arithmetic sequence is. An arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers in which the difference between any two consecutive terms is constant. This constant difference is called the common difference.\nStep 2:  We are given that the first term of the sequence, $a_1$, is 10, and the term at position $a_2$ is 100. We need to find the value of the term at position $a_{a_3}$.\nStep 3:  The common difference between consecutive terms in the sequence is denoted by $d$. We can use the formula for the $n$th term of an arithmetic sequence, which is $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$, to find the value of $d$.\nStep 4:  We know that $a_2 = 100$, so we can use the formula to express $a_2$ in terms of $a_1$ and $d$: $a_2 = a_1 + d$. Substituting the given values, we get $100 = 10 + d$, which gives us $d = 90$.\nStep 5:  Now that we have the common difference, we can find the value of $a_3$ using the formula $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$. Substituting $n=3$, we get $a_3 = 10 + 2(90) = 190$.\nStep 6:  Next, we need to find the value of $a_{a_3}$. This means we need to find the term at position $a_3$ in the sequence. We can use the formula $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$ again, but this time we'll substitute $n = a_3 = 190$ to find the value of $a_{a_3}$.\nStep 7:  Substituting $n = 190$ into the formula, we get $a_{a_3} = 10 + (190-1)90 = 10 + 17100 = 17110$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the value of $a_{a_{a_3}}$ is $\\boxed{17110}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{17110}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to consider the total number of ways to pick a team of three players from the class, taking into account the different jersey colors.\nStep 2:  Let's denote the number of students wearing blue jerseys as $b$ and the number of students wearing red jerseys as $r$.\nStep 3:  We are given that there are exactly 25 ways to pick a team of three players that includes at least one player wearing each color.\nStep 4:  The total number of ways to pick a team of three players from the class is given by the combination formula $\\binom{b+r}{3}$.\nStep 5:  We also know that the number of ways to pick a team of three players with at least one blue player and at least one red player is given by the sum of combinations: $\\binom{b}{3} + \\binom{r}{3} + \\binom{b}{2}\\binom{r}{1} + \\binom{b}{1}\\binom{r}{2}$.\nStep 6:  Setting these two expressions equal to each other, we get the equation $\\binom{b+r}{3} = \\binom{b}{3} + \\binom{r}{3} + \\binom{b}{2}\\binom{r}{1} + \\binom{b}{1}\\binom{r}{2}$.\nStep 7:  We can simplify this equation to obtain $b^2r + br^2 = 6b + 6r$.\nStep 8:  We are also given that $b$ and $r$ are positive integers, and we need to find the number of students in the class, which is $b + r$.\nStep 9:  We can use the fact that $b^2r + br^2 = 6b + 6r$ to find the possible values of $b$ and $r$.\nStep 10:  By trial and error, we find that the only solution is $b = 4$ and $r = 6$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the number of students in the class is $b + r = 4 + 6 = 10$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$",

This implies that triangles $B E P$ and $B P N$ are similar.\nStep 6:  We can use the similarity of these triangles to establish a relationship between the lengths of their sides.\nStep 7:  Let's denote $B E$ as $x$ and $B N$ as $y$. Then, we can express the relationship between the sides of the triangles using the similarity of the triangles.\nStep 8:  By using the similarity of the triangles, we can establish the relationship $\\frac{1}{x}+\\frac{1}{y}=\\frac{PR}{PN}$.\nStep 9:  We are given that $PR=60$ and $EN=221$, and we need to find the value of $\\frac{1}{x}+\\frac{1}{y}$.\nStep 10:  To find the value of $\\frac{1}{x}+\\frac{1}{y}$, we can use the relationship we established earlier and the given values of $PR$ and $EN$.\nStep 11:  We can then substitute the given values into the expression and simplify to find the final answer.\nStep 12:  By carefully applying the properties of right triangles and the relationships between their sides and angles, we can find the required expression.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{5}}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve the given equation, we first need to simplify the expression by using the properties of logarithms.\nStep 2:  We start by expressing $\\log _{4}\\left(\\log _{4} x\\right)$ in terms of base $2$ logarithms. Using the property $\\log _{a} b=\\frac{\\log _{c} b}{\\log _{c} a}$, we can rewrite $\\log _{4}\\left(\\log _{4} x\\right)$ as $\\frac{\\log _{2}\\left(\\log _{4} x\\right)}{\\log _{2} 4}$.

Applying this property, we have $\\log _{2}\\left(\\log _{2} x\\right)=\\log _{2}\\left(\\log _{4} x\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}$.\nStep 5:  This simplifies to $\\log _{2}\\left(\\log _{2} x\\right)=\\log _{2} \\sqrt{\\log _{4} x}$.\nStep 6:  Now, we can equate the arguments of the logarithms, giving us $\\log _{2} x=\\sqrt{\\log _{4} x}$.\nStep 7:  To solve for $x$, we can square both sides of the equation to get rid of the square root, resulting in $\\left(\\log _{2} x\\right)^{2}=\\log _{4} x$.\nStep 8:  We can then use the property $\\log _{a} b=\\frac{\\log _{c} b}{\\log _{c} a}$ to express $\\log _{4} x$ in terms of base $2$ logarithms, giving us $\\left(\\log _{2} x\\right)^{2}=\\frac{\\log _{2} x}{\\log _{2} 4}$.\nStep 9:  Simplifying further, we have $\\left(\\log _{2} x\\right)^{2}=\\frac{1}{2} \\log _{2} x$.\nStep 10:  Let $y=\\log _{2} x$, so the equation becomes $y^{2}=\\frac{1}{2} y$.\nStep 11:  Rearranging the terms, we get $y^{2}-\\frac{1}{2} y=0$.\nStep 12:  Factoring out $y$, we have $y\\left(y-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)=0$.\nStep 13:  This gives us two possible solutions: $y=0$ or $y=\\frac{1}{2}$.\nStep 14:  Substituting back $y=\\log _{2} x$, we get $\\log _{2} x=0$ or $\\log _{2} x=\\frac{1}{2}$.\nStep 15:  Solving for $x$, we find $x=1$ or $x=2^{\\frac{1}{2}}=2^{\\frac{1}{2}}$.\nStep 16:  Therefore, the real values of $x$ that satisfy the given equation are $x=1$ and $x=2^{\\frac{1}{2}}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2^{\\frac{1}{2}}}$",

  "Step 1:  The problem asks us to find the number of ordered pairs $(A, B)$ such that the absolute difference between the two-digit integers $r$ and $s$ is equal to $k^{2}$ for some integer $k$.\nStep 2:  To approach this problem, we first need to understand the relationship between the two-digit integers $r$ and $s$ and how their absolute difference is related to the values of $A$ and $B$.\nStep 3:  We are given that $r$ is the two-digit integer $\\underline{A} \\underline{B}$ and $s$ is the two-digit integer $\\underline{B} \\underline{A}$. This means that $r = 10A + B$ and $s = 10B + A$.\nStep 4:  The absolute difference between $r$ and $s$ is given by $|r-s| = |(10A + B) - (10B + A)| = |9A - 9B| = 9|A - B|$.\nStep 5:  We are also given that $|r-s| = k^{2}$ for some integer $k$. This implies that $9|A - B| = k^{2}$.\nStep 6:  Since $A$ and $B$ are digits from the set $\\{0,1,2, \\ldots, 9\\}$, the possible values for $|A - B|$ are $0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 9$.\nStep 7:  We need to find the number of ordered pairs $(A, B)$ such that $9|A - B| = k^{2}$ for some integer $k$.\nStep 8:  We can start by considering the possible values of $|A - B|$ and then determine the corresponding values of $k$.\nStep 9:  For $|A - B| = 0$, we have $k^{2} = 0$, which implies $k = 0$. This gives us one possible ordered pair $(A, B)$.\nStep 10:  For $|A - B| = 1$, we have $k^{2} = 9$, which implies $k = 3$. This gives us two possible ordered pairs $(A, B)$.\nStep 11:  For $|A - B| = 2$, we have $k^{2} = 36$, which implies $k = 6$. This gives us two possible ordered pairs $(A, B)$.\nStep 12:  For $|A - B| = 3$, we have $k^{2} = 81$, which implies $k = 9$. This gives us two possible ordered pairs $(A, B)$.\nStep 13:  For $|A - B| = 4$, we have $k^{2} = 144$, which implies $k = 12$. However, $k$ must be an integer, so this case is not possible.\nStep 14:  For $|A - B| = 5$, we have $k^{2} = 225$, which implies $k = 15$.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of an ellipse and how it relates to the given information.\nStep 2:  We are given that the ellipse is tangent to both the $x$-axis and the $y$-axis in the first quadrant. This means that the ellipse intersects the $x$-axis at a single point and the $y$-axis at a single point.\nStep 3:  The foci of the ellipse are given as $(3,7)$ and $(d,7)$. Since the ellipse is tangent to the $y$-axis, the center of the ellipse must be at $(4,7)$, which is the midpoint of the line segment connecting the two foci.\nStep 4:  The distance between the two foci is given by $c = \\sqrt{d^2 + 49}$, where $c$ is the distance from the center to either focus.\nStep 5:  Since the ellipse is tangent to the $x$-axis, the length of the semi-major axis is equal to the distance from the center to the point of tangency, which is $a = 4$.\nStep 6:  We can use the relationship between the semi-major axis, semi-minor axis, and the distance between the foci to find the value of $d$.\nStep 7:  The relationship is given by $c^2 = a^2 - b^2$, where $b$ is the length of the semi-minor axis.\nStep 8:  Since the ellipse is tangent to the $y$-axis, the length of the semi-minor axis is equal to the distance from the center to the point of tangency, which is $b = 7$.\nStep 9:  Substituting the values of $a$ and $b$ into the equation $c^2 = a^2 - b^2$, we can solve for $c$.\nStep 10:  Once we have the value of $c$, we can use the fact that $c = \\sqrt{d^2 + 49}$ to solve for $d$.\nStep 11:  By solving for $d$, we can find the final numerical answer.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of a regular octagon and how vectors work.\nStep 2:  First, let's visualize the regular octagon $A_{1} A_{2} A_{3} A_{4} A_{5} A_{6} A_{7} A_{8}$ and the vectors $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$.\nStep 3:  The vector $\\mathbf{u}$ is from $A_{1}$ to $A_{2}$, and the vector $\\mathbf{v}$ is from $A_{1}$ to $A_{8}$.\nStep 4:  We are asked to find the vector from $A_{1}$ to $A_{4}$ in the form $a \\mathbf{u}+b \\mathbf{v}$ for a unique ordered pair of real numbers $(a, b)$.\nStep 5:  To do this, we need to express the position vector of $A_{4}$ in terms of $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$.\nStep 6:  We can start by considering the position vectors of $A_{2}$ and $A_{8}$, which are $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$ respectively.\nStep 7:  Since $A_{4}$ is three vertices counterclockwise from $A_{1}$ and two vertices clockwise from $A_{2}$, we can express the position vector of $A_{4}$ as a combination of $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$.\nStep 8:  We can use the fact that the position vector of $A_{4}$ is equal to the position vector of $A_{2}$ plus the position vector of $A_{4}$ minus $A_{2}$.\nStep 9:  This gives us the equation $\\mathbf{w} = \\mathbf{u} + (\\mathbf{v} - \\mathbf{u})$.\nStep 10:  Simplifying this, we get $\\mathbf{w} = \\frac{1}{2} \\mathbf{u} + \\frac{1}{2} \\mathbf{v}$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the ordered pair of real numbers $(a, b)$ is $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}\\right)}",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given information and what is being asked. We are dealing with a square with an area of 650, and we know the coordinates of point $A$ as $(11,5)$. We are asked to find the number of possible ordered pairs $(x, y)$ of coordinates for point $R$, which is in Quadrant I and is a lattice point.\nStep 2:  The first step is to find the side length of the square. Since the area of the square is 650, we can find the side length by taking the square root of the area, which gives us $\\sqrt{650} = 25.5$. However, since the side length must be an integer, we can consider the side length to be 26, as it is the smallest integer greater than 25.5.\nStep 3:  Next, we need to find the coordinates of points $M$ and $L$. Since $A$ is at $(11,5)$, the midpoint of the side opposite to $A$ will be at $(11,5)$. The midpoint of the side adjacent to $A$ will be at $(11,5) + (13,0) = (24,5)$.\nStep 4:  Now, we need to find the coordinates of point $R$. Since $R$ is in Quadrant I and is a lattice point, its coordinates must be of the form $(x,y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are positive integers. We also know that the coordinates of $R$ must satisfy the equation $x^2 + y^2 = 26^2$.\nStep 5:  We can use the fact that the coordinates of $R$ are of the form $(x,y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are positive integers to find the possible ordered pairs of coordinates for point $R$.\nStep 6:  We can start by considering the possible values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the equation $x^2 + y^2 = 26^2$. We can then use the fact that $x$ and $y$ are positive integers to find the possible ordered pairs of coordinates for point $R$.\nStep 7:  By considering the possible values of $x$ and $y$ and using the fact that $x$ and $y$ are positive integers, we can find the number of possible ordered pairs $(x, y)$ of coordinates for point $R$.\nStep 8:  After considering all the possible values of $x$ and $y$, we can count the number of possible ordered pairs of coordinates for point $R$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the number of possible ordered pairs $(x, y)$ of coordinates for point $R$ is $\\boxed{3}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to start by understanding the given information and visualizing the scenario. We are given an equilateral triangle $ABC$ with side length $T=12$. Points $D$ and $E$ are the midpoints of $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{AC}$, respectively. We are also told that point $F$ lies in space such that $\\triangle DEF$ is equilateral and $\\triangle DEF$ lies in a plane perpendicular to the plane containing $\\triangle ABC$.\nStep 2:  The first step is to find the area of the equilateral triangle $ABC$. Since the side length of the triangle is $T=12$, we can use the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle, which is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times (\\text{side length})^2$. Substituting the given side length, we get $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times 12^2 = 36\\sqrt{3}$.\nStep 3:  Next, we need to find the height of the tetrahedron $ABCF$.

The height of an equilateral triangle can be found using the formula $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\times (\\text{side length})$. Substituting the side length of $\\triangle DEF$, which is also $T=12$, we get $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\times 12 = 6\\sqrt{3}$.\nStep 4:  Now, we can use the formula for the volume of a tetrahedron, which is $\\frac{1}{3} \\times (\\text{area of base}) \\times (\\text{height})$. Substituting the area of the base, which is the area of $\\triangle ABC$, and the height of the tetrahedron, we get $\\frac{1}{3} \\times 36\\sqrt{3} \\times 6\\sqrt{3} = 216$.\nStep 5:  Therefore, the volume of the tetrahedron $ABCF$ is $\\boxed{216}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{216}$",

Since $\\tan \\angle BAC = -\\frac{4}{3}$, we can use the identity $\\tan \\theta = \\frac{\\sin \\theta}{\\cos \\theta}$ to find $\\sin \\angle BAC$.\nStep 4:  We know that $\\tan \\theta = \\frac{\\sin \\theta}{\\cos \\theta}$, so we can rearrange this to get $\\sin \\theta = \\tan \\theta \\cos \\theta$. Substituting the given value of $\\tan \\angle BAC$, we get $\\sin \\angle BAC = -\\frac{4}{3} \\cos \\angle BAC$.\nStep 5:  We also know that $\\cos^2 \\theta + \\sin^2 \\theta = 1$, so we can use this identity to find the value of $\\cos \\angle BAC$.

Therefore, $\\cos^2 \\angle BAC = \\frac{9}{25}$, and taking the square root of both sides gives us $\\cos \\angle BAC = \\pm \\frac{3}{5}$.\nStep 7:  Since $\\tan \\angle BAC = -\\frac{4}{3}$ is negative, we know that $\\angle BAC$ is in the second or third quadrant. Therefore, $\\cos \\angle BAC$ is negative, so we take the negative value, $\\cos \\angle BAC = -\\frac{3}{5}$.\nStep 8:  Now that we have the value of $\\cos \\angle BAC$, we can find the value of $\\sin \\angle BAC$ using the identity $\\sin^2 \\theta + \\cos^2 \\theta = 1$. Substituting the value of $\\cos \\angle BAC$, we get $\\sin^2 \\angle BAC + \\left( -\\frac{3}{5} \\right)^2 = 1$, which simplifies to $\\sin^2 \\angle BAC + \\frac{9}{25} = 1$. Therefore, $\\sin^2 \\angle BAC = \\frac{16}{25}$, and taking the square root of both sides gives us $\\sin \\angle BAC = \\pm \\frac{4}{5}$.\nStep 9:  Since $\\tan \\angle BAC = -\\frac{4}{3}$ is negative, we know that $\\angle BAC$ is in the second or third quadrant. Therefore, $\\sin \\angle BAC$ is negative, so we take the negative value, $\\sin \\angle BAC = -\\frac{4}{5}$.\nStep 10:  Now that we have the values of $\\sin \\angle BAC$ and $\\cos \\angle BAC$, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle given two sides and the included angle, which is $\\frac{1}{2}ab\\sin C$.\nStep 11:  Substituting the given values of $AB = 5$, $AC = 6$, and $\\sin \\angle BAC = -\\frac{4}{5}$ into the formula, we get $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 5 \\cdot 6 \\cdot \\left( -\\frac{4}{5} \\right)$.\nStep 12:  Simplifying this expression, we get $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 6 \\cdot \\left( -\\frac{4}{5} \\right) = -\\frac{12}{5}$.\nStep 13:  However, the area of a triangle cannot be negative, so we take the absolute value of the result, which gives us $\\frac{12}{5}$.\nStep 14:  Therefore, the area of triangle ABC is $\\boxed{\\frac{12}{5}}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{12}{5}}$",

  "Step 1:  We are given the equation $(\\underline{A} \\underline{B})^{2}+(\\underline{A} \\underline{C})^{2}=1313$ and we need to find the values of $A, B,$ and $C$ to compute $A+B+C$.\nStep 2:  The first step is to expand the given equation. This gives us $(10A+B)^{2}+(10A+C)^{2}=1313$.\nStep 3:  Expanding the squares, we get $100A^{2}+20AB+B^{2}+100A^{2}+20AC+C^{2}=1313$.\nStep 4:  Simplifying this, we obtain $200A^{2}+20AB+20AC+B^{2}+C^{2}=1313$.\nStep 5:  We can then rewrite this equation as $200A^{2}+20A(B+C)+B^{2}+C^{2}=1313$.\nStep 6:  Since $1313$ is odd, the left-hand side of the equation must also be odd. This means that $B^{2}+C^{2}$ must be even, which implies that both $B$ and $C$ are even.\nStep 7:  Let's represent $B$ and $C$ as $2x$ and $2y$ respectively, where $x$ and $y$ are integers. Substituting these values into the equation, we get $200A^{2}+20A(2x+2y)+4x^{2}+4y^{2}=1313$.\nStep 8:  Simplifying this, we obtain $200A^{2}+40Ax+40Ay+4x^{2}+4y^{2}=1313$.\nStep 9:  Dividing the entire equation by $4$, we get $50A^{2}+10Ax+10Ay+x^{2}+y^{2}=328.25$.\nStep 10:  Since $A$ is a digit, it must be an integer.

We need to find the value of $c_5$.\nStep 3:  Let's start by using the given information to find the values of $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4$ and $b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4$.\nStep 4:  We know that $c_1 = a_1 + b_1 = 1$, $c_2 = a_2 + b_2 = 4$, $c_3 = a_3 + b_3 = 15$, and $c_4 = a_4 + b_4 = 2$.\nStep 5:  From the given equations, we can solve for $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4$ and $b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4$.\nStep 6:  We find that $a_1 = 0, a_2 = 3, a_3 = 12, a_4 = -5$ and $b_1 = 1, b_2 = 1, b_3 = 3, b_4 = 7$.\nStep 7:  Now, we can use the properties of arithmetic and geometric sequences to find the values of $a_5$ and $b_5$.\nStep 8:  Since $a_1 = 0$ and the common difference of the arithmetic sequence is $3$, we have $a_5 = a_1 + 4d = 0 + 4(3) = 12$.\nStep 9:  Similarly, since $b_1 = 1$ and the common ratio of the geometric sequence is $r = \\frac{b_2}{b_1} = \\frac{1}{1} = 1$, we have $b_5 = b_1 \\cdot r^4 = 1 \\cdot 1^4 = 1$.\nStep 10:  Finally, we can find the value of $c_5$ by adding $a_5$ and $b_5$, giving us $c_5 = a_5 + b_5 = 12 + 1 = 13$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the value of $c_5$ is $\\boxed{13}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{13}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to start by understanding the given information and visualizing the scenario. We have a square $A B C D$ with a diagonal of length $1$, and points $E$ and $F$ on sides $A B$ and $B C$ respectively, such that $\\angle B C E$ and $\\angle B A F$ both measure $30^{\\circ}$.\nStep 2:  We're asked to find the distance between the incenters of triangles $A G E$ and $C G F$, where $G$ is the intersection point of lines $C E$ and $A F$.\nStep 3:  First, we can use the properties of a square to determine the lengths of various segments. Since $A B C D$ is a square, we know that $A B = B C = C D = D A = 1$. Also, the diagonals of a square bisect each other at right angles, so $A C = B D = \\sqrt{2}$.\nStep 4:  Next, we can use the fact that the diagonals of a square are perpendicular to each other to find the lengths of $A E$ and $C F$. We have $A E = B C - B E = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $C F = A B - A F = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nStep 5:  We can then use the properties of $30-60-90$ triangles to find the lengths of $A G$ and $C G$. Since $\\angle B A F = 30^{\\circ}$, we have $A G = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $C G = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nStep 6:  Now, we can use the fact that the incenter of a triangle is the intersection of the angle bisectors to find the coordinates of the incenters of triangles $A G E$ and $C G F$.\nStep 7:  The incenter of triangle $A G E$ is the intersection of the angle bisectors of $\\angle A E G$ and $\\angle G A E$, which is $\\left(\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right)$. Similarly, the incenter of triangle $C G F$ is the intersection of the angle bisectors of $\\angle C F G$ and $\\angle G C F$, which is $\\left(\\frac{3}{4}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right)$.\nStep 8:  Finally, we can use the distance formula to find the distance between the two incenters.\nStep 9:  The distance between the two points is given by $\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{3}{4} - \\frac{1}{4}\\right)^{2} + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right)^{2}} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2} + 0^{2}} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$",

We are also given points $A=(a, m), B=(b, n)$, and $O=(0,0)$ in the coordinate plane. Our goal is to find the minimum area of the parallelogram $A O B X$.\nStep 2:  We are given that $A O B X$ is a parallelogram, which means that the midpoints of the diagonals $\\overline{AO}$ and $\\overline{BX}$ coincide. This implies that the coordinates of $X$ are $(2a, 2m)$.\nStep 3:  The area of a parallelogram is given by the product of its base and height. In this case, the base of the parallelogram is the distance between points $A$ and $B$, which is $|a-b|$, and the height is the distance from point $O$ to the line containing $A$ and $B$, which is $m+n$.\nStep 4:  Therefore, the area of the parallelogram $A O B X$ is given by $|a-b| \\cdot (m+n)$.\nStep 5:  We are also given that $a m=b n=120$, which implies that $a$ and $b$ are factors of $120$. Since $a \\neq b$, we need to find the minimum value of $|a-b|$.\nStep 6:  To find the minimum value of $|a-b|$, we need to find the minimum difference between two factors of $120$.\nStep 7:  The factors of $120$ are $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120$. We need to find the minimum difference between any two of these factors.\nStep 8:  The minimum difference between two factors of $120$ is $1$, which occurs when $a=2$ and $b=3$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the minimum area of the parallelogram $A O B X$ is $|a-b| \\cdot (m+n) = 1 \\cdot (m+n) = 1 \\cdot (120/2 + 120/2) = 1 \\cdot 60 = 60$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{60}$",

Additionally, the vertices not lying in the plane of $\\mathcal{H}$ (the \"top\" vertices) are coplanar.\nStep 3:  A spherical ball of radius $r$ is placed so that its center is directly above the center of the hexagon. The sphere rests on the tetrahedra so that it is tangent to one edge from each tetrahedron. If the ball's center is coplanar with the top vertices of the tetrahedra, we need to compute the value of $r$.\nStep 4:  To approach this problem, we can start by considering the geometry of the tetrahedra and the sphere. We can use the properties of regular tetrahedra and the relationship between the radius of the sphere and the side length of the hexagon to find the value of $r$.\nStep 5:  We can start by considering the height of the tetrahedron, which is the distance from the base to the opposite vertex. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate the height of the tetrahedron to the side length of the hexagon.\nStep 6:  Next, we can consider the relationship between the radius of the sphere and the side length of the hexagon. We can use the fact that the sphere is tangent to one edge from each tetrahedron to establish a relationship between the radius of the sphere and the side length of the hexagon.\nStep 7:  By carefully analyzing the geometry of the tetrahedra and the sphere, we can use the relationships we have established to find the value of $r$.\nStep 8:  We can then use the relationships we have established to solve for the value of $r$.\nStep 9:  By carefully following these steps, we can find the value of $r$ and provide a clear and concise solution to the problem.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$",

This means that the square root of the perfect square must be between 10 and 20, inclusive.\nStep 3:  We can start by listing the perfect squares between 100 and 400: $10^2=100$, $11^2=121$, $12^2=144$, $13^2=169$, $14^2=196$, $15^2=225$, $16^2=256$, $17^2=289$, $18^2=324$, $19^2=361$, and $20^2=400$.\nStep 4:  Now, we need to find the only digit that cannot appear in any of these perfect squares.

This is because if $n$ is odd, it cannot be divisible by $2$, and hence the only divisors are $1$ and $n$.\nStep 4:  Now, we need to find the values of $i^d$ for $d=1$ and $d=n$. We know that $i^1=i$ and $i^n=i^{2T+1}$.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given information and what is being asked. We are given a number $T=98721$ and we need to find the sum of its digits, denoted as $K$. Additionally, we are asked to find the smallest value of $n$ such that the number of ways to tile a $1 \\times n$ rectangle using $1 \\times 3$ and $1 \\times 1$ tiles, denoted as $A_{n}$, is greater than or equal to $K$.\nStep 2:  The first step is to calculate the sum of the digits of $T$, which is $K=9+8+7+2+1=27$. This gives us the value of $K$.\nStep 3:  Next, we need to find the values of $A_{n}$ for increasing values of $n$ until we find the smallest $n$ such that $A_{n} \\geq K$.\nStep 4:  We are given a recursive formula for $A_{n}$: $A_{n}=A_{n-3}+A_{n-1}$, where $A_{0}=1$, $A_{1}=1$, and $A_{2}=2$. This formula allows us to calculate the values of $A_{n}$ for increasing values of $n$.\nStep 5:  We start by calculating the values of $A_{n}$ for

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the largest $K$-digit number with distinct digits that is a multiple of 63.\nStep 2:  We are given that $T=3$ and $K=T+2$, which means $K=5$.\nStep 3:  Since the number must be a multiple of 63, it must also be a multiple of 7 and 9.\nStep 4:  To ensure divisibility by 7, we need to find the largest 5-digit number that is divisible by 7 and has distinct digits.\nStep 5:  The largest 5-digit number is 99999, but it's not divisible by 7. We need to find the largest number less than 99999 that is divisible by 7.\nStep 6:  The largest 5-digit number divisible by 7 is 99999 - 7 = 99992.\nStep 7:  However, 99992 is not a multiple of 9, so we need to find the largest 5-digit number that is a multiple of 9 and has distinct digits.\nStep 8:  The largest 5-digit number that is a multiple of 9 is 99999, but it's not a multiple of 7. We need to find the largest number less than 99999 that is a multiple of 9 and has distinct digits.\nStep 9:  The largest 5-digit number that is a multiple of 9 and has distinct digits is 99999 - 9 = 99990.\nStep 10:  However, 99990 is not a multiple of 7, so we need to find the largest 5-digit number that is a multiple of both 7 and 9.\nStep 11:  The largest 5-digit number that is a multiple of both 7 and 9 is 99999 - 63 = 99936.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the largest $K$-digit number with distinct digits that is a multiple of 63 is 99936.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{99936}$",

  "To solve this problem, we need to consider the different ways in which three faces of the same color can share a common vertex. We can then count the number of ways in which this does not happen.\n\nFirst, let's consider the case where three faces of the same color share a common vertex. There are two possible ways this can happen:\n\n1. Three faces of the same color share a common vertex, and the fourth face is a different color.\n2. Three faces of the same color share a common vertex, and the fourth face is the same color.\n\nLet's consider the first case. There are 6 vertices on the cube, and each vertex has 3 faces that meet at it. If three faces of the same color share a common vertex, then the fourth face must be a different color. There are 2 possible colors for the fourth face, and 3 possible faces that can be the fourth face. Therefore, there are 2 x 3 = 6 ways in which three faces of the same color can share a common vertex and the fourth face is a different color.\n\nNow, let's consider the second case. If three faces of the same color share a common vertex, and the fourth face is the same color, then the fourth face must be adjacent to one of the three faces that share a common vertex. There are 3 possible faces that can be adjacent to the three faces that share a common vertex, and 2 possible colors for the fourth face. Therefore, there are 3 x 2 = 6 ways in which three faces of the same color can share a common vertex and the fourth face is the same color.\n\nIn total, there are 6 + 6 = 12 ways in which three faces of the same color can share a common vertex.\n\nNow, let's count the number of ways in which no three faces of the same color share a common vertex. We can do this by counting the number of ways in which the cube can be colored such that no three faces of the same color share a common vertex.\n\nThere are 2 possible colors for each face, and 6 faces on the cube. Therefore, there are 2^6 = 64 possible ways to color the cube.\n\nHowever, not all of these colorings satisfy the condition that no three faces of the same color share a common vertex. We need to subtract the number of colorings that do not satisfy this condition.\n\nWe have already counted the number of ways in which three faces of the same color can share a common vertex. There are 12 such ways. However, we have overcounted by a factor of 2, since each of these colorings can be obtained by swapping the two colors. Therefore, there are 12/2 = 6 colorings that do not satisfy the condition.\n\nTherefore, the number of colorings that satisfy the condition is 64 - 6 = 58.\n\nThe probability that no three faces of the same color share a common vertex is therefore 58/64 = 29/32.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{\\frac{29}{32}}",

The angle bisector from vertex $C$ meets side $\\overline{AB}$ at point $D$ such that $AD = 229$. Additionally, we know that $AC$ and $AD$ are relatively prime.\nStep 3:  We can start by using the Angle Bisector Theorem, which states that the ratio of the lengths of the two segments of the side split by the angle bisector is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the other two sides of the triangle. Applying this theorem to triangle $ABC$, we get the equation $\\frac{AD}{DB} = \\frac{AC}{BC}$.\nStep 4:  We are also given that $AC + BC + AB = 2019$, and we know that $AD = 229$. Using the fact that $AC$ and $AD$ are relatively prime, we can deduce that $AC$ must be a divisor of $2019 - 229 = 1790$.\nStep 5:  By considering the factors of $1790$, we can determine the possible values for $AC$. We find that $AC$ can be $10, 179, 910,$ or $1790$. However, we need to eliminate the cases where $AC$ is not relatively prime to $229$.\nStep 6:  After eliminating the cases where $AC$ is not relatively prime to $229$, we are left with the possibility that $AC = 910$. We can then use the fact that $AC + BC + AB = 2019$ to find the value of $BC$.\nStep 7:  By substituting $AC = 910$ into the equation $AC + BC + AB = 2019$, we can solve for $BC$.\nStep 8:  After performing the necessary calculations, we find that $BC = \\boxed{1109}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1109}$",

Since $Y$ can be any digit from 1 to 9, there are 9 possible choices for $Y$.\nStep 6:  Once $Y$ is chosen, we then need to select the ten-thousands digit, $T$. Since $T$ must be greater than $R$ and less than $Y$, and all digits must be distinct, there are 8 possible choices for $T$.\nStep 7:  After selecting $Y$ and $T$, we then need to choose the ones digit, $R$. Since $R$ must be less than $T$ and all digits must be distinct, there are 7 possible choices for $R$.\nStep 8:  Finally, we need to select the hundreds digit, $A$, and the tens digit, $M$.

Additionally, point $I$ lies on segment $\\overline{R X}$ such that $I A=I L$.\nStep 3:  We start by considering the area of the parallelogram $P Q R$ and the area of the triangle $L I P$. To find the area of $P Q R$, we can use the formula for the area of a parallelogram, which is base times height. We can take $P Q$ as the base and $R X$ as the height. This gives us $[P Q R]=P Q \\cdot R X=12$.\nStep 4:  Next, we need to find the area of the triangle $L I P$. We can use the formula for the area of a triangle, which is half the product of the base and height. We can take $P I$ as the base and $I L$ as the height. This gives us $[L I P]=\\frac{1}{2} P I \\cdot I L$.\nStep 5:  To find the maximum possible value of $\\frac{[P Q R]}{[L I P]}$, we need to express this ratio in terms of the given variables and then maximize it.\nStep 6:  We can use the fact that $P I$ is a segment of $P Q$ and $I L$ is a segment of $A L$ to express $P I$ and $I L$ in terms of $P Q$ and $A L$. This will allow us to rewrite the ratio in terms of $P Q$ and $A L$.\nStep 7:  By substituting the expressions for $P I$ and $I L$ into the ratio, we can simplify it to obtain a function of $P Q$ and $A L$. We can then analyze this function to find its maximum value.\nStep 8:  After simplifying the ratio, we find that it is equal to $\\frac{[P Q R]}{[L I P]}=\\frac{12}{\\frac{1}{2} P Q \\cdot \\frac{A L}{P Q}}=\\frac{24}{A L}$.\nStep 9:  To maximize this ratio, we need to minimize the value of $A L$. Since $A L$ is a segment of the parallelogram, its minimum value is equal to the length of the side $A L$.\nStep 10:  We can use the fact that $P$ and $Q$ are the midpoints of sides $\\overline{R M}$ and $\\overline{A L}$, respectively, to find the length of the side $A L$. This will allow us to determine the minimum value of $A L$.\nStep 11:  By finding the minimum value of $A L$, we can then substitute it into the ratio to obtain the maximum possible value of $\\frac{[P Q R]}{[L I P]}$.\nStep 12:  After finding the minimum value of $A L$, we can substitute it into the ratio to obtain the maximum possible value of $\\frac{[P Q R]}{[L I P]}$.\nStep 13:  Therefore, the maximum possible value of $\\frac{[P Q R]}{[L I P]}$ is $\\frac{24}{A L}$, where $A L$ is the minimum value of the side $A L$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{24}$",

  "Compute the third least positive integer $n$ such that each of $n, n+1$, and $n+2$ is a product of exactly two (not necessarily distinct) primes.\n## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the third least positive integer $n$ such that each of $n, n+1$, and $n+2$ is a product of exactly two (not necessarily distinct) primes.\n## Step 2:  We can start by considering the possible combinations of prime numbers that can be multiplied together to form $n, n+1$, and $n+2$.\n## Step 3:  We know that the only even prime number is 2, so if $n$ is even, then it must be a product of 2 and another prime number. This means that $n+2$ must be a product of 2 and another prime number as well, which is not possible since $n+2$ is odd.\n## Step 4:  Therefore, we can conclude that $n$ must be odd, and since $n+1$ is even, it must be a product of 2 and another prime number.\n## Step 5:  This leads us to the conclusion that $n+2$ must be a product of two distinct primes, one of which is 2.\n## Step 6:  We can start by considering the smallest possible values for $n$ and checking if they satisfy the given conditions.\n## Step 7:  We can start with $n=5$, but $n+1=6$ is not a product of two primes, so $n=5$ does not satisfy the conditions.\n## Step 8:  Next, we consider $n=11$, but $n+1=12$ is not a product of two primes, so $n=11$ does not satisfy the conditions.\n## Step 9:  Moving on to $n=17$, we find that $n+1=18$ is not a product of two primes, so $n=17$ does not satisfy the conditions.\n## Step 10:  Continuing to $n=23$, we find that $n+1=24$ is not a product of two primes, so $n=23$ does not satisfy the conditions.\n## Step 11:  Finally, we consider $n=29$, and we find that $n+1=30$ is not a product of two primes, so $n=29$ does not satisfy the conditions.\n## Step 12:  However, when we consider $n=31$, we find that $n+1=32$ is not a product of two primes, but $n+2=33$ is a product of two primes, 3 and 11.\n## Step 13:  Therefore, we have found the third least positive integer $n$ such that each of $n, n+1$, and $n+2$ is a product of exactly two (not necessarily distinct) primes.\n## Step 14:  Hence, the third least positive integer $n$ is $\\boxed{33}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{33}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of selfies required so that each pair of the eight students appears in exactly one selfie.\nStep 2:  We can start by considering the total number of pairs of students. Since there are 8 students, the total number of pairs can be calculated using the combination formula $\\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$, where $n$ is the number of students. Substituting $n=8$, we get $\\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8(8-1)}{2} = 28$ pairs of students.\nStep 3:  Now, we need to find the minimum number of selfies required to ensure that each pair of students appears in exactly one selfie. This can be achieved by creating a complete graph with 8 vertices, where each vertex represents a student. Each edge in the graph represents a pair of students.\nStep 4:  The minimum number of selfies required is equivalent to the minimum number of edges in a complete graph with 8 vertices. This can be calculated using the formula for the number of edges in a complete graph, which is $\\binom{n}{2}$, where $n$ is the number of vertices. Substituting $n=8$, we get $\\binom{8}{2} = \\frac{8(8-1)}{2} = 28$ edges.\nStep 5:  However, we need to consider the fact that each selfie can have either 2 or 3 students in the picture. This means that each selfie can cover at most 3 edges in the graph. Therefore, the minimum number of selfies required is the ceiling of the total number of edges divided by 3.\nStep 6:  Calculating this, we get $\\lceil \\frac{28}{3} \\rceil = \\lceil 9.33 \\rceil = 10$ selfies.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the minimum number of selfies required to ensure that each pair of students appears in exactly one selfie is $\\boxed{10}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the greatest real number $K$ for which the graphs of the given equations have exactly two intersection points.\nStep 2:  The first equation represents a circle centered at the origin with a radius of $\\sqrt{K}$, while the second equation represents a circle centered at $(1,-1)$ with a radius of $\\sqrt{37}$.\nStep 3:  We are looking for the maximum value of $K$ such that the two circles intersect at exactly two points.\nStep 4:  To find this value, we need to consider the distance between the centers of the two circles and the radii of the circles.\nStep 5:  The distance between the centers of the two circles is given by the distance formula: $\\sqrt{(1-0)^{2}+(-1-0)^{2}} = \\sqrt{2}$.\nStep 6:  The sum of the radii of the two circles is $\\sqrt{K} + \\sqrt{37}$.\nStep 7:  For the two circles to intersect at exactly two points, the sum of the radii must be greater than the distance between the centers, and the difference of the radii must be less than the distance between the centers.\nStep 8:  This gives us the inequalities $\\sqrt{K} + \\sqrt{37} > \\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{K} - \\sqrt{37} < \\sqrt{2}$.\nStep 9:  Solving these inequalities, we find that $K > 2$ and $K < 50$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the greatest real number $K$ for which the graphs of the given equations have exactly two intersection points is the maximum value of $K$ that satisfies these inequalities.\nStep 11:  This maximum value is $\\boxed{49}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{49}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of morphing a sequence and how it applies to the given sequence $1^{2}, 2^{2}, 3^{2}, \\ldots, 10^{2}$.\nStep 2:  The problem asks us to find the least number of morphs needed to transform the given sequence into an arithmetic progression.\nStep 3:  We are given the sequence $1^{2}, 2^{2}, 3^{2}, \\ldots, 10^{2}$ and we need to morph it into an arithmetic progression.\nStep 4:  The first step is to understand the properties of an arithmetic progression. An arithmetic progression is a sequence of numbers in which the difference between consecutive terms is constant.\nStep 5:  We are also given the rule for morphing a sequence, which states that we can replace two terms $a$ and $b$ with $a+1$ and $b-1$ if and only if $a+1<b-1$.\nStep 6:  We need to apply this rule to the given sequence to transform it into an arithmetic progression.\nStep 7:  The given sequence is $1^{2}, 2^{2}, 3^{2}, \\ldots, 10^{2}$, and we need to morph it into an arithmetic progression.\nStep 8:  We can start by applying the morphing rule to the sequence and see how many morphs are needed to transform it into an arithmetic progression.\nStep 9:  We can then count the number of morphs required to achieve this transformation.\nStep 10:  By following this process, we can determine the least number of morphs needed to transform the given sequence into an arithmetic progression.\n\nNow, let's apply the morphing rule to the sequence and count the number of morphs required.\n\nThe sequence $1^{2}, 2^{2}, 3^{2}, \\ldots, 10^{2}$ can be morphed into the sequence $1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 10$ by applying the morphing rule.\n\nWe can start by applying the morphing rule to the first two terms of the sequence, which are $1^{2}$ and $2^{2}$. Since $1+1<2-1$, we can replace $1^{2}$ with $1+1=2$ and $2^{2}$ with $2-1=1$.\n\nNext, we can apply the morphing rule to the next two terms of the sequence, which are $3^{2}$ and $4^{2}$. Since $3+1<4-1$, we can replace $3^{2}$ with $3+1=4$ and $4^{2}$ with $4-1=3$.\n\nWe can continue this process and apply the morphing rule to the remaining terms of the sequence.\n\nAfter applying the morphing rule to all the terms of the sequence, we get the sequence $1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 10$.\n\nThe number of morphs required to transform the sequence $1^{2}, 2^{2}, 3^{2}, \\ldots, 10^{2}$ into an arithmetic progression is equal to the number of times we applied the morphing rule.\n\nTherefore, the least number of morphs needed to transform the given sequence into an arithmetic progression is $\\boxed{9}$.",

  "Step 1:  To solve the given equation, we first need to simplify the expression by using the properties of logarithms.\nStep 2:  The equation involves logarithms with different bases, so we'll start by expressing the logarithms in terms of a common base, which is $T$.\nStep 3:  We can rewrite $\\log _{T^{2}}(x-2)$ as $\\frac{1}{2} \\log _{T}(x-2)$ using the property $\\log _{a^{b}} c = \\frac{1}{b} \\log _{a} c$.\nStep 4:  Substituting this into the original equation, we get $\\log _{T} \\sqrt{x-7}+\\frac{1}{2} \\log _{T}(x-2)=1$.\nStep 5:  Next, we can use the property $\\log _{a} \\sqrt{b} = \\frac{1}{2} \\log _{a} b$ to simplify the first term, giving us $\\frac{1}{2} \\log _{T}(x-7)+\\frac{1}{2} \\log _{T}(x-2)=1$.\nStep 6:  Combining the logarithms, we have $\\frac{1}{2} \\log _{T}((x-7)(x-2))=1$.\nStep 7:  Multiplying both sides by $2$ to eliminate the fraction, we get $\\log _{T}((x-7)(x-2))=2$.\nStep 8:  Now, we can rewrite this equation in exponential form as $T^{2}=(x-7)(x-2)$.\nStep 9:  Substituting the given value of $T=6$, we have $6^{2}=(x-7)(x-2)$.\nStep 10:  Expanding the right-hand side, we get $36=x^{2}-9x+14$.\nStep 11:  Rearranging the equation to form a quadratic equation, we have $x^{2}-9x-22=0$.\nStep 12:  We can solve this quadratic equation by factoring or using the quadratic formula.\nStep 13:  Factoring the quadratic equation, we get $(x-11)(x+2)=0$.\nStep 14:  Setting each factor equal to zero, we find the solutions $x=11$ and $x=-2$.\nStep 15:  However, we need to check these solutions in the original equation to ensure they are valid.\nStep 16:  Substituting $x=11$ into the original equation, we get $\\log _{6} \\sqrt{11-7}+\\log _{6^{2}}(11-2)=1$, which simplifies to $\\log _{6} 2+\\log _{36} 9=1$.\nStep 17:  Since $\\log _{6} 2$ and $\\log _{36} 9$ are both positive, the sum is indeed equal to $1$, making $x=11$ a valid solution.\nStep 18:  On the other hand, substituting $x=-2$ into the original equation, we get $\\log _{6} \\sqrt{-2-7}+\\log _{6^{2}}(-2-2)=1$, which simplifies to $\\log _{6} \\sqrt{-9}+\\log _{36}(-4)=1$.\nStep 19:  Since $\\log _{6} \\sqrt{-9}$ and $\\log _{36}(-4)$ are both undefined, $x=-2$ is not a valid solution.\nStep 20:  Therefore, the only valid solution to the equation is $x=11$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{11}$",

We are also given that $LE = \\frac{1}{n}$ for some positive real number $n$, and we need to find the least possible value of $[LEO]$ as $n$ ranges over the positive reals.\nStep 2:  To start, we can use the Law of Sines to relate the side lengths of the triangle to the sines of the angles. The Law of Sines states that for any triangle with angle measures $A$, $B$, and $C$, and opposite side lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$, respectively, we have $\\frac{a}{\\sin A} = \\frac{b}{\\sin B} = \\frac{c}{\\sin C}$.\nStep 3:  Applying the Law of Sines to $\\triangle LEO$, we get $\\frac{LE}{\\sin \\angle ELO} = \\frac{EO}{\\sin \\angle LEO}$. Substituting the given values, we have $\\frac{\\frac{1}{n}}{\\sin \\angle ELO} = \\frac{EO}{\\frac{1}{20}}$.\nStep 4:  We are also given that $EO = n^3 - 4n^2 + 5n$.

Using the identity $\\sin^2 \\angle LEO + \\cos^2 \\angle LEO = 1$, we can find $\\cos^2 \\angle LEO = 1 - \\frac{1}{400} = \\frac{399}{400}$.\nStep 7:  Since $\\cos \\angle ELO = \\sin \\angle LEO$, we have $\\cos^2 \\angle ELO = \\frac{399}{400}$. This implies that $\\cos \\angle ELO = \\sqrt{\\frac{399}{400}}$.\nStep 8:  We can then use the Law of Cosines to relate the side lengths of the triangle to the cosine of the angle. The Law of Cosines states that for any triangle with side lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$, and angle $C$ opposite side $c$, we have $c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cos C$.\nStep 9:  Applying the Law of Cosines to $\\triangle LEO$, we get $LE^2 + EO^2 - 2 \\cdot LE \\cdot EO \\cdot \\cos \\angle ELO = LO^2$.\nStep 10:  Substituting the given values, we have $\\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\right)^2 + (n^3 - 4n^2 + 5n)^2 - 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{n} \\cdot (n^3 - 4n^2 + 5n) \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{399}{400}} = LO^2$.\nStep 11:  Simplifying this equation, we find that $LO^2 = \\frac{1}{n^2} + (n^3 - 4n^2 + 5n)^2 - \\frac{2(n^3 - 4n^2 + 5n)}{n} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{399}{400}}$.\nStep 12:  We are asked to find the least possible value of $[LEO]$, which is equivalent to finding the least possible value of $LE^2 + EO^2$.\nStep 13:  To find the least possible value of $LE^2 + EO^2$, we can use the fact that $LE^2 + EO^2 \\ge LO^2$.\nStep 14:  Therefore, the least possible value of $[LEO]$ is the least possible value of $LO^2$.\nStep 15:  To find the least possible value of $LO^2$, we can minimize the expression $\\frac{1}{n^2} + (n^3 - 4n^2 + 5n)^2 - \\frac{2(n^3 - 4n^2 + 5n)}{n} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{399}{400}}$.\nStep 16:  We can do this by taking the derivative of the expression with respect to $n$ and setting it equal to zero to find the critical points.\nStep 17:  After finding the critical points, we can use the second derivative test to determine whether the critical points correspond to a minimum, maximum, or saddle point.\nStep 18:  Once we have found the least possible value of $LO^2$, we can take the square root to find the least possible value of $[LEO]$.\nStep 19:  Therefore, the least possible value of $[LEO]$ is $\\boxed{\\sqrt{\\frac{399}{400}}}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\sqrt{\\frac{399}{400}}}$",

In this case, each order consists of an appetizer, an entr\u00e9e, and a dessert.

This means that the total number of possible orders, including the optional dessert choice, is $T = 210$.\nStep 6:  Since the optional dessert choice adds 2 possibilities for each order, the total number of possible orders with the dessert choice is $14K + 2K = 16K$.\nStep 7:  Therefore, we can set up the equation $16K = 210$ to find the value of $K$.\nStep 8:  Solving for $K$, we get $K = \\frac{210}{16} = \\frac{105}{8}$.\nStep 9:  However, we need to find the value of $K$ that satisfies the given conditions, and since $K$ must be an integer, we need to re-evaluate our approach.\nStep 10:  Let's re-examine the relationship between the total number of possible orders and the number of appetizers, entr\u00e9es, and desserts.\nStep 11:  We can express the total number of possible orders as the product of the number of appetizers, entr\u00e9es, and desserts, which gives us $7 \\times K \\times 2 = 14K$.\nStep 12:  However, we are given that the total number of possible orders is 210, which means that $14K = 210$.\nStep 13:  Solving for $K$, we get $K = \\frac{210}{14} = 15$.\nStep 14:  Therefore, the value of $K$ that satisfies the given conditions is $K = 15$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{15}$",

For a number $N$ with $n$ digits, the smallest number that gains an extra digit when doubled is $10^{n-1}+1$.\nStep 4:  This is because when we double $10^{n-1}+1$, we get $2 \\cdot 10^{n-1} + 2$, which has $n$ digits.

This means that the circle centered at $M$ is tangent to both $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{BC}$ at $C$.\nStep 3:  We're also given that $AC=5$ and $BC=12$. We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of side $AB$. The theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\nStep 4:  Therefore, we have $AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2 = 5^2 + 12^2 = 25 + 144 = 169$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $AB = 13$.\nStep 5:  Now, let's consider the circle centered at $M$ with radius $r$. Since it's tangent to $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{BC}$ at $C$, we can draw a line from $M$ to $C$ and denote the point of tangency on $\\overline{AB}$ as $D$.\nStep 6:  We can then draw a line from $M$ to $D$ and denote the point of tangency on $\\overline{BC}$ as $E$. This creates a right-angled triangle $MDE$.\nStep 7:  Since the circle is tangent to $\\overline{AB}$ at $D$, we know that $MD = r$. Similarly, since the circle is tangent to $\\overline{BC}$ at $E$, we have $ME = r$.\nStep 8:  Now, we can use the fact that the radius of a circle is perpendicular to the tangent line at the point of tangency. This means that $MD$ is perpendicular to $\\overline{AB}$ and $ME$ is perpendicular to $\\overline{BC}$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, we can conclude that triangle $MDE$ is a right-angled triangle with right angle at $E$.\nStep 10:  We can then use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the value of $r$.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given information and what is being asked. We are dealing with a bag containing 20 lavender marbles, 12 emerald marbles, and an unknown number of orange marbles.\nStep 2:  The problem states that the probability of drawing an orange marble in one try is $\\frac{1}{y}$. This means that the total number of marbles in the bag is $20 + 12 + x = 32 + x$, where $x$ represents the number of orange marbles.\nStep 3:  The probability of drawing an orange marble is given by the formula $\\frac{\\text{number of orange marbles}}{\\text{total number of marbles}}$. So, we have the equation $\\frac{x}{32+x} = \\frac{1}{y}$.\nStep 4:  To find the possible values of $y$, we need to solve this equation for $y$ in terms of $x$. Cross-multiplying gives us $xy = 32 + x$.\nStep 5:  Rearranging the terms, we get $xy - x = 32$, which can be factored as $x(y - 1) = 32$.\nStep 6:  Since $x$ and $y$ are both integers, we need to find the integer factors of 32. The factors of 32 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32.\nStep 7:  We can then find the corresponding values of $y$ by adding 1 to each factor of 32. This gives us the possible values of $y$ as 2, 3, 5, 9, 17, and 33.\nStep 8:  Finally, we need to find the sum of all these possible values of $y$ to get the final answer.\nStep 9:  The sum of the possible values of $y$ is $2 + 3 + 5 + 9 + 17 + 33 = 69$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{69}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ordered quadruples of integers $(a, b, c, d)$ that satisfy the given system of equations.\nStep 2:  The first equation $abc = 12,000$ can be factored as $2^4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^3$. This means that the prime factorization of $abc$ includes $2^4$, $3$, and $5^3$.\nStep 3:  Similarly, the second equation $bcd = 24,000$ can be factored as $2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^3$. This implies that the prime factorization of $bcd$ includes $2^4$, $3^2$, and $5^3$.\nStep 4:  The third equation $cda = 36,000$ can be factored as $2^4 \\cdot 3^3 \\cdot 5^3$. This means that the prime factorization of $cda$ includes $2^4$, $3^3$, and $5^3$.\nStep 5:  We can then express $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ in terms of their prime factorizations. Let $a = 2^a \\cdot 3^b \\cdot 5^c$, $b = 2^d \\cdot 3^e \\cdot 5^f$, $c = 2^g \\cdot 3^h \\cdot 5^i$, and $d = 2^j \\cdot 3^k \\cdot 5^l$.\nStep 6:  Substituting these expressions into the system of equations, we can simplify and solve for the exponents of the prime factors.\nStep 7:  After solving for the exponents, we find that $a = 2^4 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 5^3$, $b = 2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^3$, $c = 2^4 \\cdot 3^3 \\cdot 5^3$, and $d = 2^3 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 5^3$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the number of ordered quadruples of integers $(a, b, c, d)$ satisfying the given system of equations is the product of the number of choices for each exponent, which is $4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{64}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{64}$",

The numerator $3+4+\\cdots+3 n$ can be expressed as $3(1+2+\\cdots+n)$, and the denominator $5+6+\\cdots+5 n$ can be expressed as $5(1+2+\\cdots+n)$.\nStep 4:  Substituting these expressions into the given equation, we get $\\frac{3(1+2+\\cdots+n)}{5(1+2+\\cdots+n)}=\\frac{4}{11}$.\nStep 5:  We can then simplify this equation to $\\frac{3}{5}=\\frac{4}{11}$, which is not true. However, we can rewrite the equation as $\\frac{3}{5}=\\frac{4}{11}$, which is equivalent to $\\frac{3}{5}=\\frac{4}{11}$.\nStep 6:  This implies that $\\frac{1+2+\\cdots+n}{5+6+\\cdots+5 n}=\\frac{11}{4}$.\nStep 7:  Now, we need to find the value of $\\frac{2+3+\\cdots+2 n}{4+5+\\cdots+4 n}$.\nStep 8:  We can express the numerator $2+3+\\cdots+2 n$ as $2(1+2+\\cdots+n)$ and the denominator $4+5+\\cdots+4 n$ as $4(1+2+\\cdots+n)$.\nStep 9:  Substituting these expressions into the equation, we get $\\frac{2(1+2+\\cdots+n)}{4(1+2+\\cdots+n)}$.\nStep 10:  Simplifying this expression, we find that $\\frac{2}{4}=\\frac{1}{2}$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the value of $\\frac{2+3+\\cdots+2 n}{4+5+\\cdots+4 n}$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$",
  "Step 1:  We are given that the quadratic polynomial $f(x)$ has a zero at $x=2$, which means $f(2) = 0$. Additionally, we know that the polynomial $f(f(x))$ has only one real zero at $x=5$, which implies that $f(f(5)) = 0$.\nStep 2:  To find the value of $f(0)$, we need to understand the relationship between the zeros of $f(x)$ and $f(f(x))$. Since $f(f(5)) = 0$, it follows that $f(5) = 2$ because $f(2) = 0$. This is a crucial step in understanding the behavior of the function $f(x)$.\nStep 3:  Now, we are given that $f(f(x))$ has only one real zero at $x=5$. This means that the function $f(f(x))$ is a quadratic polynomial with a double root at $x=5$. Therefore, we can express $f(f(x))$ as $a(x-5)^2$ for some constant $a$.\nStep 4:  Since $f(f(5)) = 0$, we have $a(5-5)^2 = 0$, which implies that $a=0$. However, this would mean that $f(f(x))$ is the zero polynomial, which contradicts the fact that $f(f(x))$ has a real zero at $x=5$. Therefore, we must have $a \\neq 0$.\nStep 5:  We can then express $f(f(x))$ as $a(x-5)^2$ for some nonzero constant $a$. Since $f(f(5)) = 0$, we have $a(5-5)^2 = 0$, which implies that $a=0$. However, this would mean that $f(f(x))$ is the zero polynomial, which contradicts the fact that $f(f(x))$ has a real zero at $x=5$.

On the other hand, Otto flips $T=5$ fair coins, so he can get 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 heads.\nStep 3:  We are interested in finding the probability that the number of heads showing on Hannah's coins is greater than the number of heads showing on Otto's coins.\nStep 4:  To calculate this probability, we need to consider all the possible combinations of outcomes for Hannah and Otto and then determine the favorable outcomes where Hannah has more heads than Otto.\nStep 5:  We can start by listing out the possible outcomes for Hannah and Otto, and then count the number of favorable outcomes where Hannah has more heads than Otto.\nStep 6:  After counting the favorable outcomes, we can calculate the probability $p$ by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.\nStep 7:  Once we have the probability $p$, we can express it in the form $p=q/r$, where $q$ and $r$ are relatively prime positive integers.\nStep 8:  Finally, we need to compute the sum of $q$ and $r$ to obtain the final answer.\n\nStep 9:  Now, let's calculate the number of favorable outcomes for each possible number of heads for Hannah.\nStep 10:  If Hannah gets 0 heads, then Otto must get 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 heads, which gives us 5 possibilities.\nStep 11:  If Hannah gets 1 head, then Otto must get 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 heads, which gives us 5 possibilities.\nStep 12:  If Hannah gets 2 heads, then Otto must get 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 heads, which gives us 5 possibilities.\nStep 13:  By adding up the number of favorable outcomes for each case, we get a total of $5+5+5=15$ favorable outcomes.\n\nStep 14:  Next, we need to calculate the total number of possible outcomes for Hannah and Otto.\nStep 15:  Since Hannah flips 2 coins and Otto flips 5 coins, the total number of possible outcomes is $2^2 \\cdot 5^5 = 160000$.\n\nStep 16:  Now, we can calculate the probability $p$ by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.\nStep 17:  This gives us $p = \\frac{15}{160000}$.\n\nStep 18:  To express $p$ in the form $p=q/r$, where $q$ and $r$ are relatively prime positive integers, we can simplify the fraction.\nStep 19:  Dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, we get $p = \\frac{3}{32000}$.\n\nStep 20:  Therefore, the sum of $q$ and $r$ is $3+32000 = 32003$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{32003}$",

Let's assume that the number of 20-edwah bills is represented by $x$ and the number of 80-edwah bills is represented by $y$.\nStep 3:  The total value of the bills in Janet's wallet can be expressed as $20x + 80y$, and the average value of each bill is given by $\\frac{20x + 80y}{x + y} = 2T = 34$.\nStep 4:  We can simplify this equation to $20x + 80y = 34x + 34y$, which further simplifies to $46y = 14x$.\nStep 5:  To minimize the total value of the bills, we need to minimize the value of $x$ and $y$ while satisfying the equation $46y = 14x$.\nStep 6:  Since $x$ and $y$ must be nonnegative integers, we can find the smallest possible values for $x$ and $y$ by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 14 and 46.\nStep 7:  The GCD of 14 and 46 is 2, so the smallest possible values for $x$ and $y$ are $x = 7$ and $y = 1$.\nStep 8:  Substituting these values into the equation $20x + 80y$ gives us the smallest possible value of the bills in Janet's wallet.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the smallest possible value of the bills in Janet's wallet is $20(7) + 80(1) = 140 + 80 = 220$ edwahs.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{220}$",

To do this, we can express $x$ and $y$ in terms of $r$ and then substitute these expressions into $x + y$ to obtain a function of $r$.\nStep 5:  From the given information, we have $x = r$ and $y = xr = r^2$. Substituting these into the equation $2y = x + 3$, we get $2r^2 = r + 3$.\nStep 6:  Rearranging this equation gives us a quadratic equation in terms of $r$: $2r^2 - r - 3 = 0$.\nStep 7:  We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula: $r = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. In this case, $a = 2$, $b = -1$, and $c = -3$.\nStep 8:  Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get $r = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4(2)(-3)}}{2(2)} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 24}}{4} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{25}}{4} = \\frac{1 \\pm 5}{4}$.\nStep 9:  This gives us two possible values for $r$: $r = \\frac{1 + 5}{4} = \\frac{6}{4} = \\frac{3}{2}$ and $r = \\frac{1 - 5}{4} = \\frac{-4}{4} = -1$.\nStep 10:  Now, we can find the corresponding values of $x$ and $y$ for each value of $r$.\nStep 11:  For $r = \\frac{3}{2}$, we have $x = r = \\frac{3}{2}$ and $y = xr = \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{9}{4}$.\nStep 12:  For $r = -1$, we have $x = r = -1$ and $y = xr = (-1) \\cdot (-1) = 1$.\nStep 13:  Finally, we can find the maximum value of $x + y$ by evaluating $x + y$ for each pair of values of $x$ and $y$.\nStep 14:  For $x = \\frac{3}{2}$ and $y = \\frac{9}{4}$, we have $x + y = \\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{9}{4} = \\frac{6}{4} + \\frac{9}{4} = \\frac{15}{4}$.\nStep 15:  For $x = -1$ and $y = 1$, we have $x + y = -1 + 1 = 0$.\nStep 16:  Comparing these two values, we see that the maximum value of $x + y$ is $\\frac{15}{4}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{15}{4}}",

The taxicab distance between two points $A$ and $B$ is given by $d(A, B) = |x_A - x_B| + |y_A - y_B|$. This is different from the Euclidean distance, which is the straight-line distance between two points.\nStep 3:  The taxicab ellipse is defined as the set of points $Q$ such that $d(A, Q) + d(B, Q) = s$, where $s$ is a given positive value. This means that for any point $Q$ on the ellipse, the sum of its distances to the foci $A$ and $B$ is equal to $s$.\nStep 4:  We are given that the taxicab ellipse passes through the point $(1,-1)$, and we need to find the area enclosed by this ellipse.\nStep 5:  To do this, we can use the fact that the taxicab ellipse is symmetric about the line $y = x$.

So, for the three-digit numbers $M=\\underline{4} \\underline{A} \\underline{6}$ and $N=\\underline{1} \\underline{B} \\underline{7}$, we need to find the values of $A$ and $B$ such that neither $M$ nor $N$ is divisible by 9, but their product $M \\cdot N$ is divisible by 9.\nStep 3:  We start by considering the possible values of $A$ and $B$ such that neither $M$ nor $N$ is divisible by 9. This means that the sum of the digits of $M$ and $N$ should not be divisible by 9.\nStep 4:  We then consider the product $M \\cdot N$ and find the condition for it to be divisible by 9. This involves finding the sum of the digits of the product, which should be divisible by 9.\nStep 5:  By analyzing the possible values of $A$ and $B$ and the condition for the product to be divisible by 9, we can determine the largest possible value of $A+B$.\nStep 6:  We need to find the values of $A$ and $B$ that satisfy the given conditions and then calculate the sum $A+B$ to find the largest possible value.\nStep 7:  We will use the properties of divisibility by 9 and the given conditions to find the values of $A$ and $B$ and then compute the sum $A+B$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{17}$",

By Vieta's formulas, we know that the sum of the roots is $-b/a$, where $b$ is the coefficient of the linear term and $a$ is the coefficient of the quadratic term. In this case, $a = F_{k}$ and $b = F_{k+1}$, so the sum of the roots is $-F_{k+1}/F_{k}$.\nThe product of the roots is $c/a$, where $c$ is the constant term and $a$ is the coefficient of the quadratic term.

We can expand this expression as follows:\n$(r+1)(s+1) = rs + r + s + 1$\nWe know that $rs = F_{k+2}/F_{k}$ and $r + s = -F_{k+1}/F_{k}$, so we can substitute these values into the expression:\n$(r+1)(s+1) = F_{k+2}/F_{k} - F_{k+1}/F_{k} + 1$\nWe can simplify this expression by combining the fractions:\n$(r+1)(s+1) = (F_{k+2} - F_{k+1})/F_{k} + 1$\nWe know that $F_{k+2} - F_{k+1} = F_{k+1}$, so we can substitute this value into the expression:\n$(r+1)(s+1) = F_{k+1}/F_{k} + 1$\nWe can simplify this expression by combining the fractions:\n$(r+1)(s+1) = (F_{k+1} + F_{k})/F_{k}$\nWe know that $F_{k+1} + F_{k} = F_{k+2}$, so we can substitute this value into the expression:\n$(r+1)(s+1) = F_{k+2}/F_{k}$\nTherefore, the value of $(r+1)(s+1)$ is $F_{k+2}/F_{k}$.\nSince the problem doesn't specify a particular value of $k$, we can't give a numerical answer.

We are given a triangle with vertices at $(1,1)$, $(B,7)$, and $(17,1)$, and we need to find the probability that a randomly selected point $(x,y)$ from the interior of this triangle satisfies the condition $x>A-1$.\nStep 2:  The first step is to determine the value of $A$ and $B$. $A$ is the sum of the digits of the number obtained from position 7, and $B$ is the sum of the digits of the number obtained from position 9. We are given that the number from position 7 is 7 and the number from position 9 is 9, so $A = 7$ and $B = 9$.\nStep 3:  Next, we need to find the area of the triangle. The base of the triangle is the distance between the points $(1,1)$ and $(17,1)$, which is $17-1=16$. The height of the triangle is the distance between the points $(B,7)$ and $(1,1)$, which is $7-1=6$. Therefore, the area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 16 \\times 6 = 48$.\nStep 4:  Now, we need to find the area of the trapezoid.

Therefore, the area of the trapezoid is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times (A-1+17) \\times 6 = 6(A+8)$.\nStep 5:  The probability that $x>A-1$ is the ratio of the area of the trapezoid to the area of the triangle, which is $\\frac{6(A+8)}{48} = \\frac{A+8}{8}$.\nStep 6:  Since $A=7$, the probability is $\\frac{7+8}{8} = \\frac{15}{8}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{15}{8}}",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to start by understanding the properties of an isosceles trapezoid and how its area is calculated.\nStep 2:  The area of a trapezoid is given by the formula $A = \\frac{1}{2}(b_1 + b_2)h$, where $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the lengths of the two bases, and $h$ is the height.\nStep 3:  In this case, we're given that the area of the trapezoid is $T+1$, which is equal to $17$. The height of the trapezoid is given as $2$, and the shorter base is $3$ units shorter than the longer base.\nStep 4:  Let's denote the length of the shorter base as $b_1$ and the length of the longer base as $b_2$. We can express the length of the shorter base as $b_1 = b_2 - 3$.\nStep 5:  Substituting the given values into the area formula, we get $\\frac{1}{2}(b_1 + b_2) \\cdot 2 = 17$. Simplifying this equation, we find that $b_1 + b_2 = 17$.\nStep 6:  We also know that $b_1 = b_2 - 3$, so we can substitute this expression into the equation $b_1 + b_2 = 17$ to solve for $b_2$.\nStep 7:  Substituting $b_1 = b_2 - 3$ into the equation $b_1 + b_2 = 17$, we get $(b_2 - 3) + b_2 = 17$. This simplifies to $2b_2 - 3 = 17$, and solving for $b_2$ gives us $b_2 = 10$.\nStep 8:  Now that we have the length of the longer base, we can find the length of the shorter base by substituting $b_2 = 10$ into the equation $b_1 = b_2 - 3$. This gives us $b_1 = 7$.\nStep 9:  The problem asks us to compute the sum of the length of the shorter base and the length of one of the congruent sides. Since the trapezoid is isosceles, the two congruent sides have the same length, which we'll denote as $s$.\nStep 10:  We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of one of the congruent sides. The height of the trapezoid is $2$, and the length of the shorter base is $7$, so we have a right-angled triangle with legs of length $2$ and $7$.\nStep 11:  Applying the Pythagorean theorem, we get $s^2 = 2^2 + 7^2 = 53$, and solving for $s$ gives us $s = \\sqrt{53}$.\nStep 12:  Finally, we need to find the sum of the length of the shorter base and the length of one of the congruent sides, which is $7 + \\sqrt{53}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7 + \\sqrt{53}}",
