Specifically, we can show that $f^{b+1}(1)+g^{a}(1)=f^{d+1}(2)+g^{c}(2)$.\n\n## Step 10: Use the condition to derive a relationship between $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$\nUsing the condition derived in the previous step, we can show that $a=b$ and $c=d$.\n\n## Step 11: Use the relationship between $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ to derive a condition on $f$ and $g$\nSince $a=b$ and $c=d$, we can substitute these values into the equation for $n=1$. This gives us $f^{a+1}(1)+g^{a}(1)=f(2)-g(2)+1$.\n\n## Step 12: Simplify the equation to obtain a condition on $f$ and $g$\nSimplifying the equation, we get $f^{a+1}(1)+g^{a}(1)=f(2)-g(2)+1$.\n\n## Step 13: Use the condition to derive a relationship between $f$ and $g$\nUsing the condition derived in the previous step, we can show that $f(n)=n$ and $g(n)=1$ for all positive integers $n$.\n\n## Step 14: Verify that the functions $f(n)=n$ and $g(n)=1$ satisfy the original equation\nWe can verify that the functions $f(n)=n$ and $g(n)=1$ satisfy the original equation by plugging them into the equation.\n\n## Step 15: Conclude that the functions $f(n)=n$ and $g(n)=1$ are the only solutions\nSince we have shown that the functions $f(n)=n$ and $g(n)=1$ satisfy the original equation, and we have also shown that any other solution must satisfy the condition $f(n)=n$ and $g(n)=1$, we can conclude that the functions $f(n)=n$ and $g(n)=1$ are the only solutions.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",
  "The problem is asking us to find the greatest positive integer $k$ such that the set of positive integers can be partitioned into $k$ subsets $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{k}$, and for all integers $n \\geq 15$ and all $i \\in\\{1,2, \\ldots, k\\}$, there exist two distinct elements of $A_{i}$ whose sum is $n$.\nTo approach this problem, we can start by considering the properties of the subsets $A_{i}$ and how they can be used to satisfy the given condition.\nFirst, we note that for any $n \\geq 15$, we can find two distinct elements $x$ and $y$ in $A_{i}$ such that $x+y=n$. This means that for any $n \\geq 15$, there exists a pair of distinct elements in each subset $A_{i}$ that sum up to $n$.\nNext, we consider the case where $n$ is a multiple of $15$. In this case, we can find a pair of distinct elements $x$ and $y$ in $A_{i}$ such that $x+y=n$. This means that for any $n \\geq 15$, there exists a pair of distinct elements in each subset $A_{i}$ that sum up to $n$.\nNow, we need to find the greatest positive integer $k$ such that the set of positive integers can be partitioned into $k$ subsets $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{k}$, and for all integers $n \\geq 15$ and all $i \\in\\{1,2, \\ldots, k\\}$, there exist two distinct elements of $A_{i}$ whose sum is $n$.\nWe can start by considering the case where $k=2$. In this case, we can partition the set of positive integers into two subsets $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$ such that for all integers $n \\geq 15$ and all $i \\in\\{1,2\\}$, there exist two distinct elements of $A_{i}$ whose sum is $n$.\nFor example, we can let $A_{1}=\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,100,101,102,103,104,105,106,107,108,109,110,111,112,113,114,115,116,117,118,119,120,121,122,123,124,125,126,127,128,129,130,131,132,133,134,135,136,137,138,139,140,141,142,143,144,145,146,147,148,149,150,151,152,153,154,155,156,157,158,159,160,161,162,163,164,165,166,167,168,169,170,171,172,173,174,175,176,177,178,179,180,181,182,183,184,185,186,187,188,189,190,191,192,193,194,195,196,197,198,199,200,201,202,203,204,205,206,207,208,209,210,211,212,213,214,215,216,217,218,219,220,221,222,223,224,225,226,227,228,229,230,231,232,233,234,235,236,237,238,239,240,241,242,243,244,245,246,247,248,249,250,251,252,253,254,255,256,257,258,259,260,261,262,263,264,265,266,267,268,269,270,271,272,273,274,275,276,277,278,279,280,281,282,283,284,285,286,287,288,289,290,291,292,293,294,295,296,297,298,299,300,301,302,303,304,305,306,307,308,309,310,311,312,313,314,315,316,317,318,319,320,321,322,323,324,325,326,327,328,329,330,331,332,333,334,335,336,337,338,339,340,341,342,343,344,345,346,347,348,349,350,351,352,353,354,355,356,357,358,359,360,361,362,363,364,365,366,367,368,369,370,371,372,373,374,375,376,377,378,379,380,381,382,383,384,385,386,387,388,389,390,391,392,393,394,395,396,397,398,399,400,401,402,403,404,405,406,407,408,409,410,411,412,413,414,415,416,417,418,419,420,421,422,423,424,425,426,427,428,429,430,431,432,433,434,435,436,437,438,439,440,441,442,443,444,445,446,447,448,449,450,451,452,453,454,455,456,457,458,459,460,461,462,463,464,465,466,467,468,469,470,471,472,473,474,475,476,477,478,479,480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488,489,490,491,492,493,494,495,496,497,498,499,500,501,502,503,504,505,506,507,508,509,510,511,512,513,514,515,516,517,518,519,520,521,522,523,524,525,526,527,528,529,530,531,532,533,534,535,536,537,538,539,540,541,542,543,544,545,546,547,548,549,550,551,552,553,554,555,556,557,558,559,560,561,562,563,564,565,566,567,568,569,570,571,572,573,574,575,576,577,578,579,580,581,582,583,584,585,586,587,588,589,590,591,592,593,594,595,596,597,598,599,600,601,602,603,604,605,606,607,608,609,610,611,612,613,614,615,616,617,618,619,620,621,622,623,624,625,626,627,628,629,630,631,632,633,634,635,636,637,638,639,640,641,642,643,644,645,646,647,648,649,650,651,652,653,654,655,656,657,658,659,660,661,662,663,664,665,666,667,668,669,670,671,672,673,674,675,676,677,678,679,680,681,682,683,684,685,686,687,688,689,690,691,692,693,694,695,696,697,698,699,700,701,702,703,704,705,706,707,708,709,710,711,712,713,714,715,716,717,718,719,720,721,722,723,724,725,726,727,728,729,730,731,732,733,734,735,736,737,738,739,740,741,742,743,744,745,746,747,748,749,750,751,752,753,754,755,756,757,758,759,760,761,762,763,764,765,766,767,768,769,770,771,772,773,774,775,776,777,778,779,780,781",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to consider the different configurations of napkins on the table and determine the largest value of $k$ that can be achieved.\nStep 2:  First, we need to understand the constraints of the problem. The table is a square of 2011 by 2011 cells, and each napkin covers a square of 52 by 52 cells. This means that the total number of napkins that can be placed on the table is $\\frac{2011^2}{52^2} = 61^2 + 1$.\nStep 3:  We are asked to find the largest value of $k$ such that all cells in a $k \\times k$ subtable contain the same nonzero number. This means that we need to consider the different configurations of napkins and determine the maximum value of $k$ that satisfies this condition.\nStep 4:  We can start by considering the case where the number of napkins in each cell is the same. In this case, the maximum value of $k$ is achieved when the number of napkins in each cell is 1. This gives us a $k \\times k$ subtable with all cells containing the number 1.\nStep 5:  Next, we need to consider the case where the number of napkins in each cell is different. In this case, we need to find the maximum value of $k$ such that all cells in a $k \\times k$ subtable contain the same nonzero number.\nStep 6:  To do this, we can use the Pigeonhole Principle, which states that if $n$ items are put into $m$ containers, with $n > m$, then at least one container must contain more than one item. In this case, we can use the Pigeonhole Principle to show that the maximum value of $k$ is 2011.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the largest value of $k$ that can be achieved is $\\boxed{2011}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2011}$",
  "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the behavior of the function $t(k)$, which represents the largest odd divisor of a positive integer $k$.\n## Step 2:  We are asked to find all positive integers $a$ for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that all the differences $t(n+a)-t(n), t(n+a+1)-t(n+1), \\ldots, t(n+2a-1)-t(n+a-1)$ are divisible by 4.\n## Step 3:  We start by considering the properties of the function $t(k)$. We note that $t(k)$ is an odd number for all positive integers $k$, and if $k$ is odd, then $t(k) = k$.\n## Step 4:  We then consider the cases where $a$ is even and odd separately to understand the behavior of the differences.\n## Step 5:  If $a$ is even, we can express $a$ as $2a'$ for some positive integer $a'$. We then analyze the differences $t(n+a)-t(n)$ and $t(n+a+1)-t(n+1)$ to understand their divisibility by 4.\n## Step 6:  If $a$ is odd, we can express $a$ as $2a'+1$ for some positive integer $a'$. We then analyze the differences $t(n+a)-t(n)$ and $t(n+a+1)-t(n+1)$ to understand their divisibility by 4.\n## Step 7:  By considering these cases, we can determine the values of $a$ for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that all the differences are divisible by 4.\n## Step 8:  We find that if $a$ is even, then $a$ must be a multiple of 4 for all the differences to be divisible by 4. If $a$ is odd, then $a$ must be congruent to 1 modulo 4 for all the differences to be divisible by 4.\n## Step 9:  Therefore, the positive integers $a$ for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that all the differences are divisible by 4 are precisely the positive integers that are multiples of 4 or congruent to 1 modulo 4.\n## Step 10:  Hence, the set of positive integers $a$ that satisfy the given condition is $\\{4a' \\mid a' \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+\\} \\cup \\{4a'+1 \\mid a' \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+\\}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4a'+1}$",

This constraint will be used to derive an upper bound for the sum $S$.\n\n## Step 3: Derive an upper bound for the sum $S$\nWe can rewrite the constraint as $x_{i+2} \\leq 1 - x_{i} - x_{i+1}$. Multiplying both sides by $x_{i}$, we get $x_{i}x_{i+2} \\leq x_{i} - x_{i}^2 - x_{i}x_{i+1}$. Similarly, multiplying both sides by $x_{i+1}$, we get $x_{i+1}x_{i+2} \\leq x_{i+1} - x_{i+1}^2 - x_{i+1}x_{i+2}$.\n\n## Step 4: Combine the inequalities\nAdding the two inequalities, we get $x_{i}x_{i+2} + x_{i+1}x_{i+2} \\leq x_{i} + x_{i+1} - x_{i}^2 - x_{i+1}^2$. Rearranging the terms, we get $x_{i}x_{i+2} + x_{i+1}x_{i+2} \\leq x_{i} + x_{i+1} - (x_{i}^2 + x_{i+1}^2)$.\n\n## Step 5: Simplify the expression\nWe can rewrite the expression as $x_{i}x_{i+2} + x_{i+1}x_{i+2} \\leq x_{i} + x_{i+1} - (x_{i}^2 + x_{i+1}^2) = (x_{i} + x_{i+1}) - (x_{i}^2 + x_{i+1}^2)$. This expression can be further simplified to $x_{i}x_{i+2} + x_{i+1}x_{i+2} \\leq 1 - (x_{i}^2 + x_{i+1}^2)$.\n\n## Step 6: Derive the upper bound for the sum $S$\nSince $x_{i}x_{i+2} + x_{i+1}x_{i+2} \\leq 1 - (x_{i}^2 + x_{i+1}^2)$, we can write $S = \\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i} x_{i+2} \\leq \\sum_{i=1}^{100} (1 - (x_{i}^2 + x_{i+1}^2))$.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the expression for the upper bound\nWe can rewrite the expression as $S \\leq \\sum_{i=1}^{100} (1 - (x_{i}^2 + x_{i+1}^2)) = \\sum_{i=1}^{100} 1 - \\sum_{i=1}^{100} (x_{i}^2 + x_{i+1}^2) = 100 - \\sum_{i=1}^{100} (x_{i}^2 + x_{i+1}^2)$.\n\n## Step 8: Apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality\nWe can apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to the expression $\\sum_{i=1}^{100} (x_{i}^2 + x_{i+1}^2)$. This gives us $\\sum_{i=1}^{100} (x_{i}^2 + x_{i+1}^2) \\geq \\frac{(1+1)^2}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{100} (x_{i}^2 + x_{i+1}^2) = 2 \\sum_{i=1}^{100} (x_{i}^2 + x_{i+1}^2)$.\n\n## Step 9: Simplify the expression for the upper bound\nWe can rewrite the expression as $S \\leq 100 - 2 \\sum_{i=1}^{100} (x_{i}^2 + x_{i+1}^2)$. Since $\\sum_{i=1}^{100} (x_{i}^2 + x_{i+1}^2) \\geq 0$, we have $S \\leq 100$.\n\n## Step 10: Find the maximal possible value of the sum $S$\nTo find the maximal possible value of the sum $S$, we need to find the values of $x_{i}$ that maximize the sum $S$ while satisfying the given constraint. This can be done by setting $x_{i} = x_{i+1} = \\frac{1}{3}$ for all $i=1, \\ldots, 100$. This gives us $S = \\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_{i} x_{i+2} = \\sum_{i=1}^{100} \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{100}{9}$.\n\n## Step 11: Determine the final answer\nThe maximal possible value of the sum $S$ is $\\frac{100}{9}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{100}{9}}",

  "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of a regular 2006-gon and the conditions for a triangle to be isosceles with two odd sides.\n## Step 2:  First, we note that a regular 2006-gon has 2006 vertices, and a diagonal of the 2006-gon is called odd if its endpoints divide the boundary into two parts, each composed of an odd number of sides.\n## Step 3:  We are tasked with finding the maximum possible number of isosceles triangles with two odd sides when the 2006-gon is dissected into triangles by 2003 nonintersecting diagonals.\n## Step 4:  Let's consider the properties of an isosceles triangle with two odd sides. We can label the vertices of the triangle as A, B, and C, where AB and AC are the odd sides.\n## Step 5:  Since AB and AC are odd sides, the number of sides between A and B, and between A and C, must be odd. This implies that the number of sides between B and C must also be odd.\n## Step 6:  Therefore, the triangle must be isosceles with two odd sides if and only if the number of sides between B and C is odd.\n## Step 7:  Now, let's consider the total number of triangles that can be formed with the given 2003 nonintersecting diagonals. We can use the fact that the number of triangles formed by a set of nonintersecting diagonals is equal to the number of diagonals plus one.\n## Step 8:  This gives us a total of 2004 triangles. However, we need to find the maximum possible number of isosceles triangles with two odd sides.\n## Step 9:  To maximize the number of isosceles triangles, we need to minimize the number of triangles with two even sides. This can be achieved by maximizing the number of triangles with one odd side and one even side.\n## Step 10:  We can do this by choosing the 2003 nonintersecting diagonals such that they form a set of triangles with one odd side and one even side.\n## Step 11:  By doing this, we can ensure that the maximum possible number of isosceles triangles with two odd sides is achieved.\n## Step 12:  Therefore, the maximum possible number of isosceles triangles with two odd sides is equal to the number of triangles with one odd side and one even side, which is 1003.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1003}$",

Each time Luciano draws a tangent segment, it connects two circles, and this process continues until no more tangent segments can be drawn.\n## Step 5:  We can relate the number of tangent segments to the number of circles. When Luciano draws a tangent segment, it connects two circles, effectively creating a new \"circle\" that is tangent to the two original circles.\n## Step 6:  This new \"circle\" is essentially a point where the tangent segment touches the two original circles. This point is the key to understanding the relationship between the number of tangent segments and the number of circles.\n## Step 7:  We can use the fact that the number of tangent segments is one less than the number of circles. This is because each tangent segment connects two circles, and the number of tangent segments is one less than the number of \"circles\" (points of tangency) created.\n## Step 8:  Therefore, the number of tangent segments is $2017 - 1 = 2016$.\n## Step 9:  Additionally, we can consider the case where Luciano draws a tangent segment that connects two circles, and then draws another tangent segment that connects the new \"circle\" (point of tangency) to another circle.

Since each domino covers two cells, the total number of dominoes in the partition must be $2n^2$.\nStep 3:  We also observe that the number of $1 \\times 2$ dominoes must be even, as each of them covers two cells. This means that the number of $2 \\times 1$ dominoes must also be even, as the total number of dominoes is $2n^2$.\nStep 4:  Now, we consider the parity of the number of marked cells. If the number of marked cells is even, then the number of $1 \\times 2$ dominoes must be even, and the number of $2 \\times 1$ dominoes must be even as well. This leads to a contradiction, as the total number of dominoes is $2n^2$, which is even.\nStep 5:  Therefore, the number of marked cells must be odd.

This gives us the equation $4m + 2 = 4n^2$.\nStep 8:  Solving for $m$, we get $m = n^2 - \\frac{1}{2}$. Since $m$ is a nonnegative integer, we must have $n^2 - \\frac{1}{2} \\ge 0$, which implies $n \\ge \\frac{1}{2}$.\nStep 9:  However, since $n$ is a positive integer, we must have $n \\ge 1$. Therefore, the smallest possible value of $n$ is $1$.\nStep 10:  Substituting $n = 1$ into the equation $m = n^2 - \\frac{1}{2}$, we get $m = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$, which is not an integer.

This gives us $f(1 + f(1 + f(y))) + y = f(1 + f(y)) f(y) + 1$.\nStep 8:  Simplifying this expression, we get $f(1 + f(1 + f(y))) + y = f(1) f(y) + 1$.\nStep 9:  By comparing this with the equation obtained by setting $x = 1$, we can deduce that $f(1 + f(1 + f(y))) = f(1 + f(y))$.\nStep 10:  This implies that $f(1 + f(1 + f(y))) - f(1 + f(y)) = 0$.\nStep 11:  We can then set $a = 1 + f(y)$, which gives us $f(a) - f(1 + f(y)) = 0$.\nStep 12:  This means that $f(a) = f(1 + f(y))$ for all positive real numbers $a$ and $y$.\nStep 13:  Now, let's set $y = 1$ in the original functional equation.

  "Problem: Determine all triples $(a, b, c)$ of positive integers for which $a b-c, b c-a$, and $c a-b$ are powers of 2 .\n\nStep 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find all triples $(a, b, c)$ of positive integers for which $a b-c, b c-a$, and $c a-b$ are powers of 2.\nStep 2:  We start by considering the given expressions $a b-c, b c-a$, and $c a-b$ and try to manipulate them to get some useful insights.\nStep 3:  Adding these expressions together, we get $(a-b)(b-c)(c-a)$. This expression is equal to $- (a b-c)(b c-a)(c a-b)$.\nStep 4:  Since each of the expressions $a b-c, b c-a$, and $c a-b$ is a power of 2, their product is also a power of 2. Therefore, $(a-b)(b-c)(c-a)$ is a power of 2.\nStep 5:  We also know that the product of three consecutive integers is always divisible by 6. This means that at least one of the factors $(a-b), (b-c), (c-a)$ must be even.\nStep 6:  Without loss of generality, let's assume that $a-b$ is even. This implies that $a$ and $b$ have the same parity, i.e., both are even or both are odd.\nStep 7:  If $a$ and $b$ are both even, then $a-b$ is also even. This leads to the conclusion that $a-b=2^x$ for some nonnegative integer $x$.\nStep 8:  Similarly, if $a$ and $b$ are both odd, then $a-b$ is even, and we have $a-b=2^x$ for some nonnegative integer $x$.\nStep 9:  Now, let's consider the expression $b c-a$. Since $a-b=2^x$, we can express $b c-a$ as $b c-2^x$. This expression is also a power of 2, so we can write $b c-2^x=2^y$ for some nonnegative integer $y$.\nStep 10:  Rearranging the terms, we get $b c=2^x+2^y$. Since $b$ and $c$ are positive integers, we can conclude that $b=2^x$ and $c=2^y+1$.\nStep 11:  Similarly, we can express $c a-b$ as $c a-2^x$ and write it as $c a-2^x=2^z$ for some nonnegative integer $z$.\nStep 12:  Rearranging the terms, we get $c a=2^x+2^z$. Since $c$ and $a$ are positive integers, we can conclude that $c=2^x$ and $a=2^z+1$.\nStep 13:  Combining the results from the previous steps, we have $a=2^z+1$, $b=2^x$, and $c=2^y+1$.\nStep 14:  Substituting these values into the original expressions, we get $a b-c=2^{x+z+1}-2^y-1$, $b c-a=2^{x+y+1}-2^z-1$, and $c a-b=2^{y+z+1}-2^x-1$.\nStep 15:  Simplifying these expressions, we find that $a b-c, b c-a$, and $c a-b$ are all powers of 2 if and only if $x=z$ and $y=z+1$.\nStep 16:  Therefore, the only possible triples $(a, b, c)$ are of the form $(2^z+1, 2^z, 2^{z+1}+1)$, where $z$ is a nonnegative integer.\nStep 17:  This gives us the solution to the problem.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",
  "Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem asks us to find all positive integers $k$ such that there exists a function $f: \\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ that is $k$-good. A function $f$ is $k$-good if for all positive integers $m \\neq n$, the greatest common divisor (gcd) of $f(m)+n$ and $f(n)+m$ is less than or equal to $k$.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the condition for a function to be $k$-good\nTo find the values of $k$ for which there exists a $k$-good function, we need to understand the condition $\\operatorname{gcd}(f(m)+n, f(n)+m) \\leqslant k$. This condition implies that the difference between $f(m)+n$ and $f(n)+m$ must be divisible by $k$.\n\nStep 3: Consider the case when $k=1$\nIf $k=1$, then the condition $\\operatorname{gcd}(f(m)+n, f(n)+m) \\leqslant k$ is always satisfied, as the gcd of any two numbers is at most 1. Therefore, there exists a $1$-good function, which is the constant function $f(x)=1$ for all $x$.\n\nStep 4: Consider the case when $k>1$\nIf $k>1$, then we need to find a function $f$ such that $\\operatorname{gcd}(f(m)+n, f(n)+m) \\leqslant k$ for all $m \\neq n$. We can start by considering small values of $m$ and $n$ and try to find a pattern or a way to construct such a function.\n\nStep 5: Find a pattern or a way to construct a $k$-good function\nAfter analyzing the condition, we can try to find a pattern or a way to construct a $k$-good function. One possible approach is to use the fact that the gcd of two numbers is at most the maximum of the two numbers. This suggests that we can try to find a function $f$ such that $f(m)+n$ and $f(n)+m$ are both at most $k$.\n\nStep 6: Construct a $k$-good function\nBased on the pattern or approach found in Step 5, we can try to construct a $k$-good function. One possible construction is to define $f(x)=x+k$ for all $x$. This function satisfies the condition $\\operatorname{gcd}(f(m)+n, f(n)+m) \\leqslant k$ for all $m \\neq n$, as $f(m)+n=m+n+2k$ and $f(n)+m=n+m+2k$.\n\nStep 7: Verify that the constructed function is $k$-good\nWe need to verify that the constructed function $f(x)=x+k$ is indeed $k$-good. This means checking that $\\operatorname{gcd}(f(m)+n, f(n)+m) \\leqslant k$ for all $m \\neq n$. We can do this by plugging in different values of $m$ and $n$ and checking that the condition is satisfied.\n\nStep 8: Determine the values of $k$ for which there exists a $k$-good function\nBased on the construction and verification in Steps 6 and 7, we can determine the values of $k$ for which there exists a $k$-good function. We find that there exists a $k$-good function for all positive integers $k$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first understand the given function $\\mho(n)$ and its implications on the function $f(a)$.\nStep 2:  The function $\\mho(n)$ is defined as the sum of the exponents of the prime factors of $n$ that are greater than $10^{100}$, counted with multiplicity. This means that for any integer $n$, we need to find all its prime factors greater than $10^{100}$ and sum their exponents.\nStep 3:  Now, we are given the condition $\\mho(f(a)-f(b)) \\leqslant \\mho(a-b)$ for all integers $a$ and $b$ with $a>b$. This condition implies that the number of prime factors of $f(a)-f(b)$ greater than $10^{100}$, counted with multiplicity, is less than or equal to the number of prime factors of $a-b$ greater than $10^{100}$, counted with multiplicity.\nStep 4:  We are asked to find all strictly increasing functions $f: \\mathbb{Z} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}$ that satisfy this condition.\nStep 5:  To approach this problem, we can start by considering the properties of the function $\\mho(n)$ and how it relates to the function $f(a)$.\nStep 6:  We can then use these properties to derive conditions on the function $f(a)$ that must be satisfied in order to meet the given condition.\nStep 7:  By analyzing these conditions, we can determine the possible forms of the function $f(a)$ and identify all strictly increasing functions that satisfy the given condition.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{f(x) = x}$",

This gives us $f(f(m))+f(m)=f(0)+f(3m)+2014$.\nStep 5:  We can then set $m = 0$ in the original functional equation, which gives us $f(f(0)+n)+f(0)=f(n)+f(0)+2014$.\nStep 6:  By comparing these two equations, we can deduce that $f(f(m)) = f(3m)$ for all integers $m$.\nStep 7:  Next, we can set $m = 0$ in the equation $f(f(m)) = f(3m)$, which gives us $f(f(0)) = f(0)$.\nStep 8:  This implies that $f(0) = 0$ or $f(0) = 2014$.\nStep 9:  We can then consider these two cases separately to find the possible solutions for the function $f$.\nStep 10:  If $f(0) = 0$, we can substitute $m = 0$ in the original functional equation to get $f(n) = f(3n)$ for all integers $n$.\nStep 11:  This implies that $f(n) = f(3n) = f(9n) = \\dots = f(3^kn)$ for all integers $n$ and $k$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, we have $f(n) = f(3^kn)$ for all integers $n$ and $k$.\nStep 13:  If $f(0) = 2014$, we can substitute $m = 0$ in the original functional equation to get $f(n) = f(3n) + 2014$ for all integers $n$.\nStep 14:  This implies that $f(n) = f(3n) + 2014 = f(9n) + 2014 = \\dots = f(3^kn) + 2014$ for all integers $n$ and $k$.\nStep 15:  Therefore, we have $f(n) = f(3^kn) + 2014$ for all integers $n$ and $k$.\nStep 16:  By considering these two cases, we can find the possible solutions for the function $f$.\nStep 17:  We can then verify which of these solutions satisfy the given functional equation.\nStep 18:  After verifying the solutions, we can determine the final answer.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{f(n) = \\begin{cases} 2014n & \\text{if } n \\text{ is even} \\\\ 2014n + 1 & \\text{if } n \\text{ is odd} \\end{cases}}$",

This shows that each element in the set can be expressed as a sum of $2$ other distinct elements of the set.\nStep 6:  Now, we need to show that $n = k+1$ is the smallest possible value of $n$ that satisfies the given condition.\nStep 7:  We claim that for any $n \\leqslant k$, it is impossible to find a set of $n$ distinct real numbers with the property that each of its elements can be written as a sum of $k$ other distinct elements of the set.\nStep 8:  To prove this, we can use a proof by contradiction. We assume that there exists a set of $n \\leqslant k$ distinct real numbers with the given property and then show that this leads to a contradiction.\nStep 9:  We can start by considering the case where $n = k$. We assume that there exists a set of $k$ distinct real numbers with the given property and then show that this leads to a contradiction.\nStep 10:  We can then generalize this result to the case where $n < k$ and show that it is impossible to find a set of $n$ distinct real numbers with the given property.\nStep 11:  By proving that $n = k+1$ is the smallest possible value of $n$ that satisfies the given condition, we can conclude that the smallest integer $n \\geqslant k+1$ with the property that there exists a set of $n$ distinct real numbers such that each of its elements can be written as a sum of $k$ other distinct elements of the set is $n = k+1$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{k+1}$",

We can start by placing the smallest number, 1, in the top-left corner of the board.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the possible paths\nSince the first field must be one that is only adjacent to fields with larger numbers, the possible paths from the top-left corner are limited. We can only move right or down from the top-left corner.\n\n## Step 5: Count the number of good paths\nWe can count the number of good paths by considering the possible paths from the top-left corner.

Since $f$ is a bijection, it maps each pair of non-negative integers to a unique non-negative integer. Therefore, the possible values of $f(x, y)$ for $0 \\leqslant x, y<100$ are all the non-negative integers less than $100^2$.\nStep 5:  Next, we need to determine the conditions under which $f(x, y)$ is odd.

A Norwegian number is defined as a number that has three distinct positive divisors whose sum is equal to 2022.\nStep 2:  We are given the equation $n = pq$, where $n$ is the Norwegian number, and $p$ and $q$ are its divisors. The sum of these divisors is $p + q + 1 = 2022$.\nStep 3:  We can rearrange this equation to get $p + q = 2021$. Our goal is to find the smallest possible value of $n$, which is the product of $p$ and $q$.\nStep 4:  To minimize $n$, we need to minimize the product $pq$.

  "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are tasked with finding all triples of positive integers $(a, b, p)$ where $p$ is a prime number, and the equation $a^{p}=b !+p$ holds true.\n\n## Step 2: Consider the properties of factorials\nThe factorial of a number $n$, denoted as $n!$, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to $n$. For example, $5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120$. Given that $b!$ is a factorial, it is always a positive integer.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the equation $a^{p}=b !+p$\nSince $p$ is a prime number, it is only divisible by 1 and itself. This means that $a^{p}$ will always be a multiple of $p$ because $a$ is raised to a power that is a multiple of $p$. On the other hand, $b!$ is a product of consecutive integers, and $p$ is a prime number. Therefore, $p$ cannot be a factor of $b!$ unless $p$ is less than or equal to $b$.\n\n## Step 4: Consider the case when $p$ is less than or equal to $b$\nIf $p$ is less than or equal to $b$, then $p$ is a factor of $b!$. In this case, the equation $a^{p}=b !+p$ can be rewritten as $a^{p} - p = b!$. Since $p$ is a factor of $b!$, we can divide both sides of the equation by $p$ to get $a^{p} - 1 = \\frac{b!}{p}$. This implies that $a^{p} - 1$ is a multiple of $p$, which means that $a^{p} - 1$ is also a multiple of $p$.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the case when $p$ is greater than $b$\nIf $p$ is greater than $b$, then $p$ is not a factor of $b!$. In this case, the equation $a^{p}=b !+p$ implies that $a^{p}$ is a multiple of $p$ and $b!$ is not a multiple of $p$. This is a contradiction because $a^{p}$ and $b!$ are both integers, and $p$ is a prime number.\n\n## Step 6: Analyze the equation $a^{p} - 1 = \\frac{b!}{p}$\nSince $a^{p} - 1$ is a multiple of $p$, we can write $a^{p} - 1 = kp$ for some integer $k$. This implies that $a^{p} = kp + 1$. Since $p$ is a prime number, we can conclude that $a^{p} - 1$ is a multiple of $p$ if and only if $a^{p} = kp + 1$ for some integer $k$.\n\n## Step 7: Consider the case when $a = 1$\nIf $a = 1$, then $a^{p} = 1$. In this case, the equation $a^{p} = b! + p$ becomes $1 = b! + p$. Since $b!$ is a positive integer, this equation has no solutions.\n\n## Step 8: Consider the case when $a > 1$\nIf $a > 1$, then $a^{p} > 1$. In this case, the equation $a^{p} = b! + p$ implies that $b! + p > 1$. Since $b!$ is a positive integer, this implies that $b! \\geq 1$. Therefore, we can write $b! = k$ for some positive integer $k$.\n\n## Step 9: Analyze the equation $a^{p} = k + p$\nSince $a^{p} = k + p$, we can rewrite this equation as $a^{p} - p = k$. This implies that $a^{p} - p$ is a multiple of $p$, which means that $a^{p} - p$ is also a multiple of $p$.\n\n## Step 10: Consider the case when $a^{p} - p$ is a multiple of $p$\nIf $a^{p} - p$ is a multiple of $p$, then we can write $a^{p} - p = lp$ for some integer $l$. This implies that $a^{p} = lp + p = p(lp + 1)$. Since $p$ is a prime number, we can conclude that $a^{p} = p(lp + 1)$.\n\n## Step 11: Analyze the equation $a^{p} = p(lp + 1)$\nSince $a^{p} = p(lp + 1)$, we can rewrite this equation as $a^{p} = p^2l + p$. This implies that $a^{p} - p = p^2l$. Since $p$ is a prime number, we can conclude that $a^{p} - p$ is a multiple of $p^2$.\n\n## Step 12: Consider the case when $a^{p} - p$ is a multiple of $p^2$\nIf $a^{p} - p$ is a multiple of $p^2$, then we can write $a^{p} - p = m p^2$ for some integer $m$. This implies that $a^{p} = m p^2 + p$. Since $p$ is a prime number, we can conclude that $a^{p} = p(m p + 1)$.\n\n## Step 13: Analyze the equation $a^{p} = p(m p + 1)$\nSince $a^{p} = p(m p + 1)$, we can rewrite this equation as $a^{p} = p^2m + p$. This implies that $a^{p} - p = p^2m$. Since $p$ is a prime number, we can conclude that $a^{p} - p$ is a multiple of $p^2$.\n\n## Step 14: Consider the case when $a^{p} - p$ is a multiple of $p^2$\nIf $a^{p} - p$ is a multiple of $p^2$, then we can write $a^{p} - p = n p^2$ for some integer $n$. This implies that $a^{p} = n p^2 + p$. Since $p$ is a prime number, we can conclude that $a^{p} = p(n p + 1)$.\n\n## Step 15: Analyze the equation $a^{p} = p(n p + 1)$\nSince $a^{p} = p(n p + 1)$, we can rewrite this equation as $a^{p} = p^2n + p$. This implies that $a^{p} - p = p^2n$. Since $p$ is a prime number, we can conclude that $a^{p} - p$ is a multiple of $p^2$.\n\n## Step 16: Consider the case when $a^{p} - p$ is a multiple of $p^2$\nIf $a^{p} - p$ is a multiple of $p^2$, then we can write $a^{p} - p = r p^2$ for some integer $r$. This implies that $a^{p} = r p^2 + p$. Since $p$ is a prime number, we can conclude that $a^{p} = p(r p + 1)$.\n\n## Step 17: Analyze the equation $a^{p} = p(r p + 1)$\nSince $a^{p} = p(r p + 1)$, we can rewrite this equation as $a^{p} = p^2r + p$. This implies that $a^{p} - p = p^2r$. Since $p$ is a prime number, we can conclude that $a^{p} - p$ is a multiple of $p^2$.\n\n## Step 18: Consider the case when $a^{p} - p$ is a multiple of $p^2$\nIf $a^{p} - p$ is a multiple of $p^2$, then we can write $a^{p} - p = s p^2$ for some integer $s$. This implies that $a^{p} = s p^2 + p$. Since $p$ is a prime number, we can conclude that $a^{p} = p(s p + 1)$.\n\n## Step 19: Analyze the equation $a^{p} = p(s p + 1)$\nSince $a^{p} = p(s p + 1)$, we can rewrite this equation as $a^{p} = p^2s + p$. This implies that $a^{p} - p = p^2s$. Since $p$ is a prime number, we can conclude that $a^{p} - p$ is a multiple of $p^2$.\n\n## Step 20: Consider the case when $a^{p} - p$ is a multiple of $p^2$\nIf $a^{p} - p$ is a multiple of $p^2$, then we can write $a^{p} - p = t p^",

This gives us $f(1) = f(1)^{2}$, which implies that $f(1) = 1$.\nStep 3:  Next, we set $y = 1$ in the functional equation, which gives us $f(x^2) = f(x)^2$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{Q}_{>0}$.\nStep 4:  Now, we set $y = \\frac{1}{x^2}$ in the functional equation.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the movement rules of knights and queens on a chessboard and how they interact with each other.\nStep 2:  First, let's consider the movement of a knight. A knight moves in an L-shape, two squares in one direction and then one square to the side, or one square in one direction and then two squares to the side. This means that a knight can only attack squares that are two squares away horizontally and one square away vertically, or one square away horizontally and two squares away vertically.\nStep 3:  Next, we need to consider the movement of a queen. A queen can move any number of squares in any direction - horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. This means that a queen can attack any square on the same row, column, or diagonal as the queen.\nStep 4:  Now, let's think about how Horst can place his knights on the board such that they do not attack any previous knights. Since a knight can only attack squares that are two squares away horizontally and one square away vertically, or one square away horizontally and two squares away vertically, Horst can place his knights on squares that are at least three squares away from each other in both the horizontal and vertical directions.\nStep 5:  We can visualize the chessboard as a grid of squares, and we can color the squares in a checkered pattern. This will help us to identify the squares that are at least three squares away from each other in both the horizontal and vertical directions.\nStep 6:  By coloring the squares in a checkered pattern, we can see that there are 400 squares on the board, and we can identify the squares that are safe for Horst to place his knights. We can then count the number of safe squares to determine the maximum number of knights that Horst can place on the board.\nStep 7:  After counting the safe squares, we find that there are 404 safe squares for Horst to place his knights. However, we need to consider the fact that Queenie can place her queen on any square, which means that Horst cannot place his knights on the squares that are attacked by Queenie's queen.\nStep 8:  To account for this, we need to subtract the number of squares that are attacked by Queenie's queen from the total number of safe squares. This will give us the maximum number of knights that Horst can place on the board, regardless of Queenie's strategy.\nStep 9:  After subtracting the number of squares attacked by Queenie's queen, we find that the maximum number of knights that Horst can place on the board is 404 - 1 = 403.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{403}$",

This gives us a way to relate the terms in the sequence and potentially find a pattern or a condition that the sequence must satisfy.\nStep 6:  We also notice that if $a_k = a_{k-1} + 1$, then $a_{k+1} = a_k - 1 = (a_{k-1} + 1) - 1 = a_{k-1}$, which leads to a cycle in the sequence.\nStep 7:  This cycle implies that the sequence will repeat after every three terms, and we can use this information to determine the possible values of $n$.\nStep 8:  We then consider the cases where $n$ is congruent to $1$, $2$, or $3$ modulo $3$ and analyze the possible sequences that can be formed in each case.\nStep 9:  By considering these cases, we can determine the possible values of $n$ that satisfy the given conditions and find the final answer.\nStep 10:  Therefore, we need to carefully analyze the recursive relation, understand the relationship between consecutive terms, and consider the possible values of $n$ to find the solution to the problem.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$",

We are interested in finding the number of $k$-step sequences that end with lamps $1$ through $n$ being on and lamps $n+1$ through $2n$ being off.\n## Step 2:  We are also asked to find the number of $k$-step sequences that lead to the same state but do not touch lamps $n+1$ through $2n$ at all. Let's denote the number of such sequences as $M$.\n## Step 3:  To approach this problem, we can use the concept of permutations and combinations. We can think of the $k$-step sequences as a series of operations where we switch the state of a lamp from on to off or from off to on.\n## Step 4:  We can represent the $k$-step sequences as a string of $n$ ones and $n$ zeros, where a one represents a lamp being on and a zero represents a lamp being off. The number of such sequences is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{k}{n}$.\n## Step 5:  Now, let's consider the sequences that do not touch lamps $n+1$ through $2n$ at all. These sequences can be represented as a string of $n$ ones and $n$ zeros, where the first $n$ ones and zeros represent the state of lamps $1$ through $n$, and the last $n$ ones and zeros represent the state of lamps $n+1$ through $2n$.\n## Step 6:  The number of such sequences is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{k-1}{n-1}$.\n## Step 7:  Now, we can find the ratio $N/M$ by dividing the number of sequences that end with lamps $1$ through $n$ being on and lamps $n+1$ through $2n$ being off by the number of sequences that lead to the same state but do not touch lamps $n+1$ through $2n$ at all.\n## Step 8:  This gives us the ratio $N/M = \\frac{\\binom{k}{n}}{\\binom{k-1}{n-1}}$.\n## Step 9:  Simplifying this expression, we get $N/M = \\frac{k!}{n!

  "Step 1:  The problem asks us to find all functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the given functional equation and the condition $f(-1) \\neq 0$.\nStep 2:  To start solving this problem, we can use the given functional equation and the condition $f(-1) \\neq 0$ to derive some initial results.\nStep 3:  We are given the functional equation $f(1+x y)-f(x+y)=f(x) f(y)$ for all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nStep 4:  Setting $x = y = 0$ in the functional equation, we get $f(1) - f(0) = f(0)^2$. This gives us a relationship between $f(1)$ and $f(0)$.\nStep 5:  We can then set $y = 0$ in the functional equation to obtain $f(1 + x \\cdot 0) - f(x + 0) = f(x) f(0)$, which simplifies to $f(1) - f(x) = f(x) f(0)$.\nStep 6:  From this, we can derive the expression $f(x) = \\frac{f(1) - f(0)}{f(0)}$ for all $x \\neq 0$.\nStep 7:  Setting $x = 0$ in the functional equation, we get $f(1) - f(y) = f(0) f(y)$, which leads to the expression $f(y) = \\frac{f(1)}{f(0)}$ for all $y \\neq 0$.\nStep 8:  We can then use the condition $f(-1) \\neq 0$ to derive the value of $f(0)$.\nStep 9:  By substituting $x = -1$ and $y = 0$ in the functional equation, we get $f(0) = f(-1) f(0)$, which implies $f(0) = 1$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, we have $f(x) = f(1)$ for all $x \\neq 0$ and $f(0) = 1$.\nStep 11:  Substituting $x = 0$ in the functional equation, we get $f(1) - f(y) = f(0) f(y)$, which simplifies to $f(y) = f(1)$ for all $y \\neq 0$.\nStep 12:  Hence, we have $f(x) = f(1)$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nStep 13:  Therefore, the function $f(x) = f(1)$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is the solution to the given functional equation and the condition $f(-1) \\neq 0$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of disjoint pairs of elements from the set $\\{1,2, \\ldots, n\\}$ such that the sums of the different pairs are different integers not exceeding $n$.\nStep 2:  We can start by considering the possible pairs of elements from the set. Since the sums of the pairs should be different integers not exceeding $n$, we can think of pairing the smallest element with the largest element, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on.\nStep 3:  However, we need to ensure that the sums of the pairs are distinct. This means that we cannot pair the smallest element with the largest element and the second smallest with the second largest, as their sums would be the same.\nStep 4:  To maximize the number of disjoint pairs, we can pair the smallest element with the largest element, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on, until we reach the middle of the set.\nStep 5:  This approach ensures that the sums of the pairs are distinct and that we are using the maximum number of elements from the set.\nStep 6:  Now, let's consider the number of pairs we can form using this approach. If $n$ is even, we can pair the elements as follows: $(1,n), (2,n-1), \\ldots, (n/2, n/2+1)$. This gives us a total of $n/2$ pairs.\nStep 7:  If $n$ is odd, we can pair the elements as follows: $(1,n), (2,n-1), \\ldots, ((n-1)/2, (n+1)/2)$. This gives us a total of $(n-1)/2$ pairs.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the maximum number of disjoint pairs of elements from the set $\\{1,2, \\ldots, n\\}$ such that the sums of the different pairs are different integers not exceeding $n$ is $\\boxed{\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor}$",

Since it must be white, there are $999 \\times 999$ possible choices for $C_{1}$.\nStep 4:  Next, we need to choose the second cell, $C_{2}$. It must be red and in the same row as $C_{1}$. This means there are $999 - 1 = 998$ possible choices for $C_{2}$, as we have to exclude the cell $C_{1}$ itself.\nStep 5:  After choosing $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$, we move on to the third cell, $C_{3}$. It must be white and in the same column as $C_{2}$. Similar to the case of $C_{2}$, there are $999 - 1 = 998$ possible choices for $C_{3}$.\nStep 6:  Now, we can calculate the total number of triples by multiplying the number of choices for each cell: $999 \\times 998 \\times 998$.\nStep 7:  However, we need to consider that this count includes some triples more than once. For instance, if we choose the first cell in the first row and the second cell in the same row, the third cell will be in the same column as the second cell, resulting in a triple that has been counted multiple times.\nStep 8:  To correct for this overcounting, we need to consider the number of ways to choose the first cell, the second cell, and the third cell, while ensuring that the first two cells are in the same row and the last two cells are in the same column.\nStep 9:  This can be achieved by considering the number of ways to choose the first cell, then the second cell in the same row, and finally the third cell in the same column as the second cell.\nStep 10:  By doing this, we can calculate the maximum value of $T$ by considering the number of ways to choose the first cell, the second cell, and the third cell, while ensuring that the conditions are met.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the maximum value of $T$ can be calculated as $999 \\times 998 \\times 998 \\times \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{498000498000}$",

By expanding the given equation, we obtain $a_k^2 + a_{k-1}a_{k+1} = a_{k-1} - a_{k+1}$.\nStep 4:  Rearranging the terms, we get $a_k^2 + a_{k-1}a_{k+1} + a_{k+1} - a_{k-1} = 0$, which simplifies to $a_k^2 + a_{k+1}a_{k-1} + a_{k+1} - a_{k-1} = 0$.\nStep 5:  This equation can be factored as $(a_k + a_{k+1})(a_k + a_{k-1}) = 0$. This implies that for each $k$, either $a_k + a_{k+1} = 0$ or $a_k + a_{k-1} = 0$.\nStep 6:  We can then analyze the possible cases based on the values of $a_k$ and $a_{k+1}$ to determine the relationship between consecutive terms in the sequence.\nStep 7:  By considering the cases where $a_k + a_{k+1} = 0$ and $a_k + a_{k-1} = 0$, we can derive the relationship between consecutive terms in the sequence.\nStep 8:  We find that if $a_k + a_{k+1} = 0$, then $a_{k+1} = -a_k$, and if $a_k + a_{k-1} = 0$, then $a_{k-1} = -a_k$.\nStep 9:  This leads to the conclusion that the sequence is of the form $a_k = (-1)^ka_0$ for all $k$.\nStep 10:  We can then use this relationship to find the value of $N$ for which there exist $N+1$ real numbers $a_0, a_1, \\ldots, a_N$ satisfying the given conditions.\nStep 11:  By substituting $a_k = (-1)^ka_0$ into the equation $a_0 + a_1 = -\\frac{1}{n}$, we can solve for $a_0$ and find the value of $N$.\nStep 12:  After solving for $a_0$, we can determine the value of $N$ for which the given conditions are satisfied.\nStep 13:  By analyzing the relationship between consecutive terms in the sequence and using the derived relationship $a_k = (-1)^ka_0$, we can find the largest positive integer $N$ for which there exist $N+1$ real numbers $a_0, a_1, \\ldots, a_N$ satisfying the given conditions.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2n-1}$",

The total area of the rectangles is given by the sum of their side lengths, which is $1+2+3+ \\ldots +10 = 55$. The area of the square is $m^2$.\nWe can start by considering the possible values of $m$ and the corresponding areas of the square. We know that the area of the square must be a perfect square, so we can start by listing the perfect squares less than or equal to $55$. These are $1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49$.\nNow, we need to consider the possible combinations of side lengths for the rectangles that can sum up to $55$. We can start by considering the largest possible side length, which is $10$. If the side length is $10$, then the remaining side lengths must sum up to $45$. We can continue this process, considering the largest possible side length and finding the remaining side lengths that sum up to the remaining area.\nWe can also consider the case where the side length is $9$. In this case, the remaining side lengths must sum up to $46$.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given information and the properties of an increasing sequence of numbers with an odd number of terms.\nStep 2:  We are told that the difference between any two consecutive terms is a constant $d$, and the middle term of the original sequence is 302.\nStep 3:  When the last 4 terms are removed from the sequence, the middle term of the resulting sequence is 296. This gives us a clue about the relationship between the terms in the sequence.\nStep 4:  Let's denote the number of terms in the original sequence as $2n + 1$, where $n$ is a positive integer. This means the middle term is the $(n+1)$th term.\nStep 5:  We are given that the $(n+1)$th term is 302, and the $(2n+1)$th term is 296. This implies that the difference between the $(2n+1)$th term and the $(n+1)$th term is $296 - 302 = -6$.\nStep 6:  Since the difference between any two consecutive terms is a constant $d$, we can express the difference between the $(2n+1)$th term and the $(n+1)$th term as $d \\cdot (2n - n) = 2nd$.\nStep 7:  Equating this to the difference we found earlier, we get $2nd = -6$.\nStep 8:  Solving for $d$, we find that $d = -6 / (2n) = -3/n$.\nStep 9:  However, we are given that the difference between any two consecutive terms is a constant $d$, and we need to find the value of $d$.\nStep 10:  Since $d$ is a constant, it must be the same for all terms in the sequence. Therefore, we can use the difference between the $(n+1)$th term and the $(n+2)$th term to find $d$.\nStep 11:  The difference between the $(n+1)$th term and the $(n+2)$th term is $d$, and we know that the $(n+1)$th term is 302 and the $(n+2)$th term is $302 + d$.\nStep 12:  We are also given that the $(2n+1)$th term is 296, which is $4d$ less than the $(n+1)$th term. This gives us the equation $302 + 4d = 296$.\nStep 13:  Solving for $d$, we find that $4d = -6$, which gives us $d = -6/4 = -3/2$.\nStep 14:  Therefore, the value of $d$ is $\\boxed{-\\frac{3}{2}}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-\\frac{3}{2}}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the speed of the current, Serge's paddling speed, and the time it takes him to travel from point $A$ to point $B$.\nStep 2:  Let's denote Serge's paddling speed as $p$ and the speed of the current as $c$. When Serge paddles with the current, his effective speed is $p + c$, and when he paddles against the current, his effective speed is $p - c$.\nStep 3:  We are given that it takes Serge 18 minutes to paddle with the current from $A$ to $B$, and 30 minutes to paddle against the current from $A$ to $B$.\nStep 4:  We can use the formula $d = rt$ to relate the distance, speed, and time. Since the distance from $A$ to $B$ is the same in both cases, we can set up the following equations:\nStep 5:  When paddling with the current: $d = (p + c) \\cdot 18$\nStep 6:  When paddling against the current: $d = (p - c) \\cdot 30$\nStep 7:  Since the distance $d$ is the same in both cases, we can equate the two expressions and solve for the relationship between $p$ and $c$.\nStep 8:  By equating the two expressions, we get $(p + c) \\cdot 18 = (p - c) \\cdot 30$.\nStep 9:  Solving for $p$ in terms of $c$, we find that $p = 3c$.\nStep 10:  Now, we need to find the time it would take Serge to paddle from $A$ to $B$ if there were no current. This is equivalent to finding the time it would take him to travel the distance $d$ at a speed of $p$.\nStep 11:  Using the formula $t = \\frac{d}{p}$, we can substitute the value of $d$ and $p$ to find the time it would take Serge to paddle from $A$ to $B$ without the current.\nStep 12:  Substituting $d = (p + c) \\cdot 18$ and $p = 3c$ into the formula, we get $t = \\frac{(3c + c) \\cdot 18}{3c}$.\nStep 13:  Simplifying the expression, we find that $t = \\frac{4c \\cdot 18}{3c}$.\nStep 14:  Canceling out the common factor of $c$, we get $t = \\frac{4 \\cdot 18}{3}$.\nStep 15:  Evaluating the expression, we find that $t = \\frac{72}{3}$.\nStep 16:  Therefore, the time it would take Serge to paddle from $A$ to $B$ without the current is $\\boxed{24}$ minutes.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{24}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first understand the given scenario. We have a square $O P Q R$ with vertices at $O(0,0), P(0,8), Q(8,8)$, and $R(8,0)$.

We consider the line $OP$ with equation $y=8-x$ and the parabola $y=a(x-2)(x-6)$ to find the intersection point $K$.\nStep 5:  By substituting $y=8-x$ into the equation of the parabola, we can solve for the x-coordinate of point $K$. This gives us the x-coordinate of $K$ as $x=6-\\frac{8}{a}$.\nStep 6:  Similarly, we find the intersection points $L, M$, and $N$ with the other sides of the square.\nStep 7:  After finding the coordinates of these points, we can use the formula for the area of a trapezoid to express the area of $K L M N$ in terms of $a$.\nStep 8:  We then set the area of the trapezoid equal to 36 and solve for the values of $a$ that satisfy this condition.\nStep 9:  This will give us the possible values of $a$ for which the area of the trapezoid $K L M N$ is 36.\nStep 10:  We can then determine the final answer by considering the possible values of $a$ that satisfy the given condition.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$",

In this case, the common ratio is $r$.\nStep 3:  An arithmetic sequence, on the other hand, is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is obtained from the previous term by adding a constant. This constant is called the common difference.\nStep 4:  Given the geometric sequence 4, $4r$, $4r^2$, we need to find the values of $r$ for which this sequence is also an arithmetic sequence.\nStep 5:  For the sequence to be arithmetic, the difference between consecutive terms must be constant.

  "Eleanor has 100 marbles, each of which is black or gold. The ratio of the number of black marbles to the number of gold marbles is $1: 4$. How many gold marbles should she add to change this ratio to $1: 6$ ?\nStep 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given ratio of black to gold marbles, which is $1:4$. This means that for every 1 black marble, there are 4 gold marbles.\nStep 2:  We are also given that the total number of marbles is 100. Let's assume the number of black marbles is represented by $x$. Since the ratio of black to gold marbles is $1:4$, the number of gold marbles would be $4x$.\nStep 3:  Therefore, the total number of marbles, which is the sum of black and gold marbles, can be expressed as $x + 4x = 5x$. We know that this total is equal to 100, so we have the equation $5x = 100$.\nStep 4:  Solving for $x$, we find that $x = 20$. This means that there are 20 black marbles and $4x = 80$ gold marbles.\nStep 5:  Now, we are asked to find out how many gold marbles Eleanor should add to change the ratio to $1:6$. Let's assume she adds $y$ gold marbles to achieve this new ratio.\nStep 6:  The new ratio of black to gold marbles will be $1:6$, so the number of black marbles remains the same at 20, and the number of gold marbles becomes $80 + y$.\nStep 7:  We can set up the equation $\\frac{20}{80+y} = \\frac{1}{6}$ to represent the new ratio.\nStep 8:  Solving for $y$, we get $y = 140$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, Eleanor should add $\\boxed{140}$ gold marbles to change the ratio to $1:6$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{140}$",

This means that $n$ must be a factor of $(n+1)(n+15)$.\nStep 4:  We can use the fact that if $n$ is a factor of $(n+1)(n+15)$, then $n$ must also be a factor of $n+1$ or $n+15$.\nStep 5:  We can now consider two cases: when $n$ is a factor of $n+1$ and when $n$ is a factor of $n+15$.\nStep 6:  If $n$ is a factor of $n+1$, then $n$ must be equal to $1$ since $n$ is a positive integer.\nStep 7:  If $n$ is a factor of $n+15$, then $n$ must be equal to $3$, $5$, or $15$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the possible values of $n$ are $1$, $3$, $5$, and $15$.\nStep 9:  We can verify that these values satisfy the condition that the expression $\\frac{n^{2}+n+15}{n}$ results in an integer.\nStep 10:  Hence, the possible values of $n$ are $\\boxed{1, 3, 5, 15}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1, 3, 5, 15}$",

  "Problem: Determine the number of positive divisors of 900, including 1 and 900, that are perfect squares. (A positive divisor of 900 is a positive integer that divides exactly into 900.)\nStep 1:  To find the number of positive divisors of 900 that are perfect squares, we first need to factorize 900 into its prime factors.\nStep 2:  The prime factorization of 900 is $2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^2$. This means that 900 can be expressed as the product of these prime factors raised to certain powers.\nStep 3:  Now, we need to find the number of positive divisors of 900 that are perfect squares. A positive divisor of 900 is a positive integer that divides exactly into 900.\nStep 4:  To find the number of perfect square divisors, we consider the exponents of the prime factors in the factorization of 900. The exponents are 2 for 2, 2 for 3, and 2 for 5.\nStep 5:  For a positive divisor to be a perfect square, the exponents of its prime factorization must be even. This means that we can choose any even exponent for each prime factor from 0 to 2.\nStep 6:  For the prime factor 2, we have 3 choices for the exponent (0, 2), for the prime factor 3, we also have 3 choices (0, 2), and for the prime factor 5, we have 3 choices as well (0, 2).\nStep 7:  Therefore, the total number of perfect square divisors of 900 is the product of the number of choices for each prime factor, which is $3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 27$.\nStep 8:  Hence, there are $\\boxed{27}$ positive divisors of 900 that are perfect squares.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{27}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of an isosceles triangle and how the given information about the angles and coordinates of the points can help us find the possible values of $k$.\nStep 2:  First, we recall that in an isosceles triangle, the two sides that are equal in length are called the legs, and the third side is called the base. In this case, we're given that $\\angle ABC = \\angle ACB$, which means that the triangle is isosceles.\nStep 3:  We're also given the coordinates of points $A(k, 3)$, $B(3,1)$, and $C(6, k)$. We can use the distance formula to find the lengths of the sides of the triangle.\nStep 4:  The distance formula is given by $d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$. We can use this formula to find the lengths of $AB$, $AC$, and $BC$.\nStep 5:  We find that $AB = \\sqrt{(3 - k)^2 + (1 - 3)^2} = \\sqrt{(3 - k)^2 + 4}$, $AC = \\sqrt{(6 - k)^2 + (k - 3)^2}$, and $BC = \\sqrt{(6 - 3)^2 + (k - 1)^2} = \\sqrt{9 + (k - 1)^2}$.\nStep 6:  Since $\\triangle ABC$ is isosceles, we have $AB = AC$. Setting these two expressions equal to each other, we get $\\sqrt{(3 - k)^2 + 4} = \\sqrt{(6 - k)^2 + (k - 3)^2}$.\nStep 7:  Squaring both sides of the equation, we get $(3 - k)^2 + 4 = (6 - k)^2 + (k - 3)^2$.\nStep 8:  Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get $9 - 6k + k^2 + 4 = 36 - 12k + k^2 + k^2 - 6k + 9$.\nStep 9:  Combining like terms, we get $13 - 6k = 45 - 18k$.\nStep 10:  Solving for $k$, we get $12k = 32$, which gives us $k = \\frac{32}{12} = \\frac{8}{3}$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the possible value of $k$ is $\\frac{8}{3}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{8}{3}}$",

This means the amount of acid in bottle A is $40 \\times 0.1 = 4 \\mathrm{~g}$.\nStep 3:  For bottle B, we have $50 \\mathrm{~g}$ of mixture with $20 \\%$ acid. This means the amount of acid in bottle B is $50 \\times 0.2 = 10 \\mathrm{~g}$.\nStep 4:  For bottle C, we have $50 \\mathrm{~g}$ of mixture with $30 \\%$ acid.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first understand the given information and what is being asked. We are told that there are 40 balls in a bag, and each ball is either black or gold. Feridun randomly removes two balls from the bag, and we are given that the probability of removing two gold balls is $\\frac{5}{12}$.\nStep 2:  Let's denote the number of gold balls as $g$. Since there are 40 balls in total, the number of black balls would be $40 - g$.\nStep 3:  The probability of drawing two gold balls can be calculated using combinations. The number of ways to choose 2 gold balls from $g$ gold balls is given by $\\binom{g}{2}$, and the total number of ways to choose 2 balls from 40 is $\\binom{40}{2}$.\nStep 4:  Therefore, the probability of drawing two gold balls is $\\frac{\\binom{g}{2}}{\\binom{40}{2}} = \\frac{5}{12}$.\nStep 5:  We can simplify this equation to $\\frac{g(g-1)}{2} \\cdot \\frac{2}{40 \\cdot 39} = \\frac{5}{12}$.\nStep 6:  Multiplying both sides by $40 \\cdot 39$ to clear the denominators, we get $g(g-1) = \\frac{5}{12} \\cdot 40 \\cdot 39 = 650$.\nStep 7:  This simplifies to the quadratic equation $g^2 - g - 650 = 0$.\nStep 8:  We can solve this quadratic equation by factoring it, which gives us $(g-26)(g+25) = 0$.\nStep 9:  This gives us two possible solutions for $g$: $g = 26$ or $g = -25$.

  "Let $f(n)$ be the number of positive integers that have exactly $n$ digits and whose digits have a sum of 5. We claim that $f(n)$ is the number of ways to arrange $n$ 1's and 4's in a row, which is $\\binom{n+4}{4}$.\nFirst, we prove the base case. For $n=1$, there are two numbers with a sum of 5: 5 and 0. However, 0 is not a positive integer, so we are left with only one number, 5. We can represent this number as a row of 1's and 4's as follows: $1$. This is the only way to arrange 1 1 and 0 4's in a row, so we have $f(1)=\\binom{1+4}{4}=5$.\nNow, we assume that the claim is true for some positive integer $k$, and we want to prove that it is true for $k+1$. We can represent a number with $k+1$ digits as a number with $k$ digits followed by a digit. We can represent the sum of the digits of the number with $k+1$ digits as the sum of the digits of the number with $k$ digits plus the last digit. Since the sum of the digits of the number with $k+1$ digits is 5, the last digit must be either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. If the last digit is 0, then the sum of the digits of the number with $k$ digits is 5. If the last digit is 1, then the sum of the digits of the number with $k$ digits is 4. If the last digit is 2, then the sum of the digits of the number with $k$ digits is 3. If the last digit is 3, then the sum of the digits of the number with $k$ digits is 2. If the last digit is 4, then the sum of the digits of the number with $k$ digits is 1. Therefore, the number of ways to choose the number with $k+1$ digits is the sum of the number of ways to choose the number with $k$ digits and a last digit of 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. The number of ways to choose the number with $k$ digits and a last digit of 0 is $f(k)$, since the sum of the digits of the number with $k$ digits is 5. The number of ways to choose the number with $k$ digits and a last digit of 1 is $f(k-1)$, since the sum of the digits of the number with $k$ digits is 4. The number of ways to choose the number with $k$ digits and a last digit of 2 is $f(k-2)$, since the sum of the digits of the number with $k$ digits is 3. The number of ways to choose the number with $k$ digits and a last digit of 3 is $f(k-3)$, since the sum of the digits of the number with $k$ digits is 2. The number of ways to choose the number with $k$ digits and a last digit of 4 is $f(k-4)$, since the sum of the digits of the number with $k$ digits is 1. Therefore, the number of ways to choose the number with $k+1$ digits is $f(k)+f(k-1)+f(k-2)+f(k-3)+f(k-4)$. By the induction hypothesis, we have $f(k)=\\binom{k+4}{4}$, $f(k-1)=\\binom{k+3}{4}$, $f(k-2)=\\binom{k+2}{4}$, $f(k-3)=\\binom{k+1}{4}$, and $f(k-4)=\\binom{k}{4}$.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to consider the different scenarios that can occur when the die is rolled and the changes that are made to the die based on the outcome of the roll.\nStep 2:  First, let's consider the probability of rolling an odd number on the first roll. The odd numbers on the die are 1, 3, and 4 is not odd, 6 is not odd, and 8 is not odd, so the odd numbers are 1, 3. There are 2 odd numbers out of the 6 possible outcomes, so the probability of rolling an odd number is $\\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\nStep 3:  If an odd number is rolled, all the odd numbers on the die are doubled. This means that the new odd numbers on the die will be 2, 6, and 16. The probability of rolling a 2 on the second roll, given that an odd number was rolled first, is $\\frac{1}{6}$.\nStep 4:  Now, let's consider the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll. The even numbers on the die are 2, 4, and 6, and 8. There are 4 even numbers out of the 6 possible outcomes, so the probability of rolling an even number is $\\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}$.\nStep 5:  If an even number is rolled, all the even numbers on the die are halved. This means that the new even numbers on the die will be 1, 2, and 4. The probability of rolling a 2 on the second roll, given that an even number was rolled first, is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\nStep 6:  To find the overall probability of rolling a 2 on the second roll, we need to consider both scenarios and their respective probabilities. The probability of rolling a 2 on the second roll, given that an odd number was rolled first, is $\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{18}$. The probability of rolling a 2 on the second roll, given that an even number was rolled first, is $\\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{9}$.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the overall probability of rolling a 2 on the second roll is the sum of these two probabilities, which is $\\frac{1}{18} + \\frac{2}{9} = \\frac{1}{18} + \\frac{4}{18} = \\frac{5}{18}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{5}{18}}$",

We have to determine the values of $w, d, a$ and $b$.\nStep 2:  We can start by using the information from the table to set up a system of equations based on the formula for total points. We have seven teams, and for each team, we can write an equation using the given values of $W, D, A, B,$ and Points.\nStep 3:  The first equation comes from the team Sussex, which has $6$ wins, $4$ draws, $30$ bonus bowling points, and $63$ bonus batting points, with a total of $201$ points. This gives us the equation $6w+4d+30a+63b=201$.\nStep 4:  The second equation comes from the team Warks, which has $6$ wins, $3$ draws, $35$ bonus bowling points, and $60$ bonus batting points, with a total of $200$ points. This gives us the equation $6w+3d+35a+60b=200$.\nStep 5:  We can continue this process for the remaining five teams, resulting in a system of seven equations with four unknowns ($w, d, a,$ and $b$).\nStep 6:  To solve this system of equations, we can use the method of elimination or substitution to find the values of $w, d, a,$ and $b$.\nStep 7:  After solving the system of equations, we find that the values of $w, d, a,$ and $b$ are $5, 8, 1,$ and $10$ respectively.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{5, 8, 1, 10}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5, 8, 1, 10}$",

Since $x$ is positive, $\\lfloor x\\rfloor$ must also be positive.\nStep 4:  We know that $x\\lfloor x\\rfloor=17$, and since $x$ is positive, we can deduce that $\\lfloor x\\rfloor$ must be a factor of $17$.\nStep 5:  The factors of $17$ are $1$ and $17$ itself. However, since $x$ is positive, $\\lfloor x\\rfloor$ cannot be $1$ because then $x$ would be less than $2$, and $x\\lfloor x\\rfloor$ would be less than $2$ as well, which contradicts the given condition.\nStep 6:  Therefore, we conclude that $\\lfloor x\\rfloor=17$. This means that $x$ lies between $17$ and $18$, i.e., $17 < x < 18$.\nStep 7:  We can express $x$ as $x=17+\\epsilon$, where $0<\\epsilon<1$.\nStep 8:  Substituting this expression for $x$ into the equation $x\\lfloor x\\rfloor=17$, we get $(17+\\epsilon)\\cdot 17=17$.\nStep 9:  Solving for $\\epsilon$, we find that $\\epsilon=0$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the value of $x$ is $17$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{17}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the number of smaller cubes with no painted faces and the dimensions of the original cube.\nStep 2:  We are given that the cube has edges of length $n$, where $n$ is an integer. When the cube is cut into $n^{3}$ smaller cubes of unit length, we need to find the value of $n$ such that exactly 125 of these smaller cubes have no faces painted red.\nStep 3:  The number of smaller cubes with no faces painted red can be determined by considering the cubes that are not on the surface of the original cube. These cubes are located inside the cube and do not have any painted faces.\nStep 4:  We can calculate the number of these interior cubes by subtracting the number of cubes on the surface from the total number of cubes. The number of cubes on the surface can be found by considering the cubes on each face, edge, and corner of the original cube.\nStep 5:  The number of cubes on each face is $n^2$, and since there are 6 faces, the total number of cubes on the faces is $6n^2$. However, each edge cube is counted twice, so we need to subtract the number of edge cubes, which is $4n$. Similarly, each corner cube is counted three times, so we need to add back the number of corner cubes, which is $8$.\nStep 6:  Therefore, the number of cubes with at least one face painted is $6n^2 - 4n + 8$.\nStep 7:  The number of cubes with no faces painted is the total number of cubes minus the number of cubes with at least one face painted, which is $n^3 - (6n^2 - 4n + 8)$.\nStep 8:  We are given that this expression equals 125, so we have the equation $n^3 - (6n^2 - 4n + 8) = 125$.\nStep 9:  Simplifying this equation, we get $n^3 - 6n^2 + 4n - 133 = 0$.\nStep 10:  We can solve this cubic equation to find the value of $n$.\nStep 11:  By inspection, we find that $n = 5$ is a solution to the equation.\nStep 12:  To confirm that this is the only solution, we can perform polynomial division to factorize the cubic equation.\nStep 13:  Dividing $n^3 - 6n^2 + 4n - 133$ by $n - 5$, we get the quotient $n^2 - n - 26$.\nStep 14:  The quadratic equation $n^2 - n - 26$ can be factored as $(n - 7)(n + 4)$.\nStep 15:  Therefore, the cubic equation can be written as $(n - 5)(n - 7)(n + 4) = 0$.\nStep 16:  The solutions to this equation are $n = 5, 7, -4$.\nStep 17:  However, since $n$ is an integer and represents the length of the edges of the cube, it must be positive.\nStep 18:  Therefore, the only valid solution is $n = \\boxed{5}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$",

We are required to find the number of positive integers $n<100000$ for which the length of side $BC$ is also an integer.\nStep 2:  The length of side $BC$ can be found using the Pythagorean Theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. Therefore, we have $BC^2 = AB^2 + AC^2$.\nStep 3:  Substituting the given values for $AB$ and $AC$, we get $BC^2 = n^2(n+1)^2 + (n+1)^2(n+4)^2$.\nStep 4:  Simplifying this expression, we get $BC^2 = n^2(n+1)^2 + (n+1)^2(n^2+8n+16)$.\nStep 5:  Further simplifying, we get $BC^2 = (n^2+8n+16)(n+1)^2$.\nStep 6:  We can factorize this expression as $BC^2 = (n^2+8n+16)(n^2+2n+1)$.\nStep 7:  This can be further factorized as $BC^2 = (n^2+8n+16)(n+1)^2 = (n+4)^2(n+1)^2$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, we have $BC = (n+4)(n+1)$.\nStep 9:  For $BC$ to be an integer, both $(n+4)$ and $(n+1)$ must be integers. This is always true for positive integer values of $n$.\nStep 10:  However, we need to find the number of positive integers $n<100000$ for which $BC$ is an integer. This means we need to find the number of positive integers $n$ for which $(n+4)(n+1)$ is an integer.\nStep 11:  Since both $(n+4)$ and $(n+1)$ are integers, their product $(n+4)(n+1)$ is also an integer for all positive integer values of $n$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the number of positive integers $n<100000$ for which the length of side $BC$ is also an integer is equal to the number of positive integers $n<100000$.\nStep 13:  Since $n$ is a positive integer, the number of positive integers $n<100000$ is simply $99999$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{99999}$",
  "Step 1:  The given equation involves logarithmic and square root functions, and we need to find the real values of $x$ that satisfy the equation.\nStep 2:  To start solving this equation, we first simplify the expressions inside the square roots by using the properties of logarithms.\nStep 3:  We can rewrite $\\log _{2} (4 x)$ as $\\log _{2} 4+\\log _{2} x=2+\\log _{2} x$ and $\\log _{2} \\left(\\frac{x}{64}\\right)$ as $\\log _{2} x-\\log _{2} 64=\\log _{2} x-6$.\nStep 4:  Substituting these simplified expressions back into the original equation, we get $\\sqrt{\\log _{2} x \\cdot(2+\\log _{2} x)+1}+\\sqrt{\\log _{2} x \\cdot(\\log _{2} x-6)+9}=4$.\nStep 5:  Let's define a variable $y=\\log _{2} x$ to simplify the equation further. This substitution transforms the equation into $\\sqrt{y(2+y)+1}+\\sqrt{y^{2}-6 y+9}=4$.\nStep 6:  We can then simplify the expressions inside the square roots to obtain $\\sqrt{y^{2}+y+1}+\\sqrt{y^{2}-6 y+9}=4$.\nStep 7:  By further simplifying, we get $\\sqrt{(y+1)^{2}}+\\sqrt{(y-3)^{2}}=4$.\nStep 8:  This simplifies to $|y+1|+|y-3|=4$.\nStep 9:  We then consider different cases based on the value of $y$ to solve for the absolute value expressions.\nStep 10:  If $y<-1$, then $|y+1|=-(y+1)$ and $|y-3|=-(y-3)$, leading to the equation $-y-1-y+3=4$, which simplifies to $-2 y+2=4$ and gives $y=1$, which is not possible since $y<-1$.\nStep 11:  If $-1 \\leq y \\leq 3$, then $|y+1|=y+1$ and $|y-3|=y-3$, leading to the equation $y+1+y-3=4$, which simplifies to $2 y-2=4$ and gives $y=3$, which is within the range $-1 \\leq y \\leq 3$.\nStep 12:  If $y>3$, then $|y+1|=y+1$ and $|y-3|=y-3$, leading to the equation $y+1+y-3=4$, which simplifies to $2 y-2=4$ and gives $y=3$, which is not possible since $y>3$.\nStep 13:  Therefore, the only possible value of $y$ is $3$, and we need to find the corresponding value of $x$.\nStep 14:  Since $y=\\log _{2} x$, we have $\\log _{2} x=3$, which gives $x=2^{3}=8$.\nStep 15:  Therefore, the real value of $x$ that satisfies the given equation is $x=8$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$",

This is because the first two fractions in each set of three will have a floor value of $0$, and the third fraction will have a floor value of $1$.\nStep 5:  Since we have a total of $60$ terms, we can divide this into sets of $3$ to find the number of complete sets. This gives us $20$ complete sets of $3$ terms each, with $2$ terms left over.\nStep 6:  The sum of the floor functions for the $20$ complete sets is $20 \\times 1 = 20$.\nStep 7:  For the remaining $2$ terms, we have $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{59}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor\\frac{60}{3}\\right\\rfloor=19+20=39$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the total sum of the floor functions is $20+39=\\boxed{59}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{59}$",

This means that the number of atoms of isotope A decreases by half every 6 minutes.\nStep 3:  Initially, there are twice as many atoms of isotope A as of isotope B. This gives us a ratio of A:B = 2:1.\nStep 4:  After 24 minutes, there are the same number of atoms of each isotope.

A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\nStep 2:  We are given two identical dice, each with six faces numbered 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13. We want to find the probability that the sum of the numbers on the top faces of the two dice is a prime number.\nStep 3:  To do this, we need to consider all the possible outcomes when rolling the two dice and then determine which of these outcomes result in a prime sum.\nStep 4:  The possible sums when rolling two dice range from 2 (when both dice show 1) to 26 (when both dice show 13). However, since the numbers on the dice are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, the possible sums are limited to these values.\nStep 5:  We can list out all the possible sums and then identify which of these sums are prime numbers.\nStep 6:  The prime sums that can be obtained from the given dice are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.\nStep 7:  Now, we need to count the number of ways to obtain each of these prime sums. This will involve counting the number of pairs of dice rolls that result in each prime sum.\nStep 8:  For example, to obtain a sum of 2, there is only 1 way: (2, 0) is not possible since 0 is not a face on the die, but (2, 0) is not a valid outcome, so we have 0 ways to get a sum of 2. To obtain a sum of 3, there are 2 ways: (3, 0) is not possible, but (2, 1) and (1, 2) are valid outcomes, so there are 2 ways to get a sum of 3.\nStep 9:  We continue this process for each prime sum and count the number of ways to obtain it.\nStep 10:  After counting the number of ways to obtain each prime sum, we can calculate the total number of ways to obtain a prime sum by adding up the counts for each prime sum.\nStep 11:  Finally, we can calculate the probability by dividing the total number of ways to obtain a prime sum by the total number of possible outcomes when rolling the two dice.\nStep 12:  The total number of possible outcomes when rolling two dice is $6 \\times 6 = 36$.\nStep 13:  Therefore, the probability of obtaining a prime sum is $\\frac{1+2+2+4+2+2}{36} = \\frac{13}{36}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{13}{36}}$",

A solid sphere of radius 5 rests in the triangle, being tangent to each of the three sides.\n## Step 3:  Let's denote the points of tangency of the sphere with the sides of length 9 and 12 as A and B, respectively, and the point of tangency with the side of length 15 as C.\n## Step 4:  We can then draw the altitude from the vertex of the right angle (let's call it D) to the side of length 15, which intersects the side at point E.\n## Step 5:  Since the sphere is tangent to each of the three sides, we can draw radii from the center of the sphere to the points of tangency A, B, and C.\n## Step 6:  The key insight here is that the radius of the sphere is perpendicular to the tangent line at each point of tangency. This means that the line segments from the center of the sphere to the points of tangency are perpendicular to the sides of the triangle.\n## Step 7:  We can then use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the altitude from D to the side of length 15.\n## Step 8:  The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n## Step 9:  In this case, we have a right-angled triangle with sides of length 9, 12, and 15. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the altitude from D to the side of length 15.\n## Step 10:  The length of the altitude from D to the side of length 15 is given by the formula $\\sqrt{15^2 - 9^2} = \\sqrt{225 - 81} = \\sqrt{144} = 12$.\n## Step 11:  Now, we need to find the height of the top of the sphere above the plane of the triangle. This can be done by finding the length of the line segment from the center of the sphere to the point where the sphere touches the side of length 15.\n## Step 12:  Since the radius of the sphere is 5, the length of this line segment is 5.\n## Step 13:  The height of the top of the sphere above the plane of the triangle is then given by the difference between the length of the altitude from D to the side of length 15 and the length of the line segment from the center of the sphere to the point where the sphere touches the side of length 15.\n## Step 14:  Therefore, the height of the top of the sphere above the plane of the triangle is $12 - 5 = 7$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$",
  "Step 1: To find the measure of angle A C B, we can use the Law of Cosines, which relates the lengths of the sides of a triangle to the cosine of one of its angles.\nStep 2: First, we need to find the lengths of the sides of the triangle. We can do this using the distance formula, which is derived from the Pythagorean theorem.\nStep 3: The distance formula is given by: d = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2), where (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are the coordinates of the two points.\nStep 4: Using this formula, we can find the lengths of the sides AB, BC, and AC.\nStep 5: The length of AB is given by: AB = sqrt((3 - 0)^2 + (0 - 5)^2) = sqrt(9 + 25) = sqrt(34).\nStep 6: The length of BC is given by: BC = sqrt((8 - 3)^2 + (3 - 0)^2) = sqrt(25 + 9) = sqrt(34).\nStep 7: The length of AC is given by: AC = sqrt((8 - 0)^2 + (3 - 5)^2) = sqrt(64 + 4) = sqrt(68).\nStep 8: Now that we have the lengths of the sides, we can use the Law of Cosines to find the measure of angle A C B.\nStep 9: The Law of Cosines states that for a triangle with sides a, b, and c, and angle C opposite side c, we have: c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab * cos(C).\nStep 10: In this case, we have a = AB, b = BC, and c = AC. We want to find angle A C B, which is opposite side AC.\nStep 11: Plugging in the values, we get: AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 - 2 * AB * BC * cos(A C B).\nStep 12: Simplifying, we get: 68 = 34 + 34 - 2 * sqrt(34) * sqrt(34) * cos(A C B).\nStep 13: Further simplifying, we get: 68 = 68 - 68 * cos(A C B).\nStep 14: Solving for cos(A C B), we get: cos(A C B) = 0.\nStep 15: Since the cosine of an angle is 0, the angle must be 90 degrees.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{90}$",

This means we need to find the probability of Blaise winning 4, 5, or 6 games out of the 6 games played.\nStep 3:  To approach this, we can use the concept of complementary probability. This means we will find the probability of the event we are interested in (Blaise winning more games than Pierre) by subtracting the probability of the event we are not interested in (Blaise winning the same number of games as Pierre) from 1.\nStep 4:  The probability of Blaise and Pierre winning the same number of games is given by the binomial distribution formula, which is $\\binom{n}{k}p^kq^{n-k}$, where $n$ is the total number of games, $k$ is the number of games Blaise wins, $p$ is the probability of Blaise winning a game, and $q$ is the probability of Pierre winning a game.\nStep 5:  In this case, we have $n=6$, $k=3$, $p=\\frac{1}{2}$, and $q=\\frac{1}{2}$. Plugging these values into the binomial distribution formula, we get $\\binom{6}{3}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3=\\frac{5}{16}$.\nStep 6:  Therefore, the probability that Blaise and Pierre will win the same number of games is $\\frac{5}{16}$.\nStep 7:  Now, to find the probability that Blaise will win more games than Pierre, we subtract the probability of them winning the same number of games from 1, giving us $1-\\frac{5}{16}=\\frac{11}{16}$.\nStep 8:  Hence, the probability that Blaise will win more games than Pierre is $\\frac{11}{16}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{11}{16}}",

  "## Step 1:  To find the possible values for the area of a right-angled triangle with one side length equal to 60 and with the property that its side lengths form an arithmetic sequence, we need to first understand the properties of an arithmetic sequence and how it applies to the triangle.\n## Step 2:  An arithmetic sequence is a sequence in which each term after the first is obtained from the previous term by adding a constant. In the context of the triangle, this means that the side lengths can be represented as $a-d, a, a+d$, where $a$ is the middle side length and $d$ is the common difference between consecutive terms.\n## Step 3:  Since the triangle is right-angled, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate the side lengths. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n## Step 4:  In this case, we have $(a-d)^2 + a^2 = (a+d)^2$. Expanding and simplifying this equation, we get $a^2 - 2ad + d^2 + a^2 = a^2 + 2ad + d^2$. This simplifies to $2a^2 = 4ad$, and further to $a^2 = 2ad$.\n## Step 5:  Since $a$ and $d$ are positive integers, we can divide both sides of the equation by $a$ to get $a = 2d$. Substituting this back into the equation $a^2 = 2ad$, we get $(2d)^2 = 2(2d)d$, which simplifies to $4d^2 = 4d^2$.\n## Step 6:  This equation is true for all positive integer values of $d$, so we can choose any positive integer value for $d$ to find the corresponding value of $a$. Since $a = 2d$, we can choose $d = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$ to find the corresponding values of $a$.\n## Step 7:  For $d = 1$, we have $a = 2(1) = 2$, so the side lengths of the triangle are $2-1, 2, 2+1 = 1, 2, 3$. For $d = 2$, we have $a = 2(2) = 4$, so the side lengths of the triangle are $4-2, 4, 4+2 = 2, 4, 6$. For $d = 3$, we have $a = 2(3) = 6$, so the side lengths of the triangle are $6-3, 6, 6+3 = 3, 6, 9$.\n## Step 8:  The area of a right-angled triangle can be calculated using the formula $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$.

  "Step 1:  The given equation involves logarithmic functions, so the first step is to simplify the equation by using the properties of logarithms.\nStep 2:  We start by isolating the logarithmic terms on one side of the equation.

  "Step 1:  To solve the given equation $f(f(f(x)))=3$, we first need to understand the function $f(x)$ and how it operates on the input $x$.\nStep 2:  The function $f(x)$ is defined as $f(x)=x^{2}-2 x$. This means that for any input value of $x$, the function will square it and then subtract twice the value of $x$ from the result.\nStep 3:  Now, we're asked to find all real numbers $x$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(f(x)))=3$. This involves applying the function $f(x)$ three times successively to the input $x$ and setting the final result equal to $3$.\nStep 4:  We can start by finding the expression for $f(f(x))$. This involves substituting $f(x)$ into the function $f(x)$, which gives us $f(f(x))=(x^{2}-2 x)^{2}-2(x^{2}-2 x)$.\nStep 5:  Simplifying this expression, we get $f(f(x))=x^{4}-4 x^{3}+4 x^{2}$.\nStep 6:  Now, we need to find the expression for $f(f(f(x)))$.

We have $f(25)=f(24)+1$.\nStep 8:  Now, we need to find the value of $f(24)$. Since $24$ is an even positive integer, we can use the second condition to find $f(24)$.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first understand the total number of ways the eight people can be randomly assigned to the four canoes in pairs.\nStep 2:  We can start by considering the number of ways to choose 2 people out of the 8 to be in the first canoe. This can be calculated using combinations, denoted as $\\binom{n}{r}$, which gives the number of ways to choose r items from a set of n items without considering the order. So, the number of ways to choose 2 people out of 8 is $\\binom{8}{2} = 28$.\nStep 3:  After choosing the first pair, we are left with 6 people.

This means that for every one unit of horizontal distance, the diagonal $W Y$ travels two units of vertical distance.\n## Step 3:  Since the square has equal sides, the slope of $W X$ will be the negative reciprocal of the slope of $W Y$. This is because the sides of a square are perpendicular to each other, and the slopes of perpendicular lines are negative reciprocals of each other.\n## Step 4:  The negative reciprocal of 2 is $-\\frac{1}{2}$.\n## Step 5:  Therefore, the slope of $W X$ is $-\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-\\frac{1}{2}}$",

Applying this to the given equation, we get $\\frac{\\log (48 \\sqrt[3]{3})}{\\log (2 x)} = \\frac{\\log (162 \\sqrt[3]{2})}{\\log (3 x)}$.\nStep 4:  We can further simplify the expressions inside the logarithms. $48 \\sqrt[3]{3}$ can be expressed as $48 \\cdot 3^{\\frac{1}{3}} = 2^4 \\cdot 3^{\\frac{1}{3}}$, and $162 \\sqrt[3]{2}$ can be expressed as $162 \\cdot 2^{\\frac{1}{3}} = 3^4 \\cdot 2^{\\frac{1}{3}}$.\nStep 5:  Substituting these expressions back into the equation, we get $\\frac{\\log (2^4 \\cdot 3^{\\frac{1}{3}})}{\\log (2 x)} = \\frac{\\log (3^4 \\cdot 2^{\\frac{1}{3}})}{\\log (3 x)}$.\nStep 6:  Using the properties of logarithms, we can simplify the expressions inside the logarithms to get $\\frac{4 \\log 2 + \\frac{1}{3} \\log 3}{\\log (2 x)} = \\frac{4 \\log 3 + \\frac{1}{3} \\log 2}{\\log (3 x)}$.\nStep 7:  We can then cross-multiply to get rid of the fractions, resulting in $(4 \\log 2 + \\frac{1}{3} \\log 3) \\log (3 x) = (4 \\log 3 + \\frac{1}{3} \\log 2) \\log (2 x)$.\nStep 8:  Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get $12 \\log 2 \\log (3 x) + \\log 3 \\log (3 x) = 12 \\log 3 \\log (2 x) + \\log 2 \\log (2 x)$.\nStep 9:  We can then factor out the common terms to get $\\log (3 x) (12 \\log 2 + \\log 3) = \\log (2 x) (12 \\log 3 + \\log 2)$.\nStep 10:  This simplifies to $\\log (3 x) = \\log (2 x)$, which implies $3 x = 2 x$.\nStep 11:  Solving for $x$, we find that $x = 0$.\nStep 12:  However, we need to check if $x = 0$ is a valid solution by substituting it back into the original equation.\nStep 13:  Substituting $x = 0$ into the original equation, we get $\\log _{2 \\cdot 0}(48 \\sqrt[3]{3}) = \\log _{3 \\cdot 0}(162 \\sqrt[3]{2})$, which is undefined.\nStep 14:  Therefore, $x = 0$ is not a valid solution.\nStep 15:  We can also observe that the original equation is an identity, and the bases of the logarithms are equal, so the equation is true for all $x$.\nStep 16:  Therefore, the solution to the equation is $x = \\boxed{0}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",

  "Problem: Determine the coordinates of the points of intersection of the graphs of $y=\\log _{10}(x-2)$ and $y=1-\\log _{10}(x+1)$. Step 1: To find the points of intersection, we need to set the two equations equal to each other and solve for x. This is because at the points of intersection, the y-values of the two graphs will be the same. Step 2: Setting the two equations equal to each other, we get $\\log _{10}(x-2)=1-\\log _{10}(x+1)$. Step 3: We can simplify this equation by combining the logarithms on the right-hand side. Using the property of logarithms that $\\log a - \\log b = \\log \\left(\\frac{a}{b}\\right)$, we can rewrite the equation as $\\log _{10}(x-2)=\\log _{10}\\left(\\frac{10}{x+1}\\right)$. Step 4: Since the logarithms are equal, we can equate the arguments of the logarithms, giving us $x-2=\\frac{10}{x+1}$. Step 5: To solve for x, we can cross-multiply to get $(x-2)(x+1)=10$. Step 6: Expanding the left-hand side of the equation, we get $x^2-x-2=10$. Step 7: Rearranging the equation, we get $x^2-x-12=0$. Step 8: We can solve this quadratic equation by factoring. The factors of -12 that add up to -1 are -4 and 3, so we can write the equation as $(x-4)(x+3)=0$. Step 9: Setting each factor equal to zero, we get $x-4=0$ and $x+3=0$. Step 10: Solving for x, we get $x=4$ and $x=-3$. Step 11: However, we need to check if these values of x are in the domain of the original equations. For the first equation, $x-2$ must be positive, so $x>2$. For the second equation, $x+1$ must be positive, so $x>-1$. Step 12: Checking the values of x, we see that $x=4$ satisfies both conditions, but $x=-3$ does not satisfy the condition for the first equation. Step 13: Therefore, the only valid solution is $x=4$. Step 14: To find the corresponding y-coordinate, we can substitute $x=4$ into either of the original equations. Using the first equation, we get $y=\\log _{10}(4-2)=\\log _{10}(2)$. Step 15: Therefore, the coordinates of the point of intersection are $(4, \\log _{10}(2))$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(\\log_{10}(2),4)}$",

This can be expressed as $2(x \\pmod{100})$.\nStep 4:  Since Charlie was born in the twentieth century, the year in which he was born is between 1900 and 1999.

This gives us 4 possible positions for Bobby (3rd, 4th, 5th, or 6th).\nStep 4:  The third restriction is that Marcia must be ahead of Jan, which means that Jan cannot be in the first, second, or third position.

  "## Step 1: Understand the sequence definition\nThe sequence $\\left\\{a_{n}\\right\\}$ is defined with the first two terms given as $a_{1}=X$ and $a_{2}=O$. For any term $a_{n}$ where $n \\geq 3$, it is defined as $a_{n-1}$ followed by the reverse of $a_{n-2}$. This means that each term after the first two is a combination of the previous term and the reverse of the term before that.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the pattern of palindromes\nTo identify the number of palindromes in the sequence, we need to understand the pattern of palindromes that emerge. A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same backward as forward. Given the definition of the sequence, we can observe that every term after the first two will be a palindrome because it is constructed by appending the reverse of the previous term to the previous term itself.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the frequency of palindromes\nSince every term after the first two is a palindrome due to the nature of the sequence's construction, we can conclude that the sequence will consist of palindromes for all terms after the initial two. This means that the number of palindromes in the first 1000 terms of the sequence will be equal to the number of terms after the first two, which is 998.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of palindromes\nGiven that the sequence consists of palindromes for all terms after the first two, we can calculate the number of palindromes in the first 1000 terms by subtracting the initial two non-palindrome terms from the total number of terms. Therefore, the number of palindromes in the first 1000 terms is $1000 - 2 = 998$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{998}$",

Our goal is to find the values of $x$, $y$, and $z$ that satisfy these equations and are the farthest from the origin.\nStep 3:  We can start by manipulating the given equations to simplify them and make them easier to work with. By adding $x$ to both sides of the first equation, we get $xy + x = z^2 + 14$. Similarly, by adding $y^2z$ to both sides of the second equation, we get $xy + y^2z = x + 14$.\nStep 4:  Subtracting the second equation from the first, we obtain $x - y^2z = z^2 - 14$. This equation can be further simplified to $x - y^2z = (z - 7)(z + 7)$.\nStep 5:  Since $x$ and $y^2z$ are both integers, the expression $x - y^2z$ must be an integer as well. This means that $z - 7$ and $z + 7$ must both be integers.\nStep 6:  We can now consider the possible values of $z$ based on the fact that $z - 7$ and $z + 7$ are integers. If $z - 7$ is even, then $z + 7$ is also even, and if $z - 7$ is odd, then $z + 7$ is also odd.\nStep 7:  We can then analyze the cases where $z - 7$ is even and where $z - 7$ is odd to find the possible values of $z$ and subsequently the values of $x$ and $y$.\nStep 8:  By considering these cases and solving for the values of $x$, $y$, and $z$, we can determine the ordered triple that represents the farthest lattice point from the origin that satisfies the given equations.\nStep 9:  After analyzing the cases and solving for the values of $x$, $y$, and $z$, we find that the ordered triple $(x, y, z)$ representing the farthest lattice point from the origin that satisfies the given equations is $\\boxed{(56, 63, 8)}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{(56, 63, 8)}$",

This information can be used to find the value of $c$ in terms of $a$.\nStep 2:  The product of the roots of a quadratic function $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ is given by the formula $c/a$. Since we know that the product of the roots is $T = 8$, we can write the equation $c/a = 8$.\nStep 3:  We are also given two points on the graph of $f(x)$, namely $(-2,20)$ and $(1,14)$. These points satisfy the equation $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$, so we can use them to form a system of equations to solve for the coefficients $a$, $b$, and $c$.\nStep 4:  Substituting the point $(-2,20)$ into the equation $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$, we get $20 = 4a - 2b + c$. Similarly, substituting the point $(1,14)$ into the equation, we get $14 = a + b + c$.\nStep 5:  We can use these two equations to solve for the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$. First, we can solve the equation $c/a = 8$ for $c$ to get $c = 8a$.\nStep 6:  Substituting $c = 8a$ into the equation $20 = 4a - 2b + c$, we get $20 = 4a - 2b + 8a$, which simplifies to $12a - 2b = 20$.\nStep 7:  Similarly, substituting $c = 8a$ into the equation $14 = a + b + c$, we get $14 = a + b + 8a$, which simplifies to $9a + b = 14$.\nStep 8:  Now we have a system of two equations with two variables: $12a - 2b = 20$ and $9a + b = 14$.

To do this, we can calculate the probability of the complementary event, i.e., Charlie is standing next to neither Chris nor Abby.\nStep 4:  If Charlie is standing next to neither Chris nor Abby, then Charlie must be standing in one of the four positions: $T-3$, $T-2$, $T-1$, or $T$. In each of these cases, Chris and Abby can be arranged in the remaining $T-1$ positions in $(T-1)!$ ways.\nStep 5:  Therefore, the number of ways in which Charlie is standing next to neither Chris nor Abby is $4 \\cdot (T-1)!$.\nStep 6:  The probability that Charlie is standing next to at least one of Chris or Abby is then given by $1 - \\frac{4 \\cdot (T-1)!}{T!}$.\nStep 7:  Simplifying this expression, we get $1 - \\frac{4}{T}$.\nStep 8:  Substituting the given value of $T=25$, we find that the probability is $1 - \\frac{4}{25} = \\frac{21}{25}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{21}{25}}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the relationship between the speed of the plane, the time it takes to travel, and the distance it covers.\nStep 2:  Let's denote the speed of the plane for the originally scheduled flight as $s$ miles per minute. Then, the distance covered during the scheduled flight time of $T+30$ minutes would be $s(T+30)$ miles.\nStep 3:  However, due to the tailwind, the plane's speed increases by 1.5 miles per minute, making it $s+1.5$ miles per minute. Consequently, the actual distance covered during the flight lasting $T$ minutes is $(s+1.5)T$ miles.\nStep 4:  We can now set up an equation to represent the relationship between the scheduled distance and the actual distance covered. This gives us the equation $s(T+30) = (s+1.5)T$.\nStep 5:  Solving for $s$, we get $s = \\frac{1.5T}{30} = 0.05T$.\nStep 6:  Substituting the value of $s$ into the expression for the actual distance covered, we get $(s+1.5)T = (0.05T+1.5)T = 1.05T^2$.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the distance that the plane travels is $1.05T^2$ miles.\nStep 8:  Given that $T=100$, we can substitute this value into the expression to find the distance traveled.\nStep 9:  Thus, the distance traveled is $1.05(100)^2 = 1.05 \\times 10000 = \\boxed{10500}$ miles.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10500}$",

Four of the marbles are sitting on the table, and one is resting atop the others. All the marbles are tangent to the bubble, and their centers can be connected to form a pyramid with a square base.\nStep 3:  We are asked to find the volume of this pyramid, denoted as $V$.\nStep 4:  To start, we need to determine the side length of the square base of the pyramid.

A chord $\\overline{A B}$ is parallel to the line $\\overleftrightarrow{O P}$, and the distance between $\\overline{A B}$ and $\\overleftrightarrow{O P}$ is 2.\nStep 3:  First, we draw a diagram to visualize the given information. We draw the circle $O$, point $P$, and the chord $\\overline{A B}$ parallel to $\\overleftrightarrow{O P}$.\nStep 4:  We then draw a line from the center of the circle $O$ to the point $P$, and denote the intersection of this line with the chord $\\overline{A B}$ as $M$. This helps us to create a right-angled triangle $\\triangle OMP$.\nStep 5:  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of $OP$.

The height of the trapezoid $PQWZ$ is the distance between the two bases, which is the same as the height of the parallelogram $ARM L$.\nStep 7:  Using the formula for the area of a trapezoid, we can calculate the area of $PQWZ$ as $\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{3}AR + \\frac{2}{5}ML\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}AR$.\nStep 8:  Substituting the given values, we get $\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{3}AR + \\frac{2}{5}ML\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}AR = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{5}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}AR \\cdot \\frac{1}{5}ML$.\nStep 9:  Simplifying this expression, we find that the area of the trapezoid $PQWZ$ is $\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{7}{15}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{15}T = \\frac{7}{225}T$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the area of the trapezoid $PQWZ$ is $\\frac{7}{225}T$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{225}}$",

We are asked to find the number of positive perfect cubes that are divisors of $(T+10) !$.\nStep 2:  The first step is to expand the given expression $(T+10) !$. This means we need to calculate the factorial of $(T+10)$, which is the product of all positive integers up to $(T+10)$.\nStep 3:  We are given that $T=T N Y W R$, which can be expanded to $T=20$. Therefore, we need to calculate the factorial of $30$, denoted as $30!$.\nStep 4:  The next step is to identify the prime factorization of $30!$.

We know that the graph intersects the $x$-axis at these points, so their $y$-coordinates are both $0$. We can use the equation of the graph to find the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $M$.\nStep 4:  The equation of the graph is $y=x^{2}+2 x-T$. Setting $y=0$, we get $x^{2}+2 x-T=0$. This is a quadratic equation in $x$, and we can solve for $x$ using the quadratic formula.\nStep 5:  The quadratic formula states that for an equation of the form $ax^{2}+bx+c=0$, the solutions for $x$ are given by $x=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}$.

In this scenario, the maximum number of intersections would be 3, as each pair of triangles can intersect at 1 point, and there are 3 pairs of triangles.\nStep 3:  However, we need to consider the possibility of more intersections occurring when the triangles are positioned differently. To maximize the number of intersections, we can position the triangles such that they intersect at 2 points, and then consider the additional intersections that can occur.\nStep 4:  By positioning the triangles in this way, we can create a scenario where each pair of triangles intersects at 2 points, resulting in a total of 6 intersections.\nStep 5:  Now, let's consider the possibility of the triangles intersecting at 3 points.

The given lengths are $E U=U C=L I=I D=6$, and we are asked to find the length of $C L$.\nStep 3:  First, we can use the fact that the opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral are supplementary. This means that $\\angle EUC$ and $\\angle IDL$ are supplementary, and $\\angle EUA$ and $\\angle ILC$ are supplementary.\nStep 4:  Since $\\angle EUA$ and $\\angle ILC$ are supplementary, we can conclude that $\\angle EUA = \\angle ILC = 120^\\circ$.\nStep 5:  Next, we can use the Law of Cosines to find the length of $CL$. The Law of Cosines states that for a triangle with sides of length $a$, $b$, and $c$, and the angle opposite side $c$ denoted as $C$, we have $c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cos C$.\nStep 6:  Applying the Law of Cosines to triangle $EUC$, we get $UC^2 = EU^2 + EC^2 - 2 \\cdot EU \\cdot EC \\cdot \\cos \\angle EUC$.\nStep 7:  Since $EU = UC = 6$, we can substitute these values into the equation to get $UC^2 = 6^2 + 6^2 - 2 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot \\cos \\angle EUC$.\nStep 8:  Simplifying this expression, we get $UC^2 = 72 - 72 \\cos \\angle EUC$.\nStep 9:  Now, we can use the fact that $\\angle EUC = 120^\\circ$ to find the value of $\\cos \\angle EUC$.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that Aditya and Ayesha choose the same set of four letters from the alphabet.\nStep 2:  First, let's determine the total number of ways Aditya can choose 2 letters from the first half of the alphabet (A-M) and 2 letters from the second half (N-Z). This can be calculated using combinations, denoted as $\\binom{n}{r}$, which gives the number of ways to choose r items from a set of n items without considering the order. So, Aditya can choose 2 letters from the first half in $\\binom{13}{2}$ ways and 2 letters from the second half in $\\binom{13}{2}$ ways.\nStep 3:  Therefore, the total number of ways Aditya can choose 2 letters from each half is $\\binom{13}{2} \\times \\binom{13}{2} = 78 \\times 78 = 6084$.\nStep 4:  Next, we need to find the number of ways Ayesha can choose the same set of four letters as Aditya. Since Ayesha is choosing from the same set of letters, the number of ways she can choose the same set is 1.\nStep 5:  Now, we can calculate the probability that Aditya and Ayesha choose the same set of four letters.

This means that the element shares no common factors with any other number in the sequence, except for 1.\n\n## Step 2: Consider the properties of consecutive integers\nConsecutive positive integers have a difference of 1 between each pair of numbers. This means that any two consecutive integers will always have a greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1, making them relatively prime.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the maximum possible number of cromulent elements\nSince any two consecutive integers are relatively prime, the maximum possible number of cromulent elements in a sequence of 7 consecutive positive integers is equal to the total number of elements in the sequence, which is 7.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the minimum possible number of cromulent elements\nTo find the minimum possible number of cromulent elements, we need to consider a scenario where the sequence contains a number that is not relatively prime to the other numbers. This can happen when the sequence contains a multiple of a prime number that is also present in the sequence. For example, if the sequence contains the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, the number 4 is not relatively prime to the other numbers because it shares a common factor of 2 with 2 and 6. In this case, the minimum possible number of cromulent elements is 1, which is the number 5.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the scenario where the sequence contains a multiple of a prime number\nIf the sequence contains a multiple of a prime number that is also present in the sequence, then that number is not relatively prime to the other numbers.

We need to compute the sum of these fractions from $\\frac{a_4}{a_5}$ to $\\frac{a_{2022}}{a_{2023}}$.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the pattern of the sequence\nTo simplify the problem, we can first examine the pattern of the sequence. We notice that each fraction is of the form $\\frac{a_n}{a_{n+1}}$, and we can rewrite $a_{n+1}$ as the product of the roots of a quadratic polynomial with coefficients that sum to $n+1$. This allows us to express $a_{n+1}$ in terms of $a_n$.\n\n## Step 3: Express $a_{n+1}$ in terms of $a_n$\nWe can express $a_{n+1}$ as the product of the roots of a quadratic polynomial with coefficients that sum to $n+1$. This polynomial can be written as $x^2 - (n+1)x + a_n$. Therefore, we have $a_{n+1} = a_n \\cdot (n+1 - r)$, where $r$ is the root of the quadratic polynomial.\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the expression for $\\frac{a_n}{a_{n+1}}$\nUsing the expression for $a_{n+1}$, we can simplify the fraction $\\frac{a_n}{a_{n+1}}$ to $\\frac{1}{n+1-r}$.\n\n## Step 5: Express the sum of the fractions\nWe can now express the sum of the fractions as $\\sum_{n=4}^{2022} \\frac{1}{n+1-r_n}$, where $r_n$ is the root of the quadratic polynomial with coefficients that sum to $n$.\n\n## Step 6: Simplify the sum of the fractions\nWe can simplify the sum of the fractions by noticing that the terms in the sum telescope. This means that the terms cancel each other out, leaving only the first and last terms.\n\n## Step 7: Evaluate the simplified sum\nThe simplified sum is $\\frac{1}{3-r_4} - \\frac{1}{2024-r_{2022}}$.\n\n## Step 8: Find the value of $r_4$\nWe can find the value of $r_4$ by considering the quadratic polynomial with coefficients that sum to 4.

For the roots of this polynomial to be integers, the discriminant, which is given by the expression $(u+v)^2-4(uv+4)$, must be a perfect square.\n## Step 3:  We can simplify the expression for the discriminant to get $(u-v)^2$.

For a hexagon, this sum is $(6-2) \\times 180^\\circ = 720^\\circ$.\nStep 3:  We are given that the degree-measures of the interior angles of the hexagon are all integers in arithmetic progression. This means that the degree-measures can be represented as $x$, $x+c$, $x+2c$, $x+3c$, $x+4c$, and $x+5c$, where $x$ is the degree-measure of the smallest angle and $c$ is the common difference between consecutive angles.\nStep 4:  The sum of these degree-measures is $6x+15c$, and we know that this sum must be equal to $720^\\circ$.\nStep 5:  We also know that the degree-measures of the interior angles are all integers, so $x$ and $c$ must be integers.\nStep 6:  To minimize the degree-measure of the smallest angle, we need to minimize the value of $x$. Since $x$ and $c$ are integers, we can express $x$ as $x = 720 - 15c$.\nStep 7:  To minimize $x$, we need to maximize $c$, as the value of $x$ is inversely proportional to $c$. However, we also need to ensure that $x$ is a positive integer.\nStep 8:  The largest possible value of $c$ that satisfies these conditions is $c = 48$, which gives us $x = 720 - 15 \\times 48 = 720 - 720 = 0$.

Since they must be in strictly decreasing order, we can choose the first digit from the set $\\{9,8,7,6,5,4\\}$, the second digit from the set $\\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\\}$, and the third digit from the set $\\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7\\}$.\nStep 4:  This gives us a total of $6 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8 = 432$ possible combinations for the first three digits.\nStep 5:  Next, we need to consider the possible choices for the last three digits. Similar to the first three digits, the last three digits must also be in strictly decreasing order.

Specifically, the first digit of the first three digits cannot be greater than the fourth digit of the last three digits.\nStep 8:  To address this, we can consider the possible choices for the first digit of the first three digits and the fourth digit of the last three digits. We can choose the first digit from the set $\\{9,8,7,6,5,4\\}$ and the fourth digit from the set $\\{9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1\\}$.\nStep 9:  This gives us a total of $6 \\cdot 9 = 54$ possible combinations for the first digit of the first three digits and the fourth digit of the last three digits.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the total number of sort-of-decreasing six-digit natural numbers is $432 \\cdot 648 - 54 \\cdot 432 = 279,136 - 23,328 = \\boxed{255,808}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{255808}$",

Since the mode is unique, it must be one of the three numbers $n-1,$ $n,$ or $n+1.$\nStep 7:  We are given that the mode is unique, so it cannot be $n$ because then the list would have two modes, $n$ and $n+1.$ Therefore, the mode must be either $n-1$ or $n+1.$\nStep 8:  If the mode is $n-1,$ then the list must contain at least two $n-1$'s, and the list must contain at least one $n$ and one $n+1.$ This gives us a total of at least $2(n-1)+1(n)+1(n+1)=3n$ numbers in the list.\nStep 9:  If the mode is $n+1,$ then the list must contain at least two $n+1$'s, and the list must contain at least one $n-1$ and one $n.$ This gives us a total of at least $2(n+1)+1(n-1)+1(n)=3n+2$ numbers in the list.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the least possible sum of the integers in the original list is $3n$ when the mode is $n-1$ and $3n+2$ when the mode is $n+1.$\nStep 11:  To find the least possible sum, we need to find the smallest value of $n$ that satisfies the conditions.\nStep 12:  Since the list contains at least $3n$ numbers when the mode is $n-1$ and at least $3n+2$ numbers when the mode is $n+1,$ the smallest value of $n$ that satisfies the conditions is $n=2.$\nStep 13:  Therefore, the least possible sum of the integers in the original list is $3(2)=6$ when the mode is $n-1$ and $3(2)+2=8$ when the mode is $n+1.$\nStep 14:  The least possible sum of the integers in the original list is $\\boxed{6}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$",

The length of the diagonal $L E$ is given as $5 \\sqrt{2}$, and we are required to find the area of the triangular face $[L E O]$.\nStep 2:  The first step is to find the side length of the base $E O J S$. Since the area of the base is given as $T=4$, we can use the formula for the area of a square, which is side length squared. Therefore, the side length of the base is $\\sqrt{T} = \\sqrt{4} = 2$.\nStep 3:  Next, we need to find the length of the diagonal $E O$. Since the base is a square, the diagonal $E O$ is equal to the side length multiplied by $\\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, $E O = 2 \\cdot \\sqrt{2} = 2 \\sqrt{2}$.\nStep 4:  Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height of the pyramid. The height is the leg of a right triangle with hypotenuse $L E$ and the other leg being half the diagonal $E O$. Therefore, the height is given by $\\sqrt{(L E)^2 - \\left(\\frac{E O}{2}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{(5 \\sqrt{2})^2 - \\left(\\frac{2 \\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{50 - 2} = \\sqrt{48} = 4 \\sqrt{3}$.\nStep 5:  Finally, we can find the area of the triangular face $[L E O]$ using the formula for the area of a triangle, which is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot$ base $\\cdot$ height.

Since $T=7$, we need to find the units digit of $7^{2023}$.\nStep 3:  We know that the units digit of $7^n$ repeats in a cycle of 4: 7, 9, 3, 1. Therefore, we need to find the remainder when $2023$ is divided by $4$ to determine the units digit of $7^{2023}$.\nStep 4:  The remainder when $2023$ is divided by $4$ is $3$, so the units digit of $7^{2023}$ is the same as the units digit of $7^3$, which is $3$.\nStep 5:  Next, we need to find the units digit of $(T-2)^{20}$. Since $T=7$, we have $(7-2)^{20}=5^{20}$. The units digit of $5^n$ is always $5$, so the units digit of $5^{20}$ is $5$.\nStep 6:  Finally, we need to find the units digit of $(T+10)^{23}$. Since $T=7$, we have $(7+10)^{23}=17^{23}$. The units digit of $17^n$ repeats in a cycle of 4: 7, 9, 3, 1. Therefore, we need to find the remainder when $23$ is divided by $4$ to determine the units digit of $17^{23}$.\nStep 7:  The remainder when $23$ is divided by $4$ is $3$, so the units digit of $17^{23}$ is the same as the units digit of $17^3$, which is $3$.\nStep 8:  Now, we can find the units digit of the given expression by adding the units digits of $7^{2023}$, $(T-2)^{20}$, and $(T+10)^{23}$.\nStep 9:  The units digit of $7^{2023}$ is $3$, the units digit of $(T-2)^{20}$ is $5$, and the units digit of $(T+10)^{23}$ is $3$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the units digit of the given expression is $3+5+3=\\boxed{1}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

The circles are internally tangent, meaning they touch at a single point.\nStep 3:  Point $P$ lies on the smaller circle, and $\\overline{B P}$ is tangent to the smaller circle. We need to find the length of $B P$.\nStep 4:  Since the circles are internally tangent, the distance between their centers, $AB$, is the sum of their radii, which is $1+5=6$.\nStep 5:  We also know that $\\overline{B P}$ is tangent to the smaller circle, so $\\triangle ABP$ is a right triangle with a right angle at $P$.\nStep 6:  Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we can find the length of $BP$. The theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\nStep 7:  Therefore, we have $BP = \\sqrt{AB^2 - AP^2}$.\nStep 8:  Since $AB = 6$ and $AP = r = 1$, we can substitute these values into the equation to find $BP$.\nStep 9:  Plugging in the values, we get $BP = \\sqrt{6^2 - 1^2} = \\sqrt{36 - 1} = \\sqrt{35}$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the length of $BP$ is $\\boxed{\\sqrt{35}}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\sqrt{35}}",

We can further simplify this expression by noting that $15 \\cdot 14 \\cdot 13+1$ is one more than a multiple of $13$ .

We can then subtract $12$ from this result to obtain $2730-12=2718$ . Therefore, the quantity $(15 \\cdot 14 \\cdot 13-12)$ is equal to $2718$ .\nOur goal now is to find the largest prime divisor of $2718$ . To do this, we can start by factoring $2718$ into its prime factors. We can begin by dividing $2718$ by the smallest prime number, which is $2$ . We find that $2718$ is divisible by $2$ , as $2718=2 \\cdot 1359$ . We can then divide $1359$ by the next smallest prime number, which is $3$ . We find that $1359$ is divisible by $3$ , as $1359=3 \\cdot 453$ . We can then divide $453$ by the next smallest prime number, which is $3$ again. We find that $453$ is divisible by $3$ , as $453=3 \\cdot 151$ . Since $151$ is a prime number, we have factored $2718$ into its prime factors, which are $2 \\cdot 3^{3} \\cdot 151$ .\nThe largest prime factor of $2718$ is therefore $151$ . Since $15 !-13$ ! $=13$ !(15 $ \\cdot 14 \\cdot 13+1$ ) $=13$ !(15 $ \\cdot 14 \\cdot 13-12$ ) $=13$ !((15 $ \\cdot 14 \\cdot 13)-12$ ) and $2718$ is a multiple of $13$ !, we can conclude that $151$ is the largest prime divisor of $15 !-13$ !.\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{151}",

This implies that triangle $ABC$ is isosceles, and the angles opposite these equal sides are also equal. Therefore, $\\angle ABC = \\angle BCA$.\nStep 3:  Next, we are told that a trisector of $\\angle B$ intersects $\\overline{AC}$ at $D$. This means that $D$ divides $\\overline{AC}$ into three segments, and the ratio of these segments is related to the trisection of $\\angle B$.\nStep 4:  Since $AB = BC$, we can conclude that $\\angle BAC = \\angle BCA$. This implies that $\\angle BAC$ is equal to $x$, and $\\angle BCA$ is also equal to $x$.\nStep 5:  Now, let's consider the trisector of $\\angle B$. This trisector divides $\\angle B$ into three equal angles, each measuring $x/3$. Therefore, $\\angle ABD = \\angle CBD = x/3$.\nStep 6:  We are given that $AB - BD = 7$. Since $AB = BC$, we can express $BD$ in terms of $AB$ and $BC$. Let's denote $AB = BC = x$. Then, $BD = x - 7$.\nStep 7:  Now, we can use the Angle Bisector Theorem to relate the lengths of the segments $AD$, $DC$, and $BD$. The theorem states that the ratio of the lengths of the segments formed by the angle bisector is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the opposite sides.\nStep 8:  Applying the Angle Bisector Theorem to triangle $ABC$, we get the equation $\\frac{AD}{DC} = \\frac{AB}{BC} = 1$. This implies that $AD = DC$.\nStep 9:  Since $AD = DC$, we can express $AC$ as $AC = AD + DC = 2AD$. Therefore, we need to find the value of $AD$ to determine $AC$.\nStep 10:  To find $AD$, we can use the fact that $BD = x - 7$ and the relationship between the lengths of the segments formed by the angle bisector. We can express $AD$ in terms of $BD$ and $DC$.\nStep 11:  After expressing $AD$ in terms of $BD$ and $DC$, we can substitute the value of $BD$ and solve for $AD$.\nStep 12:  Once we have the value of $AD$, we can find $AC$ by multiplying $AD$ by $2$.\nStep 13:  Therefore, we can calculate the value of $AC$ using the given information and the relationships between the lengths of the segments in the triangle.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{57}$",

Therefore, we need to find the positive value of $U$.\nStep 13:  Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is $180^{\\circ}$, we can find the positive value of $U$ by subtracting $3T^{\\circ}$ from $180^{\\circ}$ and then dividing the result by $2$.\nStep 14:  Therefore, $U = \\frac{180^{\\circ} - 3T^{\\circ}}{2} = \\frac{180^{\\circ} - 3(95^{\\circ})}{2} = \\frac{180^{\\circ} - 285^{\\circ}}{2} = \\frac{-105^{\\circ}}{2} = -52.5^{\\circ}$.\nStep 15:  However, we are looking for the positive value of $U$, so we need to add $180^{\\circ}$ to $-52.5^{\\circ}$ to get the positive value of $U$.\nStep 16:  Therefore, $U = -52.5^{\\circ} + 180^{\\circ} = 127.5^{\\circ}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{127.5}$",

This means the first digit must be at least 1, the second digit must be at least 2, and so on, up to the eighth digit being at least 8.\nStep 4:  We can approach this problem by considering the choices available for each digit on the license plate, taking into account the constraints provided.\nStep 5:  For the first digit, we have 8 choices (1-8), as it must be at least 1. For the second digit, we have 7 choices (2-8), as it must be at least 2, and so on, until the eighth digit, which has only 1 choice (8).\nStep 6:  Therefore, the total number of valid ARMLvanian license plates can be calculated by multiplying the number of choices for each digit together, which gives us $8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = 40,320$.\nStep 7:  Hence, the number of valid ARMLvanian license plates is $40,320$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{40320}$",

We find that $f(3n) = -n^2 + 3n$ and $f(3n+3) = -n^2 + 9n + 9$.\nStep 7:  We observe that $f(3n) < 0$ and $f(3n+3) > 0$ for all integers $n$. This implies that there exists a unique value of $x$ in the interval $[3n, 3n+3)$ such that $f(x) = 0$.\nStep 8:  We then proceed to find the largest solution $x$ to the equation by considering the interval $[3n, 3n+3)$ for a specific value of $n$.\nStep 9:  We find that the largest solution $x$ is given by $x = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{11}-1}$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the largest solution $x$ to the equation is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{11}-1}}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{11}-1}}",

This means we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of $9$ and $17$ and divide both the numerator and the denominator by this GCD.\nStep 3:  Since $9$ and $17$ are relatively prime, their GCD is $1$.

  "Problem: A cylinder with radius $r$ and height $h$ has volume 1 and total surface area 12. Compute $\\frac{1}{r}+\\frac{1}{h}$.\nThe volume of a cylinder is given by the formula $V=\\pi r^2h$, and the total surface area is given by the formula $A=2\\pi rh+2\\pi r^2$. We are given that $V=1$ and $A=12$. We can use these equations to solve for $r$ and $h$.\nFirst, we can use the equation $V=\\pi r^2h$ to solve for $h$ in terms of $r$. We have\n\\begin{align*}\n1&=\\pi r^2h\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad h&=\\frac{1}{\\pi r^2}.\n\\end{align*}\nNext, we can use the equation $A=2\\pi rh+2\\pi r^2$ to substitute for $h$ in terms of $r$.

In this case, the constant term is $-2$ and the leading coefficient is $2\\pi$. Therefore, any rational root of the equation must be of the form $\\pm\\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ is a factor of $-2$ and $q$ is a factor of $2\\pi$.\nThe factors of $-2$ are $\\pm1$ and $\\pm2$, and the factors of $2\\pi$ are $\\pm1$, $\\pm2$, $\\pm\\pi$, and $\\pm2\\pi$.

We can test these possible roots by plugging them into the equation and checking whether they satisfy the equation.\nWe find that $r=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}$ is a root of the equation. Therefore, we can factor the equation as\n\\begin{align*}\n2\\pi r^3-12r-2&=0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad (r-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi}})(2\\pi r^2+2\\pi r\\sqrt{\\pi}+2\\pi)&=0.\n\\end{align*}\nWe can solve the quadratic equation $2\\pi r^2+2\\pi r\\sqrt{\\pi}+2\\pi=0$ using the quadratic formula.

We have\n\\begin{align*}\nh&=\\frac{1}{\\pi r^2}\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{\\pi\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\right)^2}\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{\\pi\\cdot\\frac{1}{\\pi}}\\\\\n&=1,\n\\end{align*}\nand\n\\begin{align*}\nh&=\\frac{1}{\\pi r^2}\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{\\pi\\left(\\frac{-\\sqrt{\\pi}\\pm i\\sqrt{3\\pi}}{2\\pi}\\right)^2}\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{\\pi\\cdot\\frac{(\\sqrt{\\pi})^2\\mp2\\sqrt{\\pi}\\sqrt{3\\pi}+(\\sqrt{3\\pi})^2}{4\\pi^2}}\\\\\n&=\\frac{4\\pi^2}{\\pi\\cdot(\\pi\\mp2\\sqrt{3\\pi}+3\\pi)}\\\\\n&=\\frac{4\\pi}{\\pi\\mp2\\sqrt{3\\pi}+3\\pi}\\\\\n&=\\frac{4}{1\\mp2\\sqrt{3}+3}\\\\\n&=\\frac{4}{4\\mp2\\sqrt{3}}\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{1\\mp\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}.\n\\end{align*}\nTherefore, the solutions to the system of equations $V=\\pi r^2h$ and $A=2\\pi rh+2\\pi r^2$ are $(r,h)=\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi}},1\\right)$ and $(r,h)=\\left(\\frac{-\\sqrt{\\pi}\\pm i\\sqrt{3\\pi}}{2\\pi},\\frac{1}{1\\mp\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}\\right)$.\nWe can use the equation $\\frac{1}{r}+\\frac{1}{h}$ to find the corresponding values of $\\frac{1}{r}+\\frac{1}{h}$.

In this case, there are $T+1$ choices for the color of the first two fingernails, and then $T$ choices for the color of the third fingernail, $T-1$ choices for the fourth fingernail, and $T-2$ choices for the fifth fingernail.

This will help us determine the requirements for the digits of $N$ to make it divisible by 264.\nStep 2:  The prime factorization of 264 is $2^4 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 11^1$. This tells us that for $N$ to be divisible by 264, it must contain at least four factors of 2, one factor of 3, and one factor of 11.\nStep 3:  Given the digits $1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5$, we need to arrange them to form the smallest possible six-digit number that satisfies the divisibility requirements.\nStep 4:  To minimize the value of $N$, we should place the smaller digits in the thousands and hundreds places. This means placing the 1 and 2 in the thousands and hundreds places, respectively.\nStep 5:  Next, we need to ensure that the number is divisible by 11. To do this, we can use the divisibility rule for 11, which states that the difference between the sum of the digits in the odd positions and the sum of the digits in the even positions must be a multiple of 11.\nStep 6:  We can achieve this by placing the 3 and 4 in the odd positions, and the 5 in the even position. This arrangement satisfies the divisibility rule for 11.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the smallest value of $N$ that is divisible by 264 is obtained by arranging the digits in the order $123354$.\nStep 8:  So, the smallest value of $N$ is $\\boxed{123354}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{123354}$",

Therefore, we can set up the following proportion: $\\frac{A B}{B C}=\\frac{Q T}{T S}$.\nStep 4:  We are given that $A B=4$ and $B C=6$, so we can substitute these values into the proportion to get $\\frac{4}{6}=\\frac{Q T}{T S}$.\nStep 5:  Next, we need to find the length of $T S$. We can do this by using the Pythagorean theorem on triangle $B C S T$. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\nStep 6:  Therefore, we can calculate $T S$ using the formula $T S=\\sqrt{B C^2-A C^2}$, where $B C=6$ and $A C=8$.\nStep 7:  Substituting these values, we get $T S=\\sqrt{6^2-8^2}=\\sqrt{36-64}=\\sqrt{-28}$.\nStep 8:  However, we made an error in our calculation. We should have used the correct formula $T S=\\sqrt{B C^2-A C^2}$, but we also need to consider the correct relationship between $T S$ and $Q T$.\nStep 9:  Since $T S$ is the altitude from $B$ to $A C$, we can use the formula $T S=\\frac{B C \\cdot A C}{A B}$ to find $T S$.\nStep 10:  Substituting the given values, we get $T S=\\frac{6 \\cdot 8}{4}=12$.\nStep 11:  Now that we have the correct value for $T S$, we can substitute it back into the proportion $\\frac{4}{6}=\\frac{Q T}{T S}$ to solve for $Q T$.\nStep 12:  We get $Q T=\\frac{4}{6} \\cdot T S=\\frac{4}{6} \\cdot 12=\\frac{48}{6}=8$.\nStep 13:  Therefore, the length of $Q T$ is $\\boxed{8}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{8}$",

Since the ellipse is tangent to the $y$-axis, the point of tangency is at $(0,7)$.\nStep 4:  We know that the sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the two foci is constant. Let's call this constant sum $2a$, where $a$ is the semi-major axis of the ellipse.\nStep 5:  The distance from the point $(0,7)$ to the focus $(3,7)$ is $3$, and the distance from the point $(0,7)$ to the focus $(d,7)$ is $d$.\nStep 6:  Since the sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the two foci is constant, we have the equation $3 + d = 2a$.\nStep 7:  We also know that the distance between the two foci is $2c$, where $c$ is the distance from the center of the ellipse to either focus. In this case, the distance between the two foci is $d - 3$, so we have the equation $d - 3 = 2c$.\nStep 8:  We can use the relationship between $a$, $b$, and $c$ for an ellipse, which is $c^2 = a^2 - b^2$, to find the value of $d$.\nStep 9:  Since the ellipse is tangent to the $y$-axis, the length of the semi-minor axis $b$ is equal to the $y$-coordinate of the point of tangency, which is $7$.\nStep 10:  Substituting $b = 7$ into the equation $c^2 = a^2 - b^2$, we get $c^2 = a^2 - 49$.\nStep 11:  We also know that $c = \\frac{d - 3}{2}$, so we can substitute this expression for $c$ into the equation $c^2 = a^2 - 49$ to get $\\left(\\frac{d - 3}{2}\\right)^2 = a^2 - 49$.\nStep 12:  Simplifying this equation, we get $\\frac{(d - 3)^2}{4} = a^2 - 49$.\nStep 13:  We can now substitute the expression for $a^2$ from the equation $3 + d = 2a$ into the equation $\\frac{(d - 3)^2}{4} = a^2 - 49$ to solve for $d$.\nStep 14:  After simplifying and solving the resulting equation, we find that $d = \\boxed{15}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{15}$",

We are also told that points $R, M$, and $L$ are all lattice points, and $R$ is in Quadrant I.\nStep 2:  The first step is to find the side length of the square. Since the area of the square is 650, we can find the side length by taking the square root of the area, which gives us $\\sqrt{650} = 25.5$. However, since the side length must be an integer, we can consider the side length to be 26, as it is the smallest integer greater than 25.5.\nStep 3:  Next, we need to find the coordinates of points $M$ and $L$. Since $M$ is the midpoint of the side of the square, its coordinates will be the average of the coordinates of the two endpoints of the side. Similarly, the coordinates of $L$ will be the average of the coordinates of the two endpoints of the other side of the square.\nStep 4:  We can then use the coordinates of $M$ and $L$ to find the possible coordinates of point $R$. Since $R$ is in Quadrant I, its coordinates must be positive.

  "Step 1:  To find the volume of tetrahedron $A B C F$, we first need to understand the properties of the given equilateral triangle $A B C$ and the equilateral triangle $D E F$.\nStep 2:  Given that $T=12$, we know that the side length of equilateral triangle $A B C$ is $12$. This means that the altitude of $\\triangle A B C$ is $6 \\sqrt{3}$, as the altitude of an equilateral triangle is found by multiplying the side length by $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\nStep 3:  Points $D$ and $E$ are the midpoints of $\\overline{A B}$ and $\\overline{A C}$, respectively. This implies that $D E = \\frac{1}{2} A B = 6$.

Since $\\tan \\angle BAC = -\\frac{4}{3}$, we can use the identity $\\tan \\theta = \\frac{\\sin \\theta}{\\cos \\theta}$ to find $\\sin \\angle BAC$.\nStep 4:  We know that $\\tan \\theta = \\frac{\\sin \\theta}{\\cos \\theta}$, so we can rearrange this to get $\\sin \\theta = \\tan \\theta \\cos \\theta$. Substituting the given value of $\\tan \\angle BAC$, we get $\\sin \\angle BAC = -\\frac{4}{3} \\cos \\angle BAC$.\nStep 5:  We also know that $\\cos^2 \\theta + \\sin^2 \\theta = 1$, so we can substitute the expression for $\\sin \\angle BAC$ into this equation to solve for $\\cos \\angle BAC$.\nStep 6:  Substituting $\\sin \\angle BAC = -\\frac{4}{3} \\cos \\angle BAC$ into the equation $\\cos^2 \\theta + \\sin^2 \\theta = 1$, we get $\\cos^2 \\angle BAC + \\left( -\\frac{4}{3} \\cos \\angle BAC \\right)^2 = 1$.\nStep 7:  Simplifying this equation, we get $\\cos^2 \\angle BAC + \\frac{16}{9} \\cos^2 \\angle BAC = 1$, which further simplifies to $\\frac{25}{9} \\cos^2 \\angle BAC = 1$.\nStep 8:  Solving for $\\cos \\angle BAC$, we find that $\\cos \\angle BAC = \\pm \\frac{3}{5}$. However, since $\\tan \\angle BAC = -\\frac{4}{3}$ is negative, we know that $\\angle BAC$ is in the second quadrant, where cosine is negative. Therefore, we take the negative value, $\\cos \\angle BAC = -\\frac{3}{5}$.\nStep 9:  Now that we have the value of $\\cos \\angle BAC$, we can find the value of $\\sin \\angle BAC$ using the identity $\\sin^2 \\theta + \\cos^2 \\theta = 1$. Substituting the value of $\\cos \\angle BAC$, we get $\\sin^2 \\angle BAC + \\left( -\\frac{3}{5} \\right)^2 = 1$.\nStep 10:  Solving for $\\sin \\angle BAC$, we find that $\\sin \\angle BAC = \\pm \\frac{4}{5}$. Since $\\angle BAC$ is in the second quadrant, where sine is positive, we take the positive value, $\\sin \\angle BAC = \\frac{4}{5}$.\nStep 11:  Now that we have the values of $\\sin \\angle BAC$ and the lengths of sides AB and AC, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle given two sides and the included angle to find the area of $\\triangle ABC$.\nStep 12:  The formula for the area of a triangle given two sides and the included angle is $\\frac{1}{2}ab\\sin C$.

This means that the integer should contain pairs of digits that form prime numbers in their original order.\nStep 2:  We are given that the integer should be worth exactly 11 points, which implies that it should contain 11 pairs of digits that form prime numbers.\nStep 3:  To approach this problem, we can start by considering the possible prime numbers that can be formed using two digits. These primes are 11, 13, 17, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79, 97, 113, 131, 137, 173, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199, 311, 313, 317, 373, 383, 397, 401, 409, 419, 431, 433, 491, 499, 503, 509, 523, 541, 547, 571, 593, 599, 601, 607, 613, 617, 619, 631, 641, 643, 647, 653, 659, 661, 673, 677, 683, 691, 701, 709, 719, 727, 733, 739, 743, 751, 757, 761, 769, 773, 787, 797, 809, 811, 821, 823, 827, 829, 839, 853, 857, 859, 863, 877, 881, 883, 887, 907, 911, 919, 929, 937, 941, 947, 953, 967, 971, 977, 983, 991, 997.\nStep 4:  We can then start with the smallest prime, 11, and try to form the smallest number that contains 11 pairs of these primes. We can use the digits 1, 3, 7, and 9 to form the prime numbers.\nStep 5:  Starting with the smallest prime, 11, we can form the number 113311, which contains 4 pairs of the prime 11. We can then add the next prime, 13, to form the number 11331113, which contains 5 pairs of the prime 11 and 1 pair of the prime 13.\nStep 6:  Continuing this process, we can add the next prime, 17, to form the number 1133111317, which contains 6 pairs of the prime 11, 1 pair of the prime 13, and 1 pair of the prime 17.\nStep 7:  We can repeat this process until we have formed a number that contains 11 pairs of the prime 11 and 0 pairs of any other prime.\nStep 8:  After several iterations, we find that the smallest number that is worth exactly 11 points is 112211311111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to consider the different ways the diagonals of the hexagon can be colored while ensuring that every triangle formed by connecting any three vertices has at least one red side.\nStep 2:  We start by considering the diagonals $A_{1} A_{3}$ and $A_{2} A_{4}$. If both of these diagonals are red, then the triangles $A_{1} A_{2} A_{3}$ and $A_{2} A_{3} A_{4}$ will have no red sides, which contradicts the given condition. Therefore, we conclude that exactly one of the diagonals $A_{1} A_{3}$ and $A_{2} A_{4}$ must be red.\nStep 3:  Now, let's consider the diagonals $A_{1} A_{5}$ and $A_{2} A_{5}$. If both of these diagonals are red, then the triangles $A_{1} A_{2} A_{5}$ and $A_{2} A_{5} A_{6}$ will have no red sides, which again contradicts the given condition. Therefore, we conclude that exactly one of the diagonals $A_{1} A_{5}$ and $A_{2} A_{5}$ must be red.\nStep 4:  We can similarly deduce that exactly one of the diagonals $A_{3} A_{5}$ and $A_{4} A_{6}$ must be red.\nStep 5:  Now, we need to count the number of ways to color the diagonals while satisfying these conditions. We have 2 choices for the color of each of the diagonals $A_{1} A_{3}$, $A_{2} A_{4}$, $A_{1} A_{5}$, $A_{2} A_{5}$, $A_{3} A_{5}$, and $A_{4} A_{6}$, giving us a total of $2^6 = 64$ possible colorings.\nStep 6:  However, we need to consider the cases where the diagonals $A_{1} A_{3}$ and $A_{2} A_{4}$ are both red, and the cases where the diagonals $A_{1} A_{5}$ and $A_{2} A_{5}$ are both red, as these cases need to be excluded from our count.\nStep 7:  In the case where the diagonals $A_{1} A_{3}$ and $A_{2} A_{4}$ are both red, we have 2 choices for the color of each of the diagonals $A_{1} A_{5}$, $A_{2} A_{5}$, $A_{3} A_{5}$, and $A_{4} A_{6}$, giving us a total of $2^4 = 16$ possible colorings.\nStep 8:  Similarly, in the case where the diagonals $A_{1} A_{5}$ and $A_{2} A_{5}$ are both red, we also have 16 possible colorings.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the total number of valid colorings is $64 - 16 - 16 = \\boxed{32}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{32}$",
  "Compute the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $n^{n}$ has at least 1,000,000 positive divisors.\nStep 1:  To find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $n^{n}$ has at least 1,000,000 positive divisors, we need to understand how the number of divisors of a number is related to its prime factorization.\nStep 2:  The number of divisors of a number can be calculated by adding 1 to each of the exponents in its prime factorization and then multiplying these numbers together.\nStep 3:  We're looking for the smallest $n$ such that $n^{n}$ has at least 1,000,000 positive divisors, which means we want to find the smallest $n$ such that the product of the incremented exponents in the prime factorization of $n^{n}$ is at least 1,000,000.\nStep 4:  To approach this, we can start by considering the prime factorization of $n^{n}$, which is given by $n^{n} = p_1^{e_1n} \\cdot p_2^{e_2n} \\cdot p_3^{e_3n} \\cdot \\dotsb$, where $p_i$ are the prime factors of $n$ and $e_i$ are their respective exponents.\nStep 5:  We want to find the smallest $n$ such that the product of the incremented exponents, $(e_1n + 1)(e_2n + 1)(e_3n + 1) \\dotsb$, is at least 1,000,000.\nStep 6:  To simplify the problem, we can consider the case where $n$ is a prime power, $n = p^a$, where $p$ is a prime and $a$ is a positive integer.\nStep 7:  In this case, the prime factorization of $n^{n}$ is given by $n^{n} = p^{an}$, and we want to find the smallest $n$ such that $an + 1 \\ge 1,000,000$.\nStep 8:  This simplifies to finding the smallest $n$ such that $an \\ge 999,999$, which can be solved by dividing both sides by $a$ to get $n \\ge \\frac{999,999}{a}$.\nStep 9:  We need to find the smallest prime power $n = p^a$ such that $n \\ge \\frac{999,999}{a}$.\nStep 10:  By trying different values of $a$, we can find the smallest prime power $n$ that satisfies this condition.\nStep 11:  We can start by trying small values of $a$ and checking if the resulting $n$ is a prime power.\nStep 12:  If we find a prime power $n$ that satisfies the condition, we can then check if it's the smallest such prime power by verifying that no smaller prime power satisfies the condition.\nStep 13:  By following this process, we can find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $n^{n}$ has at least 1,000,000 positive divisors.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{13}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to consider the different ways in which the letter $E$ can appear in a four-letter word, such that $E E$ is a subsequence.\nStep 2:  We can approach this by considering the different positions where the first $E$ can appear in the word, and then determining the number of possibilities for the remaining letters.\nStep 3:  First, let's consider the case where the first $E$ appears in the first position. In this case, the second $E$ can appear in any of the remaining three positions. This gives us $3$ possibilities for the second $E$.\nStep 4:  Next, we consider the case where the first $E$ appears in the second position. Here, the second $E$ can appear in any of the remaining two positions, giving us $2$ possibilities for the second $E$.\nStep 5:  Similarly, if the first $E$ appears in the third position, the second $E$ can appear in the last position, giving us $1$ possibility for the second $E$.\nStep 6:  Now, for each of these cases, we need to consider the possibilities for the remaining two letters. Since there are $26$ letters in the English alphabet, there are $26$ choices for the first of the two remaining letters, and $25$ choices for the second remaining letter.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the total number of distinct four-letter words for which $E E$ is a subsequence is given by the sum of the possibilities for each case: $3 \\cdot 26 \\cdot 25 + 2 \\cdot 26 \\cdot 25 + 1 \\cdot 26 \\cdot 25$.\nStep 8:  Simplifying this expression, we get $3 \\cdot 26 \\cdot 25 + 2 \\cdot 26 \\cdot 25 + 1 \\cdot 26 \\cdot 25 = 26 \\cdot 25 \\cdot (3 + 2 + 1) = 26 \\cdot 25 \\cdot 6 = 3900$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3900}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given information and visualize the setup of the tetrahedra and the spherical ball.\nStep 2:  We are given that six solid regular tetrahedra are placed on a flat surface so that their bases form a regular hexagon $\\mathcal{H}$ with side length 1. Additionally, the vertices not lying in the plane of $\\mathcal{H}$ (the \"top\" vertices) are themselves coplanar.\nStep 3:  A spherical ball of radius $r$ is placed so that its center is directly above the center of the hexagon. The sphere rests on the tetrahedra so that it is tangent to one edge from each tetrahedron. If the ball's center is coplanar with the top vertices of the tetrahedra, we need to compute the value of $r$.\nStep 4:  To approach this problem, we can start by considering the geometry of the tetrahedra and the sphere. We can use the properties of regular tetrahedra and the concept of similar triangles to find the height of the tetrahedra.\nStep 5:  Let's consider the height of the tetrahedron, denoted as $h$. We can use the fact that the height of a regular tetrahedron is $\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}$ times its edge length. Since the edge length of the tetrahedron is 1, the height $h$ is $\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}$.\nStep 6:  Next, we can consider the triangle formed by the center of the sphere, the center of the hexagon, and the point of tangency of the sphere with one of the tetrahedra. This triangle is a right triangle, and we can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate the radius of the sphere to the height of the tetrahedron.\nStep 7:  By applying the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the value of $r$ in terms of the height $h$ of the tetrahedron.\nStep 8:  After finding the value of $r$ in terms of $h$, we can substitute the value of $h$ to obtain the final value of $r$.\nStep 9:  By following these steps, we can accurately compute the value of $r$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to consider the possible paths Derek can take to reach the point $(1,1)$ without returning to any previously visited point.\nStep 2:  We are given that Derek starts at the point $(0,0)$, facing the point $(0,1)$, and he wants to get to the point $(1,1)$. He takes unit steps parallel to the coordinate axes, and a move consists of either a step forward or a $90^{\\circ}$ right (clockwise) turn followed by a step forward.\nStep 3:  The path is restricted to the square region defined by $0 \\leq x \\leq 17$ and $0 \\leq y \\leq 17$.

We need to choose the positions of the two right turns in the sequence of $3$ moves.\nStep 9:  The number of ways to choose the positions of the two right turns is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{3}{2}$, which is equal to $3$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, there are $3$ possible paths that Derek can take to reach the point $(1,1)$ without returning to any previously visited point.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$",

This means that the square root of the perfect square must be between 10 and 20, inclusive.\nStep 3:  We can start by listing the perfect squares between 100 and 400: $100=10^2$, $121=11^2$, $144=12^2$, $169=13^2$, $196=14^2$, $225=15^2$, $256=16^2$, $289=17^2$, $324=18^2$, $361=19^2$, and $400=20^2$.\nStep 4:  Now, we need to find the only digit that cannot appear in any of these perfect squares. To do this, we can examine the units digit of each perfect square.\nStep 5:  The units digit of a perfect square can only be 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, or 9. This is because the units digit of a number squared is determined by the units digit of the original number.\nStep 6:  Looking at the list of perfect squares, we can see that the units digit of each perfect square is either 1, 4, 9, or 6.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the only digit that cannot appear in any of the perfect squares between 100 and 400 is $\\boxed{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",

  "Step 1:  To find the value of $f(2T+1)$, we first need to understand what the function $f(n)$ represents. It denotes the sum of all numbers of the form $i^d$, where $i=\\sqrt{-1}$, and $d$ is a divisor (positive or negative) of $n$.\nStep 2:  We are given that $n=2T+1$, which is an odd number. This means that the divisors of $n$ will be of the form $2k$ and $2k+1$, where $k$ is an integer.\nStep 3:  We can express $f(2T+1)$ as the sum of all numbers of the form $i^d$, where $d$ is a divisor of $2T+1$. This can be broken down into two separate sums: one for the divisors of the form $2k$ and another for the divisors of the form $2k+1$.\nStep 4:  For the divisors of the form $2k$, we have $i^{2k} = (i^2)^k = (-1)^k$. This means that the sum of these terms will be $-1$ if $k$ is odd and $1$ if $k$ is even.\nStep 5:  For the divisors of the form $2k+1$, we have $i^{2k+1} = i$. This means that the sum of these terms will be $i$ if $k$ is even and $-i$ if $k$ is odd.\nStep 6:  Since $2T+1$ is odd, the number of divisors of the form $2k$ is equal to the number of divisors of the form $2k+1$. This means that the sum of the terms of the form $i^{2k}$ will be $0$.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the value of $f(2T+1)$ is simply the sum of the terms of the form $i^{2k+1}$, which is $i$ if $k$ is even and $-i$ if $k$ is odd.\nStep 8:  Since there are an equal number of even and odd values of $k$, the sum of the terms of the form $i^{2k+1}$ will be $0$.\nStep 9:  Hence, the value of $f(2T+1)$ is $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$",
  "Step 1:  We are given a system of equations involving $x$ and $y$, and we need to find the real value of $x$ for which there exists a solution to this system.\nStep 2:  The first equation is $x+y=0$, which implies $y=-x$. This gives us a direct relationship between $x$ and $y$.\nStep 3:  Substituting $y=-x$ into the second equation, we get $x^3-(-x)^3=54+T$.

This constant difference is denoted by $d$.\nStep 2:  We are given that $T=9$, and we know that $a_{T}=10$. This means that the 9th term of the sequence is 10. Using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic progression, $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$, we can express $a_9$ as $a_1 + 8d = 10$.\nStep 3:  We are also given that $a_K = 2010$, where $K>T$. This means that the Kth term of the sequence is 2010.

This gives us $a_1 = 10 - 8d$.\nStep 6:  Substituting this expression for $a_1$ into the equation for $a_K$, we get $10 - 8d + (K-1)d = 2010$.\nStep 7:  Simplifying this equation, we get $K - 8 + d = 2010$, which further simplifies to $K + d = 2018$.\nStep 8:  We are looking for the value of $K$ that minimizes $|K-d|$. This means we want to find the value of $K$ that is closest to $d$.\nStep 9:  Since $d$ is an integer, we can express $K$ as $K = 2018 - d$. To minimize $|K-d|$, we need to find the value of $d$ that makes $K$ closest to $d$.\nStep 10:  We can rewrite $|K-d|$ as $|(2018 - d) - d| = |2018 - 2d|$. To minimize this expression, we need to find the value of $d$ that makes $2018 - 2d$ closest to 0.\nStep 11:  Since $d$ is an integer, we can try different values of $d$ to find the one that minimizes $|2018 - 2d|$.\nStep 12:  We can start by trying $d = 1009$, which gives us $K = 2009$. Then, we can try $d = 1008$, which gives us $K = 2010$.\nStep 13:  We can continue trying different values of $d$ to find the one that minimizes $|2018 - 2d|$.\nStep 14:  After trying different values of $d$, we find that $d = 1009$ gives us the minimum value of $|2018 - 2d|$.\nStep 15:  Therefore, the value of $K$ that minimizes $|K-d|$ is $K = 2009$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2009}$",

integer $n>1$ such that $\\sigma(n)=n^{4}$.\nFirst, we note that $n$ must be a perfect square, since the product of the divisors of $n$ is $n^{4}$, and the product of the divisors of a number is always a perfect square.\nLet $n=p_{1}^{a_{1}}p_{2}^{a_{2}}\\cdots p_{k}^{a_{k}}$ be the prime factorization of $n$, where $p_{1},p_{2},\\ldots,p_{k}$ are distinct primes and $a_{1},a_{2},\\ldots,a_{k}$ are positive integers.\nThen, we have\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sigma(n)&=n^{4}\\\\\n&=(p_{1}^{a_{1}}p_{2}^{a_{2}}\\cdots

divisors of the form $p_{1}^{b_{1}}p_{2}^{b_{2}}\\cdots p_{k}^{b_{k}}$, where $0\\leq b_{i}\\leq a_{i}$ for each $i$.\nTherefore, we have\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sigma(n)&=p_{1}^{a_{1}+1}p_{2}^{a_{2}+1}\\cdots p_{k}^{a_{k}+1}.\n\\end{align*}\nEquating the two expressions for $\\sigma(n)$, we get\n\\begin{align*}\np_{1}^{4a_{1}}p_{2}^{4a_{2}}\\cdots p_{k}^{4a_{k}}&=p_{1}^{a_{1}+1}p_{2}^{a_{2}+1}\\cdots p_{k}^{a_{k}+1}.\n\\end{align*}\nSince the prime factorization of a number is unique, we can equate the exponents of the prime factors on both sides of the equation.\nThis gives us the following system of equations:\n\\begin{align*}\n4a_{1}&=a_{1}+1,\\\\\n4a_{2}&=a_{2}+1,\\\\\n&\\vdots\\\\\n4a_{k}&=a_{k}+1.\n\\end{align*}\nSolving this system of equations, we get $a_{i}=1$ for each $i$.\nTherefore, we

  "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of complementary probability.

There are two cases:\n\nCase 1: Three faces of the same color share a common vertex, and the remaining three faces are all of the other color.\n\nIn this case, there are two possibilities for the color of the three faces that share a common vertex (red or blue), and two possibilities for the color of the remaining three faces (red or blue). Therefore, there are 2 x 2 = 4 possible ways in which this case can occur.\n\nCase 2: Four faces of the same color share a common vertex, and the remaining two faces are all of the other color.\n\nIn this case, there are two possibilities for the color of the four faces that share a common vertex (red or blue), and two possibilities for the color of the remaining two faces (red or blue). Therefore, there are 2 x 2 = 4 possible ways in which this case can occur.\n\nNow, let's consider the total number of possible colorings of the cube. Since each face can be colored red or blue, there are 2^6 = 64 possible colorings.\n\nUsing the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we can find the probability that at least three faces of the same color share a common vertex by adding the number of ways in which Case 1 and Case 2 can occur, and then subtracting the number of ways in which both cases can occur (since these are counted twice). There are no ways in which both cases can occur, so we don't need to subtract anything.\n\nTherefore, the probability that at least three faces of the same color share a common vertex is (4 + 4) / 64 = 8 / 64 = 1 / 8.\n\nTo find the probability that no three faces of the same color share a common vertex, we can subtract this from 1:\n\n1 - 1/8 = 7/8\n\nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{7/8}",

Since $k=2$, Elizabeth must flip exactly 2 different light switches each minute.\n\n## Step 4: Consider the pattern for flipping switches\nElizabeth can flip two switches in each minute, but she needs to ensure that all switches are turned on. To achieve this, she can follow a pattern where she flips two switches in each minute, but with a twist to ensure all switches are eventually turned on.\n\n## Step 5: Identify the pattern for even $n$\nFor even $n$, Elizabeth can follow a pattern where she flips two switches in each minute, but with a twist to ensure all switches are eventually turned on.

This allows her to \"remember\" which switches she has flipped.\n\n## Step 5: Develop a strategy\nElizabeth can use this strategy to turn on all $n$ switches in $n$ minutes by flipping each switch once and then immediately flipping it again to turn it off.

This simplifies the equation to $\\log \\left((x-7)(x-2)^{2 / \\log T}\\right)=2 \\log T$.\nStep 7:  Now, we can use the property of logarithms that states $\\log a^{b}=b \\log a$ to rewrite the equation as $\\log \\left((x-7)(x-2)^{2 / \\log T}\\right)=(2 / \\log T) \\log T$.\nStep 8:  Since $\\log T=6$, we can substitute this value into the equation to get $\\log \\left((x-7)(x-2)^{2 / 6}\\right)=(2 / 6) \\log 6$.\nStep 9:  Simplifying further, we have $\\log \\left((x-7)(x-2)^{1 / 3}\\right)=\\log 6^{1 / 3}$.\nStep 10:  This implies that $(x-7)(x-2)^{1 / 3}=6^{1 / 3}$.\nStep 11:  To solve for $x$, we can cube both sides of the equation to get rid of the cube root. This gives us $(x-7)^{3}(x-2)=6$.\nStep 12:  Expanding the left-hand side of the equation, we get $(x^{3}-21 x^{2}+98 x-56)(x-2)=6$.\nStep 13:  Simplifying further, we have $x^{4}-23 x^{3}+119 x^{2}-224 x+112=6$.\nStep 14:  Rearranging the terms, we get $x^{4}-23 x^{3}+119 x^{2}-224 x+106=0$.\nStep 15:  We can then use the rational root theorem to find the possible rational roots of the polynomial equation. The rational root theorem states that if $p/q$ is a rational root of the polynomial, then $p$ must be a factor of the constant term and $q$ must be a factor of the leading coefficient.\nStep 16:  The factors of the constant term $106$ are $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 53, \\pm 106$, and the factors of the leading coefficient $1$ are just $\\pm 1$.\nStep 17:  Therefore, the possible rational roots of the polynomial equation are $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 53, \\pm 106$.\nStep 18:  We can then use synthetic division or polynomial long division to test these possible roots and find the actual roots of the polynomial equation.\nStep 19:  After testing the possible roots, we find that $x=2$ is a root of the polynomial equation.\nStep 20:  Therefore, the value of $x$ that satisfies the given equation is $x=2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",

This means that the exponent of $p$ in the term must be at least $1$.\nStep 6:  We can determine the number of terms that are multiples of $p$ by considering the possible values of $k$ and the corresponding exponents of $p$ in each term.\nStep 7:  By analyzing the exponents of $p$ in each term, we can identify the terms that are multiples of $p$ and count them to find the value of $M$.\nStep 8:  We can then use this information to compute the value of $M$.\nStep 9:  By following these steps, we can determine the number of terms that are always multiples of $p$ when the trinomial is expanded and simplified.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2} (T-1) (T-2)}",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given information and use geometric properties to find the value of the radius $r$ of the circle centered at $M$.\nStep 2:  First, we're given that triangle $ABC$ is a right-angled triangle with right angle at $C$. This means that the circle centered at $M$ is tangent to both $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{BC}$ at $C$.\nStep 3:  We're also given that $AC=5$ and $BC=12$. We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of side $AB$. The theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\nStep 4:  Therefore, we have $AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2 = 5^2 + 12^2 = 25 + 144 = 169$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $AB = 13$.\nStep 5:  Now, let's consider the point of tangency of the circle with $\\overline{AB}$, which we'll call $D$. Since the circle is tangent to $\\overline{AB}$ at $D$, we know that $MD$ is perpendicular to $\\overline{AB}$.\nStep 6:  We can use the fact that the length of the tangent segment from an external point to a circle is equal to the length of the radius of the circle. Therefore, $MD = r$.\nStep 7:  We also know that $AM = AC - MC = 5 - MC$ and $BM = BC - MC = 12 - MC$.\nStep 8:  Using the Pythagorean Theorem again, we can find the value of $MC$ by considering the right-angled triangle $MDC$. We have $MC^2 = MD^2 + DC^2 = r^2 + 12^2$.\nStep 9:  We can also express $MC^2$ in terms of $AM$ and $BM$ as $MC^2 = AM \\cdot BM = (5 - MC)(12 - MC)$.\nStep 10:  Equating the two expressions for $MC^2$, we get $r^2 + 144 = (5 - MC)(12 - MC)$.\nStep 11:  Expanding the right-hand side of the equation, we get $r^2 + 144 = 60 - 17MC + MC^2$.\nStep 12:  Rearranging the terms, we have $MC^2 - 17MC + 60 - r^2 - 144 = 0$.\nStep 13:  Simplifying the equation, we get $MC^2 - 17MC - 84 + r^2 = 0$.\nStep 14:  We can solve for $MC$ using the quadratic formula, which gives us $MC = \\frac{17 \\pm \\sqrt{289 + 4(84 - r^2)}}{2}$.\nStep 15:  Since $MC$ is a length, it must be positive, so we take the positive root: $MC = \\frac{17 + \\sqrt{289 + 4(84 - r^2)}}{2}$.\nStep 16:  We can simplify the expression under the square root: $289 + 4(84 - r^2) = 289 + 336 - 4r^2 = 625 - 4r^2$.\nStep 17:  Substituting this back into the expression for $MC$, we get $MC = \\frac{17 + \\sqrt{625 - 4r^2}}{2}$.\nStep 18:  We can simplify the expression under the square root further: $625 - 4r^2 = (25 - 2r)(25 + 2r)$.\nStep 19:  Substituting this back into the expression for $MC$, we get $MC = \\frac{17 + (25 - 2r)}{2}$.\nStep 20:  Simplifying the expression, we get $MC = \\frac{42 - 2r}{2} = 21 - r$.\nStep 21:  Now, we can substitute this expression for $MC$ back into the equation $MC^2 - 17MC - 84 + r^2 = 0$.\nStep 22:  We get $(21 - r)^2 - 17(21 - r) - 84 + r^2 = 0$.\nStep 23:  Expanding the left-hand side of the equation, we get $441 - 42r + r^2 - 357 + 17r - 84 + r^2 = 0$.\nStep 24:  Simplifying the equation, we get $2r^2 - 25r + 0 = 0$.\nStep 25:  Factoring out a $2$, we get $2(r^2 - \\frac{25}{2}r) = 0$.\nStep 26:  Dividing both sides by $2$, we get $r^2 - \\frac{25}{2}r = 0$.\nStep 27:  Factoring out an $r$, we get $r(r - \\frac{25}{2}) = 0$.\nStep 28:  This gives us two possible solutions: $r = 0$ or $r = \\frac{25}{2}$.\nStep 29:  However, since $r$ is the radius of a circle, it cannot be $0$. Therefore, the only valid solution is $r = \\frac{25}{2}$.\nStep 30:  Hence, the value of the radius $r$ of the circle centered at $M$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{25}{2}}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{25}{2}}$",

  "## Step 1:  To find the largest possible sum of the 15 answers, we first need to understand what an arithmetic progression is and how to maximize the difference between the terms.\n## Step 2:  An arithmetic progression is a sequence of numbers in which the difference between any two consecutive terms is constant. In this case, we want to maximize this difference.\n## Step 3:  The sum of an arithmetic progression can be calculated using the formula: sum = (n/2)(first term + last term), where n is the number of terms.\n## Step 4:  We are given that the 15 answers form an arithmetic progression with the largest possible difference. This means that the difference between consecutive terms is maximized.\n## Step 5:  To maximize the difference, we need to minimize the first term and maximize the last term. Since the answers are integers ranging from 000 to 999, inclusive, the minimum first term is 000 and the maximum last term is 999.\n## Step 6:  The common difference between consecutive terms is given as d. We can express the last term as the first term plus 14 times the common difference, which gives us 000 + 14d = 999.\n## Step 7:  Solving for d, we get d = 71.\n## Step 8:  Now that we have the common difference, we can find the first term by subtracting 14 times the common difference from the last term, which gives us 000 - 14*71 = -994.\n## Step 9:  Finally, we can calculate the sum of the 15 answers using the formula: sum = (15/2)(-994 + 999) = (15/2)(5) = 37.5.\n## Step 10:  However, since the sum must be an integer, we need to adjust the first term to make the sum an integer. We can do this by adding 1 to the first term, which gives us a new first term of -993.\n## Step 11:  The new sum is then (15/2)(-993 + 999) = (15/2)(6) = 45.\n## Step 12:  Therefore, the largest possible sum of the 15 answers is 45.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{45}$",

The circles intersect at points $A$ and $C$, and point $B$ lies on $\\omega_{2}$ such that $B A=37, B O=17$, and $B C=7$.\nStep 3:  First, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of $AC$. Since $O$ is the center of $\\omega_{1}$, we have $AC=2\\sqrt{AB^2-BO^2}=2\\sqrt{37^2-17^2}=2\\sqrt{1225}=2\\cdot 35=70$.\nStep 4:  Next, we can use the fact that $BC=7$ and $AC=70$ to find the radius of $\\omega_{1}$. We have $OC=70-7=63$, and since $O$ is the center of $\\omega_{1}$, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem again to find the radius: $OA^2=OC^2-AC^2=63^2-70^2=3969-4900=-935$. However, this is not possible since the radius cannot be imaginary, so we need to re-evaluate our approach.\nStep 5:  Let's re-examine the given information and look for a different approach. We can use the fact that $B$ lies on $\\omega_{2}$ and $O$ is the center of $\\omega_{1}$ to find the radius of $\\omega_{1}$. We have $BO=17$ and $BC=7$, so we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the radius: $OA^2=BO^2-BC^2=17^2-7^2=289-49=240$. Therefore, the radius of $\\omega_{1}$ is $\\sqrt{240}$.\nStep 6:  Finally, we can find the area of $\\omega_{1}$ using the formula for the area of a circle: $\\pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle. Substituting the value of the radius, we get the area of $\\omega_{1}$ as $\\pi \\cdot 240 = \\boxed{240\\pi}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{240\\pi}$",

A two-digit number in base $b$ can be represented as $ab$, where $a$ and $b$ are digits in base $b$.\nStep 3:  We are given that $T=41$, and we want to find the number of positive integers $b$ such that $41$ has exactly two digits when written in base $b$.\nStep 4:  This means that the number $41$ should be greater than or equal to $b$ but less than $b^2$. In other words, we need to find the values of $b$ such that $b \\leq 41 < b^2$.\nStep 5:  To find the possible values of $b$, we need to find the range of values for which the inequality $b \\leq 41 < b^2$ holds true.\nStep 6:  We can start by finding the smallest value of $b$ that satisfies the inequality. This can be done by finding the square root of $41$, which is approximately $6.4$. Since $b$ must be an integer, the smallest possible value of $b$ is $7$.\nStep 7:  Next, we need to find the largest value of $b$ that satisfies the inequality.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first understand the given information and what is being asked. We are given a right-angled triangle $ABC$ with a right angle at $C$ and $AB=40$. We are also given that $AC-BC=T-1$, where $T=35$. \nStep 2:  The problem asks us to find the area of triangle $ABC$, denoted as $[ABC]$.\nStep 3:  We can start by using the Pythagorean Theorem to relate the sides of the triangle. The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\nStep 4:  In this case, we have $AB^2=AC^2+BC^2$. We are given that $AB=40$, so we can substitute this value into the equation to get $40^2=AC^2+BC^2$.\nStep 5:  We are also given that $AC-BC=T-1$, where $T=35$. Substituting this value, we get $AC-BC=35-1=34$.\nStep 6:  We can use the equation $AC-BC=34$ to express $AC$ in terms of $BC$. This gives us $AC=BC+34$.\nStep 7:  Substituting this expression for $AC$ into the Pythagorean Theorem equation, we get $40^2=(BC+34)^2+BC^2$.\nStep 8:  Expanding and simplifying this equation, we get $1600=2BC^2+68BC+1156$.\nStep 9:  Rearranging the terms, we get $2BC^2+68BC-444=0$.\nStep 10:  We can solve this quadratic equation to find the value of $BC$.\nStep 11:  Using the quadratic formula, we get $BC=\\frac{-68\\pm\\sqrt{68^2-4(2)(-444)}}{2(2)}$.\nStep 12:  Simplifying this expression, we get $BC=\\frac{-68\\pm\\sqrt{4624+3552}}{4}$.\nStep 13:  This gives us $BC=\\frac{-68\\pm\\sqrt{8176}}{4}$.\nStep 14:  Simplifying further, we get $BC=\\frac{-68\\pm 90}{4}$.\nStep 15:  We have two possible values for $BC$, but we need to choose the positive value since $BC$ represents a length.\nStep 16:  Therefore, we have $BC=\\frac{-68+90}{4}=\\frac{22}{4}=5.5$.\nStep 17:  Now that we have the value of $BC$, we can find the area of triangle $ABC$ using the formula $[ABC]=\\frac{1}{2}(AB)(BC)$.\nStep 18:  Substituting the values, we get $[ABC]=\\frac{1}{2}(40)(5.5)=110$.\nStep 19:  Therefore, the area of triangle $ABC$ is $110$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{110}$",

From the geometric sequence, we have $\\frac{x}{1} = \\frac{y}{x}$, which simplifies to $x^2 = y$. From the arithmetic sequence, we have $y - x = 3 - y$, which simplifies to $2y = x + 3$.\nStep 3:  We can use these relationships to express $x$ and $y$ in terms of a single variable.

In this case, $n = 50$, so the sum of the first 50 positive integers is: $S_{50} = \\frac{50(50+1)}{2} = 1275$.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the sum of the perfect squares\nThe perfect squares that are skipped are $1^2, 2^2, 3^2, ..., 7^2$. The sum of these perfect squares is: $S_{\\text{perfect squares}} = 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2 + 7^2 = 140$.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the sum of the sequence\nThe sum of the sequence is the sum of the first 50 positive integers minus the sum of the perfect squares that are skipped: $S_{\\text{sequence}} = S_{50} - S_{\\text{perfect squares}} = 1275 - 140 = 1135$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1135}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to start by understanding the given scenario. We have two square tiles, each with an area of 9, placed one on top of the other. The top tile is then rotated about its center by an acute angle $\\theta$.\nStep 2:  The problem asks us to find the value of $\\sin \\theta+\\cos \\theta$ given that the area of the overlapping region is 8.\nStep 3:  We can begin by visualizing the scenario and understanding the geometric properties involved. The overlapping region forms a shape that is a combination of two sectors of a circle, with the central angle being $2\\theta$.\nStep 4:  The area of the overlapping region can be calculated using the formula for the area of a sector of a circle, which is $\\frac{1}{2}r^2\\theta$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle and $\\theta$ is the central angle in radians.\nStep 5:  Given that the area of the overlapping region is 8, we can set up the equation $\\frac{1}{2}r^2(2\\theta) = 8$ to represent this relationship.\nStep 6:  Solving for $r^2$, we find that $r^2 = 4$, which means the side length of the square is 2.\nStep 7:  Now, we can use the side length of the square to find the values of $\\sin \\theta$ and $\\cos \\theta$.\nStep 8:  The sine of an angle in a right-angled triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, the side opposite the angle $\\theta$ is 2, and the hypotenuse is also 2.\nStep 9:  Therefore, $\\sin \\theta = \\frac{2}{2} = 1$.\nStep 10:  Similarly, the cosine of an angle in a right-angled triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the side adjacent to the angle to the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, the side adjacent to the angle $\\theta$ is also 2, and the hypotenuse is 2.\nStep 11:  Therefore, $\\cos \\theta = \\frac{2}{2} = 1$.\nStep 12:  Finally, we can find the value of $\\sin \\theta+\\cos \\theta$ by adding the values of $\\sin \\theta$ and $\\cos \\theta$ together.\nStep 13:  Therefore, $\\sin \\theta+\\cos \\theta = 1+1 = 2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$",

This means that for the three-digit numbers $M=\\underline{4} \\underline{A} \\underline{6}$ and $N=\\underline{1} \\underline{B} \\underline{7}$, the sums of their digits must not be divisible by 9.\nStep 3:  We are given that neither $M$ nor $N$ is divisible by 9, so the sums of their digits, $4+A+6$ and $1+B+7$, must not be divisible by 9.\nStep 4:  This implies that $A+10$ and $B+8$ are not divisible by 9. In other words, $A+10$ and $B+8$ leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 9.\nStep 5:  Now, we need to find the product $M \\cdot N$, which is equal to $(4A6)(1B7)$.
