  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of relative motion and how to calculate the time it takes for Alicia and Beth to meet.\nStep 2:  First, we note that the distance between Cities $A$ and $B$ is $45$ miles. Alicia bikes towards $B$ at a speed of $18$ miles per hour, while Beth bikes towards $A$ at a speed of $12$ miles per hour.\nStep 3:  When they meet, the sum of the distances traveled by Alicia and Beth will be equal to the total distance between the cities, which is $45$ miles.\nStep 4:  Let's denote the time it takes for them to meet as $t$ hours. In this time, Alicia will have traveled a distance of $18t$ miles, and Beth will have traveled a distance of $12t$ miles.\nStep 5:  Since the sum of their distances traveled is equal to the total distance between the cities, we can set up the equation $18t + 12t = 45$ to represent this situation.\nStep 6:  Solving for $t$, we get $30t = 45$, which gives us $t = \\frac{45}{30} = \\frac{3}{2}$ hours.\nStep 7:  Now that we have the time it takes for them to meet, we can calculate the distance traveled by Alicia. The distance traveled by Alicia is given by the product of her speed and the time taken, which is $18 \\times \\frac{3}{2} = 27$ miles.\nStep 8:  Therefore, when they meet, Alicia will be $27$ miles from City $A$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{27}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given equations and use algebraic manipulations to find the values of $x$ and $y$.\nStep 2:  We are given two equations: $y^3=x^2$ and $(y-x)^2=4y^2$. Our goal is to find the value of $x+y$.\nStep 3:  Let's start by examining the second equation, $(y-x)^2=4y^2$. Expanding this, we get $y^2-2xy+x^2=4y^2$.\nStep 4:  Rearranging the terms, we have $x^2-2xy-3y^2=0$. This is a quadratic equation in terms of $x$, and we can solve for $x$ using the quadratic formula.\nStep 5:  The quadratic formula states that for an equation of the form $ax^2+bx+c=0$, the solutions are given by $x=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$.\nStep 6:  Applying this to our equation $x^2-2xy-3y^2=0$, we get $x=\\frac{2y\\pm\\sqrt{4y^2+12y^2}}{2}$. Simplifying further, we have $x=\\frac{2y\\pm\\sqrt{16y^2}}{2}$, which reduces to $x=\\frac{2y\\pm4y}{2}$.\nStep 7:  This gives us two possible values for $x$: $x=3y$ or $x=-y$.\nStep 8:  Now, we need to consider the implications of each of these solutions in the context of the given equations.\nStep 9:  If $x=3y$, then substituting this into the first equation $y^3=x^2$, we get $y^3=(3y)^2$, which simplifies to $y^3=9y^2$. Dividing both sides by $y^2$, we obtain $y=9$.\nStep 10:  Substituting $y=9$ back into the equation $x=3y$, we find that $x=27$.\nStep 11:  On the other hand, if $x=-y$, then substituting this into the first equation $y^3=x^2$, we get $y^3=(-y)^2$, which simplifies to $y^3=y^2$. Dividing both sides by $y^2$, we obtain $y=1$.\nStep 12:  Substituting $y=1$ back into the equation $x=-y$, we find that $x=-1$.\nStep 13:  Therefore, we have two possible solutions: $(x,y)=(27,9)$ or $(x,y)=(-1,1)$.\nStep 14:  To determine which solution is valid, we need to check if it satisfies both of the original equations.\nStep 15:  For the solution $(x,y)=(27,9)$, we can substitute these values into the second equation $(y-x)^2=4y^2$ to verify if it holds true.\nStep 16:  Substituting $x=27$ and $y=9$ into the equation, we get $(9-27)^2=4(9)^2$, which simplifies to $(-18)^2=4(81)$, and further simplifies to $324=324$. This confirms that the solution $(x,y)=(27,9)$ satisfies both equations.\nStep 17:  Therefore, the valid solution is $(x,y)=(27,9)$, and the value of $x+y$ is $27+9=\\boxed{36}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{36}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to carefully examine the given expression and look for a pattern or a way to simplify it.\nStep 2:  The expression given is a series of terms, each of the form $a^3 - b^3$, where $a$ and $b$ are consecutive even and odd integers, respectively.\nStep 3:  We can start by looking at the first few terms of the expression to see if there's a pattern or a way to simplify it.\nStep 4:  The first term is $2^3 - 1^3$, the second term is $4^3 - 3^3$, the third term is $6^3 - 5^3$, and so on.\nStep 5:  We can notice that each term is of the form $a^3 - b^3$, where $a$ and $b$ are consecutive even and odd integers, respectively.\nStep 6:  We can use the difference of cubes factorization to simplify each term. The difference of cubes factorization states that $a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)$.\nStep 7:  Applying this factorization to each term, we get: $2^3 - 1^3 = (2 - 1)(2^2 + 2 \\cdot 1 + 1^2) = 1 \\cdot (4 + 2 + 1) = 7$, $4^3 - 3^3 = (4 - 3)(4^2 + 4 \\cdot 3 + 3^2) = 1 \\cdot (16 + 12 + 9) = 37$, and so on.\nStep 8:  We can see that each term simplifies to a value that is one less than a multiple of 8.\nStep 9:  Therefore, we can rewrite the given expression as: $7 + 37 + 91 + 163 + 259 + 371 + 497 + 639 + 797 + 981 + 1181 + 1407 + 1651 + 1913 + 2193 + 2491 + 2817 + 3169 + 3547 + 3953$.\nStep 10:  Now, we can look for a pattern in the simplified terms to see if there's a way to simplify the expression further.\nStep 11:  We can notice that each term is one less than a multiple of 8, and the terms are increasing by a certain amount each time.\nStep 12:  By examining the terms, we can see that the difference between consecutive terms is increasing by 8 each time.\nStep 13:  Therefore, we can rewrite the expression as: $7 + (7 + 8) + (7 + 2 \\cdot 8) + (7 + 3 \\cdot 8) + (7 + 4 \\cdot 8) + (7 + 5 \\cdot 8) + (7 + 6 \\cdot 8) + (7 + 7 \\cdot 8) + (7 + 8 \\cdot 8) + (7 + 9 \\cdot 8) + (7 + 10 \\cdot 8) + (7 + 11 \\cdot 8) + (7 + 12 \\cdot 8) + (7 + 13 \\cdot 8) + (7 + 14 \\cdot 8) + (7 + 15 \\cdot 8) + (7 + 16 \\cdot 8) + (7 + 17 \\cdot 8) + (7 + 18 \\cdot 8)$.\nStep 14:  Now, we can simplify the expression by combining like terms.\nStep 15:  We can see that each term is of the form $7 + n \\cdot 8$, where $n$ is an integer from 1 to 18.\nStep 16:  We can rewrite the expression as: $7 + 8 + 16 + 24 + 32 + 40 + 48 + 56 + 64 + 72 + 80 + 88 + 96 + 104 + 112 + 120 + 128 + 136 + 144$.\nStep 17:  Now, we can simplify the expression by combining like terms.\nStep 18:  We can see that each term is a multiple of 8, and the terms are increasing by 8 each time.\nStep 19:  Therefore, we can rewrite the expression as: $8(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 + 13 + 14 + 15 + 16 + 17 + 18)$.\nStep 20:  Now, we can simplify the expression by using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.\nStep 21:  The sum of the first $n$ positive integers is given by the formula: $1 + 2 + 3 + \\dots + n = \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}$.\nStep 22:  We can use this formula to simplify the expression: $8(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 + 13 + 14 + 15 + 16 + 17 + 18) = 8 \\cdot \\frac{18(18 + 1)}{2} = 8 \\cdot 171 = 1368$.\nStep 23:  Therefore, the value of the given expression is $\\boxed{1368}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1368}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given information and set up equations to represent the relationships between the number of games won by left-handed and right-handed players.\nStep 2:  Let's denote the number of left-handed players as $L$ and the number of right-handed players as $R$. We are given that there are twice as many right-handed players as left-handed players, so we can express this as $R = 2L$.\nStep 3:  The total number of games played can be calculated using the combination formula, which is given by $\\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$, where $n$ is the total number of participants. In this case, the total number of participants is $L + R$, and the total number of games played is $\\frac{(L+R)(L+R-1)}{2}$.\nStep 4:  We are also given that the number of games won by left-handed players was $40\\%$ more than the number of games won by right-handed players. This can be expressed as $1.4R = L$.\nStep 5:  We can use these two equations to solve for the values of $L$ and $R$.\nStep 6:  Substituting $R = 2L$ into the equation $1.4R = L$, we get $1.4(2L) = L$, which simplifies to $2.8L = L$. This implies that $L = 0$, which is not a valid solution as it would mean there are no left-handed players.\nStep 7:  Therefore, we need to re-examine our approach and consider the relationship between the number of games won by left-handed and right-handed players.\nStep 8:  Let's assume that the number of games won by right-handed players is $x$. Then, the number of games won by left-handed players is $1.4x$.\nStep 9:  The total number of games played can be expressed as the sum of the games won by left-handed and right-handed players, which is $x + 1.4x = 2.4x$.\nStep 10:  We also know that the total number of games played is equal to the total number of participants, which is $L + R$. Since $R = 2L$, we can express the total number of games played as $\\frac{(L+R)(L+R-1)}{2} = \\frac{(3L)(3L-1)}{2}$.\nStep 11:  Equating the two expressions for the total number of games played, we get $2.4x = \\frac{(3L)(3L-1)}{2}$.\nStep 12:  We can simplify this equation to $4.8x = 9L^2 - 3L$.\nStep 13:  Since $x$ represents the number of games won by right-handed players, it must be an integer. Therefore, we need to find integer solutions for $L$ that satisfy the equation $4.8x = 9L^2 - 3L$.\nStep 14:  By trial and error, we find that $L = 4$ satisfies the equation, giving us $x = 10$.\nStep 15:  Therefore, the total number of games played is $2.4x = 2.4 \\times 10 = 24$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{24}$",

The conjugate of $z$ is then $\\overline{z} = x - yi$.\nStep 3:  Substituting $z = x + yi$ and $\\overline{z} = x - yi$ into the equation $z^5 = \\overline{z}$, we get $(x + yi)^5 = x - yi$.\nStep 4:  Expanding the left-hand side of the equation using the binomial theorem, we get $x^5 + 5x^4 yi + 10x^3 y^2 i^2 + 10x^2 y^3 i^3 + 5xy^4 i^4 + y^5 i^5 = x - yi$.\nStep 5:  Simplifying the powers of $i$, we have $x^5 + 5x^4 yi - 10x^3 y^2 - 10x^2 y^3 i + 5xy^4 + y^5 i = x - yi$.\nStep 6:  Equating the real and imaginary parts on both sides of the equation, we get two equations: $x^5 - 10x^3 y^2 + 5xy^4 = x$ and $5x^4 y - 10x^2 y^3 + y^5 = -y$.\nStep 7:  We can simplify the first equation to $x(x^4 - 10x^2 y^2 + 5y^4) = x$, which gives us $x^4 - 10x^2 y^2 + 5y^4 = 1$.\nStep 8:  The second equation can be simplified to $y(5x^4 - 10x^2 y^2 + y^4) = -y$, which gives us $5x^4 - 10x^2 y^2 + y^4 = -1$.\nStep 9:  We can then add the two equations to get $x^4 + 5y^4 = 0$.\nStep 10:  Since $x^4$ and $y^4$ are both nonnegative, the only way for their sum to be zero is if both $x^4$ and $y^4$ are individually zero.\nStep 11:  This implies that $x = 0$ and $y = 0$, so the only solution to the equation $z^5 = \\overline{z}$ is $z = 0$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, there is only $\\boxed{1}$ complex number that satisfies the equation $z^5 = \\overline{z}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

We are given that $o = \\frac{1}{4}$ of a pound.\nStep 4:  We can now set up an equation based on the given information. The weight of $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the pizza and $3 \\frac{1}{2}$ cups of orange slices is equal to the weight of $\\frac{3}{4}$ of the pizza and $\\frac{1}{2}$ cup of orange slices.\nStep 5:  This can be represented as: $\\frac{1}{3}p + 3\\frac{1}{2}o = \\frac{3}{4}p + \\frac{1}{2}o$.\nStep 6:  We can simplify the equation by converting the mixed number $3 \\frac{1}{2}$ to an improper fraction, which is $\\frac{7}{2}$.\nStep 7:  Substituting the value of $o$ as $\\frac{1}{4}$, we get: $\\frac{1}{3}p + \\frac{7}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}p + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}$.\nStep 8:  Simplifying further, we have: $\\frac{1}{3}p + \\frac{7}{8} = \\frac{3}{4}p + \\frac{1}{8}$.\nStep 9:  To isolate the variable $p$, we can multiply the entire equation by 24 to clear the fractions, resulting in: $8p + 21 = 18p + 3$.\nStep 10:  By rearranging the terms, we get: $8p - 18p = 3 - 21$, which simplifies to $-10p = -18$.\nStep 11:  Solving for $p$, we find: $p = \\frac{-18}{-10} = \\frac{9}{5}$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the weight of a large pizza is $\\frac{9}{5}$ pounds.\nStep 13:  The problem asks for the value of $m-n$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers representing the weight of the pizza.\nStep 14:  In this case, $m=9$ and $n=5$, so $m-n = 9-5 = 4$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$",

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to consider the different ways Janet can roll a running total of $3$ at some point during her $4$ rolls of a standard $6$-sided die.\nStep 2:  We'll break down the problem into cases to ensure we cover all possible scenarios.\nStep 3:  Case 1: The running total equals $3$ after the first roll. In this case, the only possibility is that Janet rolls a $3$ on the first roll. The probability of this happening is $\\frac{1}{6}$.\nStep 4:  Case 2: The running total equals $3$ after the second roll. This means that the first roll must be a $1$ or a $2$, and the second roll must be a $2$ or a $1$ respectively. The probability of this happening is $\\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{36} + \\frac{1}{36} = \\frac{1}{18}$.\nStep 5:  Case 3: The running total equals $3$ after the third roll. This means that the first two rolls must be $1$ and $1$, and the third roll must be a $1$.

  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to start by understanding the properties of the logarithmic function $y = \\log_{2}x$ and how it relates to the given information about the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$.\nStep 2:  We are given that the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$ is $(6, 2)$. This means that the average of the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ is $6$, and the average of their $y$-coordinates is $2$.\nStep 3:  Since the $y$-coordinate of any point on the graph of $y = \\log_{2}x$ represents the power to which $2$ must be raised to obtain the $x$-coordinate, we can express the $y$-coordinate of point $A$ as $\\log_{2}a$ and the $y$-coordinate of point $B$ as $\\log_{2}b$.\nStep 4:  Using the midpoint formula, we can set up the equation $\\frac{\\log_{2}a + \\log_{2}b}{2} = 2$ to represent the average of the $y$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$.\nStep 5:  By applying the properties of logarithms, we can simplify the equation to $\\log_{2}ab = 4$, which implies that $ab = 2^4 = 16$.\nStep 6:  We also know that the $x$-coordinate of the midpoint is the geometric mean of the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$. This gives us the equation $6 = \\sqrt{ab}$, which simplifies to $36 = ab$.\nStep 7:  Therefore, we have the equation $ab = 36$, and we need to find the positive difference between the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$.\nStep 8:  To do this, we can use the fact that the product of the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ is $36$, and the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$ is $6$. This allows us to set up the equation $(x - 6)^2 = 36$ to find the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$.\nStep 9:  Solving for $x$, we get $x = 6 \\pm 6$, which gives us the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ as $12$ and $0$.\nStep 10:  The positive difference between the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ is then $12 - 0 = 12$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the positive difference between the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ is $\\boxed{12}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{12}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to consider the possible dates in the year 2023 and determine how many of them will have each digit appearing an even number of times in the 8-digit display.\nStep 2:  We start by considering the constraints for each digit in the 8-digit display. The year 2023 has a fixed 4-digit year, so we only need to focus on the 2-digit month and 2-digit date.\nStep 3:  We first consider the cases where the year 2023 is displayed as 2023yy, where yy represents the 2-digit month and date. In this case, the digits 2 and 3 will appear an odd number of times, so we can exclude this case.\nStep 4:  Next, we consider the case where the year 2023 is displayed as 20yy3, where yy represents the 2-digit month and date. Here, the digits 2 and 3 will appear an odd number of times, so we can exclude this case as well.\nStep 5:  Moving on, we consider the case where the year 2023 is displayed as 2yy03, where yy represents the 2-digit month and date. In this case, the digits 0 and 2 will appear an odd number of times, so we can exclude this case.\nStep 6:  Finally, we consider the case where the year 2023 is displayed as 2020yy, where yy represents the 2-digit month and date. Here, the digits 0 and 2 will appear an odd number of times, so we can exclude this case as well.\nStep 7:  After considering all the cases, we find that the only possible dates that satisfy the condition are those in the format 20yy22, where yy represents the 2-digit month and date.\nStep 8:  We then need to find the number of dates in the format 20yy22. Since the month and date are represented by the 2-digit yy, we can have 00, 01, 02, ..., 09, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 as the possible values for yy.\nStep 9:  However, we need to exclude the cases where yy is 00, 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, or 99, as these will result in the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 appearing an odd number of times.\nStep 10:  After excluding these cases, we are left with 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, and 99 as the possible values for yy.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the total number of dates in the format 20yy22 is 45.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{45}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first understand the relationship between the mean of Maureen's quiz scores and the scores she achieves on her next quizzes.\nStep 2:  Let's denote the current mean of her quiz scores as $x$. The total score of all quizzes taken so far is $nx$, where $n$ is the number of quizzes taken.\nStep 3:  If Maureen scores an $11$ on the next quiz, her new total score becomes $nx + 11$, and the new mean is $x + 1$. This gives us the equation $nx + 11 = n(x + 1)$.\nStep 4:  If she scores an $11$ on each of the next three quizzes, her new total score becomes $nx + 33$, and the new mean is $x + 2$. This gives us the equation $nx + 33 = n(x + 2)$.\nStep 5:  We can simplify the first equation to $nx + 11 = nx + n$, and the second equation to $nx + 33 = nx + 2n$.\nStep 6:  By subtracting $nx$ from both sides of each equation, we get $11 = n$ and $33 = 2n$.\nStep 7:  Solving for $n$ in the first equation gives us $n = 11$, and solving for $n$ in the second equation gives us $n = 16.5$.\nStep 8:  However, we notice that $n$ cannot be $16.5$ since the number of quizzes must be an integer. Therefore, we discard the second equation and proceed with the first equation.\nStep 9:  Substituting $n = 11$ into the equation $nx + 11 = n(x + 1)$, we get $11x + 11 = 11(x + 1)$.\nStep 10:  Simplifying this equation, we get $11x + 11 = 11x + 11$, which is a true statement for all values of $x$.\nStep 11:  However, we also know that $n = 11$ is the only solution to the equation $nx + 11 = n(x + 1)$, so we can conclude that $n = 11$ is the correct value for the number of quizzes taken.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the current mean of her quiz scores is $x = \\frac{11}{11} = \\boxed{1}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",

Therefore, the total amount of juice in the first three glasses is $3x$.\nStep 4:  Since the fourth glass is only $\\frac{1}{3}$ full, the amount of juice in it is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\nStep 5:  To make all four glasses have the same amount of juice, we need to find the amount of juice that should be poured from each of the first three glasses into the fourth glass.\nStep 6:  This can be represented by the equation $3x - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{4}(3x + \\frac{1}{3})$, where $\\frac{1}{4}(3x + \\frac{1}{3})$ represents the total amount of juice in all four glasses after the transfer.\nStep 7:  Solving this equation will give us the value of $x$, which represents the amount of juice in each of the first three glasses.\nStep 8:  Once we have the value of $x$, we can find the fraction of a glass that Mrs. Jones must pour from each of the first three glasses into the fourth glass.\nStep 9:  The fraction of a glass to be poured is given by $\\frac{1}{3} - x$, and we need to find the sum of the numerator and denominator of this fraction.\nStep 10:  Therefore, our final answer will be the sum of the numerator and denominator of the fraction $\\frac{1}{3} - x$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5}$",

The equation of the smaller circle is $(x-4)^2+y^2=16$, and the equation of the larger circle is $x^2+(y-10)^2=100$.\nStep 6:  By solving these equations simultaneously, we can find the points of intersection, which we'll denote as $C$ and $D$.\nStep 7:  The line passing through points $C$ and $D$ will have a slope that we need to find.\nStep 8:  To find the slope of this line, we can use the formula for the slope of a line given two points, which is $\\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$.\nStep 9:  We can then simplify the expression to obtain the slope in the form $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.\nStep 10:  Finally, we need to find the sum of $m$ and $n$ to obtain the final answer.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{11}$",

  "## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the behavior of the polynomial $P(x)$ on the given intervals.\n## Step 2:  The polynomial $P(x)$ is defined as the product of linear factors of the form $(x - k)^{k}$, where $k$ ranges from $1$ to $10$.\n## Step 3:  We are interested in determining the number of intervals on which $P(x)$ is positive after removing the roots from the number line.\n## Step 4:  To do this, we need to consider the sign of $P(x)$ on each of the $11$ disjoint open intervals created by the roots.\n## Step 5:  We can start by analyzing the behavior of $P(x)$ on the intervals $(-\\infty, 1)$, $(1, 2)$, $(2, 3)$, and so on up to $(10, \\infty)$.\n## Step 6:  On each of these intervals, we need to determine the number of sign changes in the product of the linear factors.\n## Step 7:  A sign change occurs when the exponent of a factor is odd, as this results in a negative sign in the product.\n## Step 8:  We can count the number of sign changes for each interval by considering the exponents of the factors.\n## Step 9:  For example, on the interval $(1, 2)$, the factor $(x-1)$ has an exponent of $1$, which is odd, resulting in a sign change.\n## Step 10:  Similarly, on the interval $(2, 3)$, the factor $(x-2)$ has an exponent of $2$, which is even, resulting in no sign change.\n## Step 11:  We can continue this process for each interval to determine the number of sign changes.\n## Step 12:  Once we have the number of sign changes for each interval, we can use this information to determine the number of intervals on which $P(x)$ is positive.\n## Step 13:  We can use the fact that $P(x)$ is positive on an interval if and only if the number of sign changes in the product of the linear factors is even.\n## Step 14:  By counting the number of sign changes for each interval, we can determine the number of intervals on which $P(x)$ is positive.\n## Step 15:  After analyzing the behavior of $P(x)$ on each interval, we can conclude that $P(x)$ is positive on $7$ of the $11$ intervals.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$",
  "Step 1:  To find the values of $n$ for which the given expression represents a real number, we need to analyze the expression step by step.\nStep 2:  The expression involves logarithms and square roots, so we'll start by simplifying the expression using the properties of logarithms.\nStep 3:  We're given the expression \\[\\sqrt{\\frac{\\log (n^2) - (\\log n)^2}{\\log n - 3}}.\\]\nStep 4:  Using the property of logarithms that $\\log a^b = b \\log a$, we can simplify $\\log (n^2)$ to $2 \\log n$.\nStep 5:  Substituting this into the expression, we get \\[\\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\log n - (\\log n)^2}{\\log n - 3}}.\\]\nStep 6:  Next, we can factor the numerator to obtain \\[\\sqrt{\\frac{(\\log n)(2 - \\log n)}{\\log n - 3}}.\\]\nStep 7:  Now, we need to consider the conditions under which this expression represents a real number. For the expression to be real, the radicand (the number inside the square root) must be nonnegative, and the denominator must be nonzero.\nStep 8:  The radicand is nonnegative if $(\\log n)(2 - \\log n) \\ge 0$, and the denominator is nonzero if $\\log n - 3 \\neq 0$.\nStep 9:  We can solve the inequality $(\\log n)(2 - \\log n) \\ge 0$ by considering the two factors separately. This inequality holds if either both factors are nonnegative or both factors are nonpositive.\nStep 10:  The first factor, $\\log n$, is nonnegative if $n \\ge 10^0 = 1$, and the second factor, $2 - \\log n$, is nonnegative if $n \\le 10^2 = 100$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the inequality $(\\log n)(2 - \\log n) \\ge 0$ holds if $1 \\le n \\le 100$.\nStep 12:  Additionally, the denominator is nonzero if $\\log n - 3 \\neq 0$, which is equivalent to $n \\neq 10^3 = 1000$.\nStep 13:  Combining these conditions, we find that the expression represents a real number if $1 \\le n \\le 100$ and $n \\neq 1000$.\nStep 14:  Therefore, the number of integers $n$ for which the expression represents a real number is the number of integers in the interval $1 \\le n \\le 100$ excluding $n = 1000$.\nStep 15:  This gives us a total of $100 - 1 = 99$ integers.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{99}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to find the number of nonempty subsets $B$ of the set ${0, 1, 2, 3, \\cdots, 12}$ such that the number of elements in $B$ is equal to the least element of $B$.\nStep 2:  We can approach this problem by considering the possible sizes of the subsets and then counting the number of subsets for each size.\nStep 3:  The smallest possible subset is of size 1, which can be formed in only 1 way, as there is only one element in the set that can be the least element.\nStep 4:  For subsets of size 2, the least element can be 2, and there are $\\binom{10}{1}$ ways to choose the remaining element from the set ${3, 4, 5, \\cdots, 12}$.\nStep 5:  Similarly, for subsets of size 3, the least element can be 3, and there are $\\binom{9}{2}$ ways to choose the remaining two elements from the set ${4, 5, 6, \\cdots, 12}$.\nStep 6:  This pattern continues until we reach subsets of size 12, where the least element can be 12, and there are $\\binom{1}{11}$ ways to choose the remaining 11 elements from the set ${13}$.\nStep 7:  We can calculate the total number of subsets by summing up the number of subsets for each size from 1 to 12.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the total number of subsets is given by the expression $1 + \\binom{10}{1} + \\binom{9}{2} + \\binom{8}{3} + \\binom{7}{4} + \\binom{6}{5} + \\binom{5}{6} + \\binom{4}{7} + \\binom{3}{8} + \\binom{2}{9} + \\binom{1}{10} + \\binom{0}{11}$.\nStep 9:  Simplifying this expression, we get $1 + 10 + 36 + 56 + 35 + 6 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 144$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the total number of nonempty subsets $B$ of ${0, 1, 2, 3, \\cdots, 12}$ that satisfy the given condition is $\\boxed{144}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{144}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the given inequality and how it defines a region in the coordinate plane.\nStep 2:  The given inequality is $| | x | - 1 | + | | y | - 1 | \\le 1$. This involves absolute values, so we need to consider different cases based on the signs of $x$ and $y$.\nStep 3:  We start by considering the case when $x \\ge 0$ and $y \\ge 0$. In this case, the inequality simplifies to $|x - 1| + |y - 1| \\le 1$. We can further break this down into two sub-cases: when $x \\ge 1$ and $y \\ge 1$, and when $0 \\le x < 1$ and $0 \\le y < 1$.\nStep 4:  For the first sub-case, when $x \\ge 1$ and $y \\ge 1$, the inequality becomes $x - 1 + y - 1 \\le 1$, which simplifies to $x + y \\le 3$. This defines a triangle in the first quadrant with vertices at $(0,0)$, $(3,0)$, and $(0,3)$.\nStep 5:  For the second sub-case, when $0 \\le x < 1$ and $0 \\le y < 1$, the inequality becomes $1 - x + 1 - y \\le 1$, which simplifies to $x + y \\ge 1$. This defines a triangle in the first quadrant with vertices at $(0,0)$, $(1,0)$, and $(0,1)$.\nStep 6:  We repeat this process for the other three quadrants, considering the cases when $x < 0$ and $y \\ge 0$, $x \\ge 0$ and $y < 0$, and $x < 0$ and $y < 0$.\nStep 7:  After considering all the cases, we find that the region defined by the inequality is a square with side length 2, centered at the origin.\nStep 8:  The area of this square is given by the formula $side^2$, which in this case is $2^2 = 4$.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the area of the region defined by the given inequality is $\\boxed{4}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4}$"
