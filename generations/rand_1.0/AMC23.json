  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance from City A where Alicia and Beth will meet when they both start biking towards each other at the same time.\nStep 2:  First, let's understand the given information. Cities A and B are 45 miles apart. Alicia lives in A and bikes towards B at 18 miles per hour. Beth lives in B and bikes towards A at 12 miles per hour.\nStep 3:  Since they are biking towards each other, their combined speed is 18 + 12 = 30 miles per hour. This means that together, they are covering 30 miles per hour.\nStep 4:  The time it takes for them to meet can be calculated using the formula time = distance / speed. In this case, the distance is 45 miles, and their combined speed is 30 miles per hour. So, time = 45 / 30 = 1.5 hours.\nStep 5:  Now, to find the distance from City A where they will meet, we need to calculate how far Alicia has traveled in 1.5 hours. Since Alicia bikes at 18 miles per hour, the distance she covers in 1.5 hours is 18 * 1.5 = 27 miles.\nStep 6:  Therefore, when they meet, Alicia will be 27 miles from City A.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{27}$",
  "Step 1: Problem Explanation\nWe are given two equations involving positive real numbers x and y: y^3 = x^2 and (y - x)^2 = 4y^2. We need to find the value of x + y.\n\nStep 2: \nTo solve this problem, we can start by manipulating the second equation to express x in terms of y. Then, substitute this expression into the first equation to solve for y. Once we have y, we can find x and then compute x + y.\n\nStep 3: \nFirst, let's expand the second equation: (y - x)^2 = 4y^2. This gives us y^2 - 2yx + x^2 = 4y^2. Rearranging terms, we get x^2 - 2yx - 3y^2 = 0.\n\nStep 4: \nNow, we can treat this as a quadratic equation in x. Let's use the quadratic formula: x = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a, where a = 1, b = -2y, and c = -3y^2.\n\nStep 5: \nPlugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get x = (2y \u00b1 sqrt((-2y)^2 - 4(1)(-3y^2))) / 2(1). Simplifying, x = (2y \u00b1 sqrt(4y^2 + 12y^2)) / 2. This gives x = (2y \u00b1 sqrt(16y^2)) / 2 = (2y \u00b1 4y) / 2.\n\nStep 6: \nSo, we have two possible values for x: x = (2y + 4y) / 2 = 6y / 2 = 3y or x = (2y - 4y) / 2 = -2y / 2 = -y. Since x is a positive real number, we must have x = 3y.\n\nStep 7: \nNow, substitute x = 3y into the first equation: y^3 = (3y)^2. This gives y^3 = 9y^2. Dividing both sides by y^2 (since y is positive, y^2 is positive), we get y = 9.\n\nStep 8: \nTherefore, y = 9. Then, x = 3y = 3(9) = 27.\n\nStep 9: \nFinally, compute x + y: x + y = 27 + 9 = 36.\n\nStep 10: \nTherefore, x + y = 36.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{36}",
  "Problem: What is the degree measure of the acute angle formed by lines with slopes $2$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$?\n\nStep 1: To find the degree measure of the acute angle formed by two lines with slopes 2 and 1/3, we can use the formula for the angle between two lines. The formula is given by:\n\ntan(\u03b8) = |(m1 - m2) / (1 + m1*m2)|\n\nwhere \u03b8 is the angle between the lines, and m1 and m2 are the slopes of the lines.\n\nStep 2: In this problem, m1 = 2 and m2 = 1/3. We need to substitute these values into the formula and solve for \u03b8.\n\nStep 3: First, let's compute the numerator of the fraction inside the absolute value:\n\nm1 - m2 = 2 - 1/3 = (6 - 1)/3 = 5/3\n\nStep 4: Next, compute the denominator:\n\n1 + m1*m2 = 1 + (2)*(1/3) = 1 + 2/3 = (3 + 2)/3 = 5/3\n\nStep 5: Now, substitute these values into the formula:\n\ntan(\u03b8) = |(5/3) / (5/3)| = |1| = 1\n\nStep 6: Since tan(\u03b8) = 1, we know that \u03b8 is equal to 45\u00b0, because the tangent of 45\u00b0 is 1.\n\nStep 7: However, the problem asks for the acute angle, so we need to make sure that \u03b8 is less than 90\u00b0. Since 45\u00b0 is less than 90\u00b0, the acute angle is 45\u00b0.\n\nStep 8: Therefore, the degree measure of the acute angle formed by lines with slopes 2 and 1/3 is 45\u00b0.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{45}",
  "Step 1: The problem presents a series of cubes with alternating signs. We need to compute the sum of this series from 2^3 - 1^3 up to 18^3 - 17^3.\n\nStep 2: The series can be written as: (2^3 - 1^3) + (4^3 - 3^3) + (6^3 - 5^3) + ... + (18^3 - 17^3).\n\nStep 3: Each term in the series is a difference of cubes. We can factor each term as (a^3 - b^3) = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2).\n\nStep 4: So, the series can be rewritten as: [(2 - 1)(2^2 + 2*1 + 1^2)] + [(4 - 3)(4^2 + 4*3 + 3^2)] + [(6 - 5)(6^2 + 6*5 + 5^2)] + ... + [(18 - 17)(18^2 + 18*17 + 17^2)].\n\nStep 5: Each term is of the form (n - (n - 1))(n^2 + n*(n - 1) + (n - 1)^2), where n starts from 2 and goes up to 18.\n\nStep 6: Let's compute the first few

271.\n\nStep 12: For n = 12: (12 - 11)(12^2 + 12*11 + 11^2) = 1*(144 + 132 + 121) = 397.\n\nStep 13: For n = 14: (14 - 13)(14^2 + 14*13 + 13^2) = 1*(196 + 182 + 169) = 547.\n\nStep 14: For n = 16: (16 - 15)(16^2 + 16*15 + 15^2) = 1*(256 + 240 + 225) = 721.\n\nStep 15: For n = 18: (18 - 17)(18^2 + 18*17 + 17^2) = 1*(324 + 306 + 289) = 919.\n\nStep 16: The terms are increasing by 30, 54, 78, 114,

  "Step 1: Let's denote the number of left-handed players as L and the number of right-handed players as R. We are given that R = 2L.\n\nStep 2: The total number of participants is L + R = L + 2L = 3L.\n\nStep 3: Each participant plays every other participant exactly once. Therefore, the total number of games played is the number of ways to choose two participants from the total number of participants, which is given by the combination formula C(n, 2) = n(n-1)/2, where n is the total number of participants. So, the total number of games is 3L(3L-1)/2.\n\nStep 4: Let's denote the number of games won by left-handed players as G_L and the number of games won by right-handed players as G_R. We are given that G_L = 1.4G_R.\n\nStep 5: Since each game is played between two players, the total number of games won by left-handed players is the number of games played by left-handed players minus the number of games lost by left-handed players. Similarly, the total number of games won by right-handed players is the number of games played by right-handed players minus the number of games lost by right-handed players.\n\nStep 6: Let's denote the number of games played by left-handed players as P_L and the number of games played by right-handed players as P_R. Then, G_L = P_L - L*P_R and G_R = P_R - R*P_L.\n\nStep 7: Since each participant plays every other participant exactly once, the number of games played by left-handed players is the number of ways to choose two left-handed players, which is C(L, 2), plus the number of games played by left-handed players against right-handed players, which is L*R. Similarly, the number of games played by right-handed players is C(R, 2) + R*L.\n\nStep 8: Therefore, P_L = C(L, 2) + L*R and P_R = C(R, 2) + R*L.\n\nStep 9: Substituting R = 2L, we have P_L = C(L, 2) + 2L^2 and P_R = C(2L, 2) + 2L^2.\n\nStep 10: Since C(n, 2) = n(n-1)/2, we have P_L = L(L-1)/2 + 2L^2 and P_R = 2L(2L-1)/2 + 2L^2.\n\nStep 11: Simplifying, P_L = L^2 - L/2 + 2L^2 = 5L^2 - L/2 and P_R = 2L^2 + 2L^2 - L = 4L^2 - L.\n\nStep 12: Therefore, G_L = P_L - L*P_R = (5L^2 - L/2) - L*(4L^2 - L) = 5L^2 - L/2 - 4L^3 + L^2 = 6L^2 - 4L^3 - L/2.\n\nStep 13: Similarly, G_R = P_R - R*P_L = (4L^2 - L) - 2L*(5L^2 - L/2) = 4L^2 - L - 10L^3 + L^2 = 5L^2 - 10L^3 - L.\n\nStep 14: Given that G_L = 1.4G_R, we have 6L^2 - 4L^3 - L/2 = 1.4(5L^2 - 10L^3 - L).\n\nStep 15: Simplifying, 6L^2 - 4L^3 - L/2 = 7L^2 - 14L^3 - 1.4L.\n\nStep 16: Combining like terms, -4L^3 + 6L^2 - 1.4L - L/2 = -14L^3 + 7L^2 - 1.4L.\n\nStep 17: Equating coefficients, -4L^3 + 6L^2 - 1.4L - L/2 = -14L^3 + 7L^2 - 1.4L.\n\nStep 18: Equating coefficients of L^3: -4 = -14. This is a contradiction, so there is no solution.\n\nStep 19: However, let's check if there is a solution for L that satisfies the equation.\n\nStep 20: Let's rewrite the equation as -4L^3 + 6L^2 - 1.4L - L/2 = -14L^3 + 7L^2 - 1.4L.\n\nStep 21: Subtracting -14L^3 + 7L^2 - 1.4L from both sides, we get 10L^3 - L^2 + 0.6L + L/2 = 0.\n\nStep 22: Multiplying by 2 to eliminate the fraction, we get 20L^3 - 2L^2 + L + L = 0.\n\nStep 23: Combining like terms, 20L^3 - 2L^2 + 2L = 0.\n\nStep 24: Factoring out L, we get L(20L^2 - 2L + 2) = 0.\n\nStep 25: Therefore, either L = 0 or 20L^2 - 2L + 2 = 0.\n\nStep 26: If L = 0, then the number of left-handed players is 0, which is not possible since there are twice as many right-handed players as left-handed players.\n\nStep 27: Therefore, we need to solve 20L^2 - 2L + 2 = 0.\n\nStep 28: Dividing by 2, we get 10L^2 - L + 1 = 0.\n\nStep 29: This is a quadratic equation in L.\n\nStep 30: Let's use the quadratic formula: L = (-b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a, where a = 10, b = -1, c = 1.\n\nStep 31: Plugging in the values, L = (1 \u00b1 sqrt((-1)^2 - 4*10*1)) / (2*10).\n\nStep 32: Simplifying, L = (1 \u00b1 sqrt(1 - 40)) / 20.\n\nStep 33: L = (1 \u00b1 sqrt(-39)) / 20.\n\nStep 34: Since sqrt(-39) is an imaginary number, there is no real solution for L.\n\nStep 35: Therefore, there is no solution for L that satisfies the equation.\n\nStep 36: However, let's check if there is a solution for L that satisfies the original problem.\n\nStep 37: Let's go back to the original problem.\n\nStep 38: The total number of games played is 3L(3L-1)/2.\n\nStep 39: The number of games won by left-handed players is 40% more than the number of games won by right-handed players.\n\nStep 40: Let's denote the number of games won by right-handed players as G_R.\n\nStep 41: Then, the number of games won by left-handed players is 1.4G_R.\n\nStep 42: Therefore, the total number of games won is G_L + G_R = 1.4G_R + G_R = 2.4G_R.\n\nStep 43: Since each game is played between two players, the total number of games played is equal to the total number of games won.\n\nStep 44: Therefore, 3L(3L-1)/2 = 2.4G_R.\n\nStep 45: Since G_R = P_R - R*P_L, we need to find P_R and P_L.\n\nStep 46: P_R = C(R, 2) + R*L = C(2L, 2) + 2L*L = 2L(2L-1)/2 + 2L^2 = 2L^2 + 2L^2 - L = 4L^2 - L.\n\nStep 47: P_L = C(L, 2) + L*R = L(L-1)/2 + 2L^2 = 5L^2 - L/2.\n\nStep 48: Therefore, G_R = P_R - R*P_L = (4L^2 - L) - 2L*(5L^2 - L/2) = 4L^2 - L - 10L^3 + L^2 = 5L^2 - 10L^3 - L.\n\nStep 49: Therefore, 3L(3L-1)/2 = 2.4(5L^2 - 10L^3 - L).\n\nStep 50: Simplifying, 3L(3L-1)/2 = 12L^2 - 24L^3 - 2.4L.\n\nStep 51: Multiplying by 2, we get 3L(3L-1) = 24L^2 - 24L^3 - 4.8L.\n\nStep 52: Expanding, 9L^2 - 3L = 24L^2 - 24L^3 - 4.8L.\n\nStep 53: Combining like terms, 24L^3 - 15L^2 + 0.8L = 0.\n\nStep 54: Dividing by 0.8, we get 30L^3 - 18.75L^2 + 1 = 0.\n\nStep 55: Let's try to solve this equation.\n\nStep 56: Let's check if L = 1 is a solution.\n\nStep 57: Plugging in L = 1, we get 30(1)^3 - 18.75(1)^2 + 1 = 30 - 18.75 + 1 = 12.25.\n\nStep 58: Since 12.25 \u2260 0, L = 1 is not a solution.\n\nStep 59: Let's try L = 2.\n\nStep 60: Plugging in L = 2, we get 30(2)^3 - 18.75(2)^2 + 1 = 240 - 75 + 1 = 166.\n\nStep 61: Since 166 \u2260 0, L = 2 is not a solution.\n\nStep 62: Let's try L = 3.\n\nStep 63: Plugging in L = 3, we get 30(3)^3 - 18.75(3)^2 + 1 = 810 - 168.75 + 1 = 642.25.\n\nStep 64: Since 642.25 \u2260 0, L = 3 is not a solution.\n\nStep 65: Let's try L = 4.\n\nStep 66: Plugging in L = 4, we get 30(4)^3 - 18.75(4)^2 + 1 = 3840 - 300 + 1 = 3541.\n\nStep 67: Since 3541 \u2260 0, L = 4 is not a solution.\n\nStep 68: Let's try L = 5.\n\nStep 69: Plugging in L = 5, we get 30(5)^3 - 18.75(5)^2 + 1 = 7500 - 468.75 + 1 = 7032.25.\n\nStep 70: Since 7032.25 \u2260 0, L = 5 is not a solution.\n\nStep 71: Let's try L = 6.\n\nStep 72: Plugging in L = 6, we get 30(6)^3 - 18.75(6)^2 + 1 = 6480 - 675 + 1 = 5806.\n\nStep 73: Since 5806 \u2260 0, L = 6 is not a solution.\n\nStep 74: Let's try L = 7.\n\nStep 75: Plugging in L = 7, we get 30(7)^3 - 18.75(7)^2 + 1 = 10290 - 1031.25 + 1 = 9260.\n\nStep 76: Since 9260 \u2260 0, L = 7 is not a solution.\n\nStep 77: Let's try L = 8.\n\nStep 78: Plugging in L = 8, we get 30(8)^3 - 18.75(8)^2 + 1 = 15360 - 1200 + 1 = 14161.\n\nStep 79: Since 14161 \u2260 0, L = 8 is not a solution.\n\nStep 80: Let's try L = 9.\n\nStep 81: Plugging in L = 9, we get 30(9)^3 -

  "Problem: How many complex numbers satisfy the equation \\( z^5 = \\overline{z} \\), where \\( \\overline{z} \\) is the conjugate of the complex number \\( z \\). \n\nStep 1: Let's start by understanding the problem. We need to find the number of complex numbers \\( z \\) that satisfy the equation \\( z^5 = \\overline{z} \\), where \\( \\overline{z} \\) is the conjugate of \\( z \\). \n\nStep 2: To approach this problem, we can represent \\( z \\) in polar form. Let \\( z = r(\\cos \\theta + i\\sin \\theta) \\), where \\( r \\) is the modulus and \\( \\theta \\) is the argument of \\( z \\). Then, the conjugate \\( \\overline{z} \\) is \\( r(\\cos \\theta - i\\sin \\theta) \\). \n\nStep 3: Substitute \\( z \\) and \\( \\overline{z} \\) into the equation \\( z^5 = \\overline{z} \\). This gives us \\( r^5(\\cos 5\\theta + i\\sin 5\\theta) = r(\\cos \\theta - i\\sin \\theta) \\). \n\nStep 4: Since \\( r \\) is a modulus, it must be non-negative. Therefore, we can divide both sides by \\( r \\) to get \\( r^4(\\cos 5\\theta + i\\sin 5\\theta) = \\cos \\theta - i\\sin \\theta \\). \n\nStep 5: Equating the real and imaginary parts, we get two equations: \\( r^4\\cos 5\\theta = \\cos \\theta \\) and \\( r^4\\sin 5\\theta = -\\sin \\theta \\). \n\nStep 6: Since \\( r \\) is non-negative, \\( r^4 \\) is also non-negative. Therefore, the signs of the left-hand sides of both equations must match the signs of the right-hand sides. \n\nStep 7: For the first equation, \\( r^4\\cos 5\\theta = \\cos \\theta \\). Since \\( \\cos \\theta \\) can be positive or negative, we need to consider both cases. \n\nStep 8: If \\( \\cos \\theta \\) is positive, then \\( r^4\\cos 5\\theta = \\cos \\theta \\) implies \\( r^4 = 1 \\), which means \\( r = 1 \\). Then, \\( \\cos 5\\theta = \\cos \\theta \\). This equation has solutions when \\( 5\\theta = \\theta + 2k\\pi \\) or \\( 5\\theta = -\\theta + 2k\\pi \\), where \\( k \\) is an integer. \n\nStep 9: Solving \\( 5\\theta = \\theta + 2k\\pi \\) gives \\( 4\\theta = 2k\\pi \\), so \\( \\theta = \\frac{k\\pi}{2} \\). Similarly, solving \\( 5\\theta = -\\theta + 2k\\pi \\) gives \\( 6\\theta = 2k\\pi \\), so \\( \\theta = \\frac{k\\pi}{3} \\). \n\nStep 10: Therefore, for \\( r = 1 \\), the solutions are \\( \\theta = \\frac{k\\pi}{2} \\) and \\( \\theta = \\frac{k\\pi}{3} \\) for integer \\( k \\). \n\nStep 11: Similarly, if \\( \\cos \\theta \\) is negative, then \\( r^4\\cos 5\\theta = \\cos \\theta \\) implies \\( r^4 = -1 \\), which is not possible since \\( r^4 \\) is non-negative. \n\nStep 12: Therefore, the solutions are \\( r = 1 \\) and \\( \\theta = \\frac{k\\pi}{2} \\) or \\( \\theta = \\frac{k\\pi}{3} \\) for integer \\( k \\). \n\nStep 13: However, we need to check if these solutions satisfy the second equation \\( r^4\\sin 5\\theta = -\\sin \\theta \\). \n\nStep 14: Substituting \\( r = 1 \\) and \\( \\theta = \\frac{k\\pi}{2} \\) into the second equation gives \\( \\sin 5\\frac{k\\pi}{2} = -\\sin \\frac{k\\pi}{2} \\). \n\nStep 15: Since \\( \\sin \\frac{k\\pi}{2} \\) is positive for odd \\( k \\) and negative for even \\( k \\), the left-hand side is positive for odd \\( k \\) and negative for even \\( k \\). Therefore, the equation is satisfied for odd \\( k \\). \n\nStep 16: Similarly, substituting \\( r = 1 \\) and \\( \\theta = \\frac{k\\pi}{3} \\) into the second equation gives \\( \\sin 5\\frac{k\\pi}{3} = -\\sin \\frac{k\\pi}{3} \\). \n\nStep 17: Since \\( \\sin \\frac{k\\pi}{3} \\) is positive for \\( k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3} \\) and negative for \\( k \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3} \\), the left-hand side is positive for \\( k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3} \\) and negative for \\( k \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3} \\). Therefore, the equation is satisfied for \\( k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3} \\). \n\nStep 18: Therefore, the solutions are \\( r = 1 \\) and \\( \\theta = \\frac{k\\pi}{2} \\) for odd \\( k \\), and \\( \\theta = \\frac{k\\pi}{3} \\) for \\( k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3} \\). \n\nStep 19: Since \\( k \\) is an integer, the number of solutions is the number of odd integers and the number of integers congruent to 1 modulo 3. \n\nStep 20: The number of odd integers is infinite, but since \\( \\theta \\) is an argument, it must be in the interval \\( [0, 2\\pi) \\). Therefore, we need to find the number of odd integers \\( k \\) such that \\( 0 \\leq \\frac{k\\pi}{2} < 2\\pi \\), which is equivalent to \\( 0 \\leq k < 4 \\). Therefore, the number of odd integers \\( k \\) is 2. \n\nStep 21: Similarly, the number of integers congruent to 1 modulo 3 is infinite, but since \\( \\theta \\) is an argument, it must be in the interval \\( [0, 2\\pi) \\). Therefore, we need to find the number of integers \\( k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3} \\) such that \\( 0 \\leq \\frac{k\\pi}{3} < 2\\pi \\), which is equivalent to \\( 0 \\leq k < 6 \\). Therefore, the number of integers \\( k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3} \\) is 2. \n\nStep 22: Therefore, the total number of solutions is 2 + 2 = 4. \n\nStep 23: Therefore, the number of complex numbers satisfying the equation \\( z^5 = \\overline{z} \\) is 4. \n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{4}",
  "Step 1: Problem Explanation\nWe are given the equation $|1+z+z^{2}|=4$, where $z$ is a complex number. We need to find the maximum value of the imaginary part of $z$ and express it in the form $\\tfrac{\\sqrt{m}}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Then, we have to find $m+n$.\n\nStep 2: To solve this problem, we can start by representing $z$ as $x+yi$, where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers. Then, we can substitute this into the given equation and simplify. We can use the fact that $|a+bi|=\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$ for any complex number $a+bi$. So, the equation becomes $|1+(x+yi)+(x+yi)^2|=4$. We can expand the square and simplify the expression.\n\nStep 3: Let's substitute $z=x+yi$ into the equation $|1+z+z^{2}|=4$. Then, we have $|1+(x+yi)+(x+yi)^2|=4$. Expanding $(x+yi)^2$ gives $(x^2-y^2)+2xyi$. So, the equation becomes $|1+(x+yi)+(x^2-y^2)+2xyi|=4$. Simplifying the left-hand side, we get $|x^2+x+1+(y^2-1)i+2xyi|=4$. Therefore, the absolute value of the complex number is $4$, so we can write this as $\\sqrt{(x^2+x+1)^2+(y^2-1)^2+4x^2y^2}=4$. Squaring both sides, we get $(x^2+x+1)^2+(y^2-1)^2+4x^2y^2=16$. Expanding the squares, we have $x^4+2x^3+x^2+x^2+2x+1+y^4-2y^2+1+4x^2y^2=16$. Simplifying, we get $x^4+2x^3+2x^2+2x+y^4-2y^2+4x^2y^2=16$. Rearranging terms, we have $x^4+2x^3+2x^2+2x+y^4-2y^2+4x^2y^2-16=0$. This is a quartic equation in $x$ and a quadratic equation in $y$. However, since we are interested in the maximum value of the imaginary part $y$, we can treat $x$ as a parameter and solve for $y$.\n\nStep 4: Let's treat $x$ as a parameter and solve for $y$. The equation becomes $y^4-2y^2+4x^2y^2-16=0$. Let's substitute $u=y^2$. Then, the equation becomes $u^2-2u+4x^2u-16=0$. This is a quadratic equation in $u$. Let's factor out $u$: $u(u-2+4x^2u)-16=0$. Rearranging, we get $u(1+4x^2)u-2u-16=0$. Let's rewrite this as $u^2(1+4x^2)-2u-16=0$. Let's denote $a=1+4x^2$ and $b=-2$. Then, the equation becomes $u^2a+bu-16=0$. This is a quadratic equation in $u$. Let's solve for $u$ using the quadratic formula: $u=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$. In this case, $a=1+4x^2$, $b=-2$, and $c=-16$. Plugging these into the formula, we get $u=\\frac{2\\pm\\sqrt{4+4(1+4x^2)(16)}}{2(1+4x^2)}$. Simplifying, we have $u=\\frac{2\\pm\\sqrt{4+64+64x^2+256x^4}}{2(1+4x^2)}$. Combining terms, we get $u=\\frac{2\\pm\\sqrt{68+64x^2+256x^4}}{2(1+4x^2)}$. Let's denote $d=68+64x^2+256x^4$. Then, the equation becomes $u=\\frac{2\\pm\\sqrt{d}}{2(1+4x^2)}$. Since $u=y^2$, we have $y^2=\\frac{2\\pm\\sqrt{d}}{2(1+4x^2)}$. Taking the square root, we get $y=\\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pm\\sqrt{d}}{2(1+4x^2)}}$. Since we are interested in the maximum value of the imaginary part $y$, we take the positive square root: $y=\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pm\\sqrt{d}}{2(1+4x^2)}}$. Let's denote $k=\\frac{2+\\sqrt{d}}{2(1+4x^2)}$. Then, $y=\\sqrt{k}$. Therefore, the maximum value of $y$ is $\\sqrt{k}$.\n\nStep 5: To find the maximum value of $y$, we need to maximize $k=\\frac{2+\\sqrt{d}}{2(1+4x^2)}$. Let's analyze the expression. The numerator is $2+\\sqrt{d}=2+\\sqrt{68+64x^2+256x^4}$. The denominator is $2(1+4x^2)=2+8x^2$. Therefore, $k=\\frac{2+\\sqrt{d}}{2+8x^2}$. To maximize $k$, we need to minimize the denominator and maximize the numerator. Let's analyze the numerator first. The numerator is $2+\\sqrt{d}=2+\\sqrt{68+64x^2+256x^4}$. Let's denote $f(x)=68+64x^2+256x^4$. Then, the numerator is $2+\\sqrt{f(x)}$. Since $f(x)$ is a quartic function, it can have at most two local maxima. Let's find the critical points by taking the derivative: $f'(x)=128x+1024x^3$. Setting $f'(x)=0$, we get $128x+1024x^3=0$. Factoring out $x$, we have $x(128+1024x^2)=0$. Therefore, $x=0$ or $128+1024x^2=0$. Solving the second equation, we get $1024x^2=-128$, so $x^2=-\\frac{128}{1024}=-\\frac{1}{8}$. Since $x^2$ cannot be negative, the only critical point is $x=0$. Therefore, the numerator is $2+\\sqrt{f(x)}$. Since $f(x)$ is a quartic function, we can analyze its behavior. Let's find the second derivative: $f''(x)=128+3072x^2$. Evaluating at $x=0$, we get $f''(0)=128>0$, so $f(x)$ is concave up at $x=0$. Therefore, the numerator is maximized at $x=0$. Therefore, the numerator is $2+\\sqrt{f(0)}=2+\\sqrt{68}=2+\\sqrt{4\\cdot17}=2+2\\sqrt{17}=4+2\\sqrt{17}$.\n\nStep 6: Now, let's analyze the denominator. The denominator is $2+8x^2$. Since $x^2\\ge0$, the denominator is always greater than or equal to $2$. Therefore, the denominator is minimized when $x=0$, in which case the denominator is $2$. Therefore, the maximum value of $k$ is $\\frac{4+2\\sqrt{17}}{2}=2+\\sqrt{17}$.\n\nStep 7: Therefore, the maximum value of $y$ is $\\sqrt{k}=2+\\sqrt{17}$. Therefore, the maximum value of the imaginary part of $z$ is $2+\\sqrt{17}$. Therefore, $m=17$ and $n=2$. Therefore, $m+n=17+2=19$.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{19}",
  "Step 1: Understand the problem\nFlora the frog starts at 0 on the number line and makes a sequence of jumps to the right. Each jump is a positive integer distance m with probability 1/2^m. We need to find the probability that Flora will eventually land at 10.\n\nStep 2: Identify the type of problem\nThis is a problem of a random walk on the number line. The probability of each jump is given by the probability distribution 1/2^m for each positive integer m. We need to find the probability that Flora reaches 10.\n\nStep 3: Consider the possible approaches\nOne approach is to use the generating function method. The generating function for the probability distribution is given by the series 1/2^m, which is a geometric series. The generating function can be used to compute the probability of reaching 10.\n\nStep 4: Compute the generating function\nThe generating function for the probability distribution is given by:\n\nG(x) = \u2211[m=1 to \u221e] (1/2^m) * x^m\n\nThis is a geometric series with first term 1/2 * x and common ratio 1/2 * x. The sum of the series is:\n\nG(x) = (1/2 * x) / (1 - 1/2 * x)\n\nStep 5: Compute the probability of reaching 10\nThe probability of reaching 10 is the coefficient of x^10 in the generating function G(x). To compute this, we can use the binomial expansion formula.\n\nStep 6: Apply the binomial expansion formula\nThe binomial expansion formula states that:\n\n(1 + x)^n = \u2211[k=0 to n] (n choose k) * x^k\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nG(x) = (1/2 * x) / (1 - 1/2 * x) = (1/2 * x) * (1 + 1/2 * x)^(-1)\n\nUsing the binomial expansion formula, we can expand (1 + 1/2 * x)^(-1) as:\n\n(1 + 1/2 * x)^(-1) = \u2211[k=0 to \u221e] (-1)^k * (1/2)^k * x^k\n\nTherefore, the generating function is:\n\nG(x) = (1/2 * x) * \u2211[k=0 to \u221e] (-1)^k * (1/2)^k * x^k\n\nStep 7: Compute the coefficient of x^10\nThe coefficient of x^10 in G(x) is the sum of the terms with k=10. Therefore, we need to compute:\n\n(1/2)^10 * (-1)^10 * (1/2)^10 = (1/2)^20\n\nTherefore, the probability of reaching 10 is (1/2)^20.\n\nStep 8: Simplify the answer\nThe probability is (1/2)^20. To simplify, we can write:\n\n(1/2)^20 = 1 / 2^20 = 1 / 1,048,576\n\nTherefore, the probability is 1/1,048,576.\n\nStep 9: Write the answer as a simplified fraction\nThe probability is 1/1,048,576.\n\nStep 10: Compute m + n\nm = 1, n = 1,048,576. Therefore, m + n = 1 + 1,048,576 = 1,048,577.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{1,048,577}",

The equation is given as \\[\\log_{7x}2023\\cdot \\log_{289x}2023=\\log_{2023x}2023.\\] To solve this, we need to apply properties of logarithms and manipulate the equation to isolate the variable x.\n\nStep 2:  First, let's recall the change of base formula for logarithms: \\[\\log_{a}b = \\frac{\\log_{c}b}{\\log_{c}a}.\\] This formula allows us to change the base of a logarithm to any other base. We can use this to rewrite the given equation with a common base.\n\nStep 3:  Let's denote \\[a = 7x,\\] \\[b = 289x,\\] and \\[c = 2023x.\\] Then, the equation becomes \\[\\frac{\\log_{2023}2023}{\\log_{2023}a}\\cdot \\frac{\\log_{2023}2023}{\\log_{2023}b}=\\frac{\\log_{2023}2023}{\\log_{2023}c}.\\]\n\nStep 4:  Since \\[\\log_{2023}2023=1,\\] the equation simplifies to \\[\\frac{1}{\\log_{2023}a}\\cdot \\frac{1}{\\log_{2023}b}=\\frac{1}{\\log_{2023}c}.\\]\n\nStep 5:  Therefore, \\[\\frac{1}{\\log_{2023}a}\\cdot \\frac{1}{\\log_{2023}b}=\\frac{1}{\\log_{2023}c}.\\]\n\nStep 6:  Multiplying both sides by \\[\\log_{2023}a\\cdot \\log_{2023}b\\cdot \\log_{2023}c,\\] we get \\[\\log_{2023}a\\cdot

We are also given that a cup of orange slices weighs \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of a pound.\n\nStep 2: First, let's convert the mixed number \\(3 \\frac{1}{2}\\) to an improper fraction. \\(3 \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{7}{2}\\) cups. Similarly, \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) cup is already in fraction form.

The total weight of \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of the pizza plus \\(\\frac{7}{2}\\) cups of orange slices is equal to the total weight of \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) of the pizza plus \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) cup of orange slices.

  "Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem describes a triangular array of integers where each row is formed by placing 1s at the ends and interior entries are 1 more than the sum of the two numbers diagonally above it in the previous row. We need to find the units digit of the sum of the 2023 numbers in the 2023rd row.\n\nStep 2: Identify the pattern\nLet's analyze the given rows to identify a pattern. The first row is 1. The second row is 1 1. The third row is 1 3 1. The fourth row is 1 5 5 1. The fifth row is 1 7 11 7 1. We can see that each interior entry is 1 more than the sum of the two numbers diagonally above it in the previous row.\n\nStep 3: Express the interior entries in terms of the previous row\nLet's denote the nth row as r_n. The first and last entries of each row are always 1. The interior entries are 1 more than the sum of the two numbers diagonally above it in the previous row. So, for the interior entry at position k in the nth row, it is 1 + (r_{n-1}[k-1] + r_{n-1}[k]). However, since the first and last entries are 1, the interior entries are 1 more than the sum of the two numbers diagonally above it in the previous row.\n\nStep 4: Compute the interior entries\nLet's compute the interior entries for each row.\n\nFor the second row (n=2), the interior entry is 1 + (1 + 1) = 3.\n\nFor the third row (n=3), the interior entry is 1 + (1 + 3) = 5.\n\nFor the fourth row (n=4), the interior entry is 1 + (1 + 3) = 5.\n\nFor the fifth row (n=5), the interior entry is 1 + (1 + 3) = 5.\n\nWe can see that the interior entries are all 5.\n\nStep 5: Determine the pattern for interior entries\nFrom the above computation, we can see that the interior entries are all 5. Therefore, the interior entries in each row are 5.\n\nStep 6: Compute the sum of the 2023rd row\nSince the interior entries are all 5, the sum of the 2023rd row is 1 + 5 + 5 + ... + 5 + 1. There are 2023 numbers in the 2023rd row, so the sum is 1 + 5 * (2023 - 2) + 1.\n\nStep 7: Simplify the sum\nThe sum is 1 + 5 * 2021 + 1 = 1 + 10105 + 1 = 10106.\n\nStep 8: Find the units digit of the sum\nThe units digit of 10106 is 6.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of the sum of the 2023 numbers in the 2023rd row is 6.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{6}",
  "Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are given a regular icosahedron, which is a regular polyhedron made up of 20 equilateral triangles. We need to find the probability that the distance between two randomly chosen distinct vertices Q and R is greater than the distance between R and another randomly chosen distinct vertex S. The final answer should be in the form m/n, where m and n are relatively prime positive integers, and we need to find m + n.\n\nStep 2: Determine the number of vertices and edges in the icosahedron\nA regular icosahedron has 12 vertices and 30 edges. Each vertex is connected to 5 edges, and each edge connects two vertices.\n\nStep 3: Understand the distance function\nThe distance d(A, B) between two vertices A and B is the minimum number of edges one must traverse to connect A and B. For example, if A and B are adjacent vertices, then d(A, B) = 1. If A and B are two vertices connected by a path of length 2, then d(A, B) = 2.\n\nStep 4: Determine the possible distances between vertices\nSince the icosahedron is a regular polyhedron, the distance between any two vertices can be 1, 2, or 3. The distance 1 corresponds to adjacent vertices, distance 2 corresponds to vertices connected by a path of length 2, and distance 3 corresponds to vertices connected by a path of length 3.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the number of possible pairs (Q, R) and (R, S)\nThere are 12 vertices in the icosahedron. When choosing Q and R, there are 12 choices for Q and 11 choices for R (since Q and R must be distinct). Similarly, when choosing R and S, there are 11 choices for S (since R and S must be distinct). Therefore, the total number of possible pairs (Q, R) and (R, S) is 12 * 11 * 11 = 1452.\n\nStep 6: Calculate the number of pairs (Q, R) and (R, S) where d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\nTo calculate this, we need to consider the different cases based on the distances d(Q, R) and d(R, S).\n\nStep 7: Case 1: d(Q, R) = 1 and d(R, S) = 1\nIn this case, Q and R are adjacent vertices, and R and S are also adjacent vertices. Since the icosahedron is a regular polyhedron, each vertex is connected to 5 edges. Therefore, the number of pairs (Q, R) where Q and R are adjacent is 5 * 11 = 55. Similarly, the number of pairs (R, S) where R and S are adjacent is also 5 * 11 = 55. However, since Q and R are distinct, the number of pairs (Q, R) and (R, S) where both are adjacent is 55 * 55 = 3025. But since Q, R, and S are distinct, the number of such pairs is 55 * 55 = 3025. However, we need to subtract the cases where Q, R, and S are all adjacent, which is 5 * 5 * 5 = 125. Therefore, the number of pairs (Q, R) and (R, S) where both are adjacent is 3025 - 125 = 2900. But since Q, R, and S are distinct, the number of such pairs is 55 * 55 - 125 = 2900. However, we need to subtract the cases where Q, R, and S are all adjacent, which is 5 * 5 * 5 = 125.

  "Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem defines a unique function f on the positive integers such that for any positive integer n, the sum of d times f(n/d) over all divisors d of n equals 1. We need to find the value of f(2023).\n\nStep 2: Analyze the functional equation\nThe functional equation is given by \\[\\sum_{d\\mid n}d\\cdot f\\left(\\frac{n}{d}\\right)=1\\] for all positive integers n. This equation relates the function f at n to the sum of products of divisors d of n and f at n/d.\n\nStep 3: Consider the case when n = 1\nWhen n = 1, the only divisor d is 1. So the equation becomes 1 * f(1) = 1. Therefore, f(1) = 1.\n\nStep 4: Consider the case when n = p^k, where p is a prime and k is a positive integer\nLet's take n = p^k, where p is a prime and k is a positive integer. The divisors d of n are 1, p, p^2, ..., p^k. So the equation becomes \\[1\\cdot f(p^0) + p\\cdot f(p^1) + p^2\\cdot f(p^2) + \\cdots + p^k\\cdot f(p^k) = 1.\\]\n\nStep 5: Let's denote f(p^k) as a_k. Then the equation becomes \\[a_0 + p\\cdot a_1 + p^2\\cdot a_2 + \\cdots + p^k\\cdot a_k = 1.\\]\n\nStep 6: Consider the case when n = p^(k+1)\nNow let's take n = p^(k+1). The divisors d of n are 1, p, p^2, ..., p^k, p^(k+1). So the equation becomes \\[1\\cdot f(p^0) + p\\cdot f(p^1) + p^2\\cdot f(p^2) + \\cdots + p^k\\cdot f(p^k) + p^{k+1}\\cdot f(p^{k+1}) = 1.\\]\n\nStep 7: Let's denote f(p^k) as a_k. Then the equation becomes \\[a_0 + p\\cdot a_1 + p^2\\cdot a_2 + \\cdots + p^k\\cdot a_k + p^{k+1}\\cdot a_{k+1} = 1.\\]\n\nStep 8: Subtract the equation for n = p^k from the equation for n = p^(k+1)\nSubtracting the equation for n = p^k from the equation for n = p^(k+1), we get \\[p^{k+1}\\cdot a_{k+1} = 1 - (a_0 + p\\cdot a_1 + p^2\\cdot a_2 + \\cdots + p^k\\cdot a_k).\\]\n\nStep 9: Let's denote the sum a_0 + p\\cdot a_1 + p^2\\cdot a_2 + \\cdots + p^k\\cdot a_k as S_k. Then the equation becomes \\[p^{k+1}\\cdot a_{k+1} = 1 - S_k.\\]\n\nStep 10: Solve for a_{k+1}\nSolving for a_{k+1}, we get \\[a_{k+1} = \\frac{1 - S_k}{p^{k+1}}.\\]\n\nStep 11: Compute S_k\nTo compute S_k, we can use the recurrence relation. Let's denote S_k as S. Then S = a_0 + p\\cdot a_1 + p^2\\cdot a_2 + \\cdots + p^k\\cdot a_k. Then S - p\\cdot S = a_0 + p\\cdot a_1 + p^2\\cdot a_2 + \\cdots + p^k\\cdot a_k - p\\cdot (a_0 + p\\cdot a_1 + p^2\\cdot a_2 + \\cdots + p^k\\cdot a_k). Simplifying, we get S - p\\cdot S = a_0 + p\\cdot a_1 + p^2\\cdot a_2 + \\cdots + p^k\\cdot a_k - (a_0 + p\\cdot a_1 + p^2\\cdot a_2 + \\cdots + p^k\\cdot a_k) = 0. Therefore, S = p\\cdot S. So S = 0 or S = 1. But S cannot be 0 because a_0 = 1. Therefore, S = 1.\n\nStep 12: Therefore, a_{k+1} = \\frac{1 - 1}{p^{k+1}} = 0.\n\nStep 13: Therefore, a_k = 0 for all k > 0.\n\nStep 14: Therefore, f(p^k) = a_k = 0 for all k > 0.\n\nStep 15: Therefore, f(p) = 0.\n\nStep 16: Therefore, f(n) = 0 for all n > 1.\n\nStep 17: Therefore, f(2023) = 0.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{0}",
  "Step 1: The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs of positive real numbers (a, b) that satisfy the equation (1+2a)(2+2b)(2a+b) = 32ab. To approach this, we can start by expanding the left-hand side of the equation and then simplifying it to a form that can be compared with the right-hand side.\n\nStep 2: First, let's expand the left-hand side of the equation. The expression (1+2a)(2+2b)(2a+b) can be expanded by multiplying the first two factors together and then multiplying the result by the third factor.\n\nStep 3: Multiply the first two factors: (1+2a)(2+2b) = 1(2+2b) + 2a(2+2b) = 2 + 2b + 4a + 4ab = 2 + 4a + 2b + 4ab.\n\nStep 4: Now, multiply this result by the third factor: (2 + 4a + 2b + 4ab)(2a+b) = 2(2a+b) + 4a(2a+b) + 2b(2a+b) + 4ab(2a+b).\n\nStep 5: Expand each term in the product: 2(2a+b) = 4a + 2b, 4a(2a+b) = 8a^2 + 4a^2 = 12a^2, 2b(2a+b) = 4ab + 2b^2, 4ab(2a+b) = 8a^2b + 4ab^2.\n\nStep 6: Combine all the terms: 4a + 2b + 12a^2 + 4ab + 2b^2 + 8a^2b + 4ab^2.\n\nStep 7: Simplify the expression: 4a + 2b + 12a^2 + 4ab + 2b^2 + 8a^2b + 4ab^2 = 12a^2 + 4ab + 2b^2 + 8a^2b + 4ab^2 + 4a + 2b.\n\nStep 8: Factor out common terms: 12a^2 + 4ab + 2b^2 + 8a^2b + 4ab^2 + 4a + 2b = 4a(3a + b + 2b^2 + 2ab) + 2b(2a + b + 2b^2 + 2ab).\n\nStep 9: Factor out 4a and 2b: 4a(3a + b + 2b^2 + 2ab) + 2b(2a + b + 2b^2 + 2ab) = 4a(3a + b + 2b^2 + 2ab) + 2b(2a + b + 2b^2 + 2ab).\n\nStep 10: Factor out (3a + b + 2b^2 + 2ab) from the first term and (2a + b + 2b^2 + 2ab) from the second term: 4a(3a + b + 2b^2 + 2ab) + 2b(2a + b + 2b^2 + 2ab) = (4a)(3a + b + 2b^2 + 2ab) + (2b)(2a + b + 2b^2 + 2ab).\n\nStep 11: Factor out (3a + b + 2b^2 + 2ab) from both terms: (4a + 2b)(3a + b + 2b^2 + 2ab).\n\nStep 12: Now, the left-hand side of the equation is (4a + 2b)(3a + b + 2b^2 + 2ab).

The lattice consists of all subsets of {1, 2, 3, ..., 10} ordered by inclusion. Each element in the lattice is a subset, and the order is defined by subset inclusion.\n\nStep 4: Count the number of paths in the lattice\nThe problem is equivalent to counting the number of paths from the empty set to each element in the lattice, where each step in the path is from a subset to a superset. The length of the path is the number of elements in the subset.\n\nStep 5: Use the formula for the number of paths in a lattice\nThe number of paths from the empty set to a subset of size k is given by the binomial coefficient (10 choose k). Therefore, the total number of paths is the sum of (10 choose k) for k from 0 to 10.\n\nStep 6: Compute the sum\nThe sum is:\n\n(10 choose 0) + (10 choose 1) + (10 choose 2) + ... + (10 choose 10)\n\nThis is a well-known sum, which is equal to 2^10.\n\nStep 7: Find the remainder when divided by 10\nThe remainder when 2^10 is divided by 10 is 4.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{4}",

The degree of the polynomial is 2023, and the denominator is a polynomial of degree 2022. Therefore, the numerator must be a polynomial of degree 2023, and the denominator must be a polynomial of degree 2022.\n\nStep 3: Let's denote the numerator as \\( P(\\tan x) \\) and the denominator as \\( Q(\\tan x) \\). Then, the equation becomes \\( \\tan 2023x = \\frac{P(\\tan x)}{Q(\\tan x)} \\). Since the degree of the numerator is 2023 and the degree of the denominator is 2022, the degree of the numerator must be exactly 2023.\n\nStep 4: The numerator \\( P(\\tan x) \\) is a polynomial of degree 2023. Therefore, it can be written as \\( P(\\tan x) = a_{2023} \\tan^{2023} x + a_{2022} \\tan^{2022} x + \\cdots + a_1 \\tan x \\).\n\nStep 5: Similarly, the denominator \\( Q(\\tan x) \\) is a polynomial of degree 2022.

  "Problem: How many positive perfect squares less than $2023$ are divisible by $5$?\n\nStep 1: To find the number of positive perfect squares less than 2023 that are divisible by 5, we need to identify all perfect squares that are multiples of 5.\n\nStep 2: First, let's recall that a perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer. For example, 1, 4, 9, 16, etc. are perfect squares.\n\nStep 3: Since we are looking for perfect squares divisible by 5, we can start by finding the square of the smallest integer that is a multiple of 5. The smallest multiple of 5 is 5 itself, so the square of 5 is 25. However, 25 is less than 2023, so it is a valid perfect square.\n\nStep 4: Next, we need to find the next perfect square that is a multiple of 5. To do this, we can find the next multiple of 5 after 5, which is 10. The square of 10 is 100, which is also less than 2023. So, 100 is another perfect square divisible by 5.\n\nStep 5: Continuing this pattern, we can find the next multiple of 5, which is 15. The square of 15 is 225, which is less than 2023. So, 225 is another perfect square divisible by 5.\n\nStep 6: The next multiple of 5 is 20. The square of 20 is 400, which is less than 2023. So, 400 is another perfect square divisible by 5.\n\nStep 7: The next multiple of 5 is 25. The square of 25 is 625, which is less than 2023. So, 625 is another perfect square divisible by 5.\n\nStep 8: The next multiple of 5 is 30. The square of 30 is 900, which is less than 2023. So, 900 is another perfect square divisible by 5.\n\nStep 9: The next multiple of 5 is 35. The square of 35 is 1225, which is less than 2023. So, 1225 is another perfect square divisible by 5.\n\nStep 10: The next multiple of 5 is 40. The square of 40 is 1600, which is less than 2023. So, 1600 is another perfect square divisible by 5.\n\nStep 11: The next multiple of 5 is 45. The square of 45 is 2025, which is greater than 2023. So, 2025 is not a perfect square less than 2023.\n\nStep 12: Therefore, the perfect squares less than 2023 that are divisible by 5 are 25, 100, 225, 400, 625, 900, and 1225.\n\nStep 13: Counting these numbers, we have 7 perfect squares less than 2023 that are divisible by 5.\n\nStep 14: Therefore, the number of positive perfect squares less than 2023 that are divisible by 5 is 7.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{7}",
  "Problem: How many digits are in the base-ten representation of \\(8^5 \\cdot 5^{10} \\cdot 15^5\\)? Step 1: To find the number of digits in the base-ten representation of \\(8^5 \\cdot 5^{10} \\cdot 15^5\\), we first need to compute the value of this expression. Step 2: Let's break down the expression into its prime factors. First, let's factorize each number: \\(8 = 2^3\\), \\(5 = 5\\), and \\(15 = 3 \\cdot 5\\). Step 3: So, the expression can be written as \\((2^3)^5 \\cdot 5^{10} \\cdot (3 \\cdot 5)^5\\). Step 4: Simplifying this, we get \\(2^{15} \\cdot 5^{10} \\cdot 3^5 \\cdot 5^5\\). Step 5: Combining the powers of 5, we have \\(2^{15} \\cdot 5^{10+5} \\cdot 3^5\\), which simplifies to \\(2^{15} \\cdot 5^{15} \\cdot 3^5\\). Step 6: Now, we need to compute the value of \\(2^{15} \\cdot 5^{15} \\cdot 3^5\\). Step 7: Let's compute each part separately. First, \\(2^{15}\\) is \\(32768\\). Step 8: Next, \\(5^{15}\\) is \\(9,765,625\\). Step 9: Then, \\(3^5\\) is \\(243\\). Step 10: Multiplying these together, we get \\(32768 \\cdot 9,765,625 \\cdot 243\\). Step 11: Let's compute the multiplication step by step. First, \\(32768 \\cdot 9,765,625 = 320,000,000,000\\). Step 12: Then, multiplying \\(320,000,000,000\\) by \\(243\\), we get \\(77,760,000,000,000\\). Step 13: Therefore, the value of \\(8^5 \\cdot 5^{10} \\cdot 15^5\\) is \\(77,760,000,000,000\\).

  "Step 1: Understand the problem\nJanet rolls a standard 6-sided die 4 times and keeps a running total of the numbers she rolls. We need to find the probability that at some point, her running total will equal 3. The final answer should be in the form m/n, where m and n are relatively prime positive integers. Then, we need to find m + n.\n\nStep 2: Determine the possible outcomes for each roll\nEach roll of the die can result in a number from 1 to 6. Since Janet rolls the die 4 times, the total number of possible outcomes is 6^4 = 1296.\n\nStep 3: Identify the cases where the running total equals 3\nThe running total can equal 3 after the first roll, the second roll, the third roll, or the fourth roll. We need to consider each case separately.\n\nCase 1: Running total equals 3 after the first roll\nThe only possible outcome for the first roll is 3. The probability of rolling a 3 on the first roll is 1/6.\n\nCase 2: Running total equals 3 after the second roll\nThe running total after the first roll can be 1, 2, or 3. If it's 1, the second roll must be 2. If it's 2, the second roll must be 1. If it's 3, the second roll must be 0 (which is not possible since the die has no 0). So, the only possible outcomes are (1,2) and (2,1). The probability of each is (1/6)^2 = 1/36. Since there are two possible outcomes, the total probability is 2/36 = 1/18.\n\nCase 3: Running total equals 3 after the third roll\nThe running total after the first two rolls can be 1, 2, or 3. If it's 1, the third roll must be 2. If it's 2, the third roll must be 1. If it's 3, the third roll must be 0 (which is not possible). So, the only possible outcomes are (1,2,1), (2,1,1), (1,1,2), (1,2,2), (2,1,2), (2,2,1), (1,1,1,1), (1,1,1,2), (1,1,2,1), (1,2,1,1), (2,1,1,1), (2,1,1,2), (2,1,2,1), (2,2,1,1), (2,2,1,2), (2,2,2,1), (2,2,2,2). The probability of each is (1/6)^3 = 1/216. Since there are 16 possible outcomes, the total probability is 16/216 = 4/54 = 2/27.\n\nCase 4: Running total equals 3 after the fourth roll\nThe running total after the first three rolls can be 1, 2, or 3. If it's 1, the fourth roll must be 2. If it's 2, the fourth roll must be 1. If it's 3, the fourth roll must be 0 (which is not possible). So, the only possible outcomes are (1,2,1,2), (2,1,1,2), (1,1,2,1), (1,2,2,1), (2,1,2,1), (2,2,1,1), (1,1,1,2), (1,1,2,1), (1,2,1,1), (2,1,1,1), (2,1,1,2), (2,1,2,1), (2,2,1,1), (2,2,1,2), (2,2,2,1), (2,2,2,2). The probability of each is (1/6)^4 = 1/1296. Since there are 16 possible outcomes, the total probability is 16/1296 = 4/324 = 1/81.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the total probability\nThe total probability is the sum of the probabilities from each case: 1/6 + 1/18 + 2/27 + 1/81.\n\nTo add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 6, 18, 27, and 81 is 162. So, we can convert each fraction to have a denominator of 162.\n\n1/6 = 27/162\n\n1/18 = 9/162\n\n2/27 = 12/162\n\n1/81 = 2/162\n\nNow, we can add the fractions:\n\n27/162 + 9/162 + 12/162 + 2/162 = 50/162\n\nTherefore, the total probability is 50/162.\n\nStep 5: Simplify the fraction\nThe fraction 50/162 can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor. The GCD of 50 and 162 is 2. So, dividing both by 2:\n\n50/2 = 25\n\n162/2 = 81\n\nSo, the simplified fraction is 25/81.\n\nTherefore, the probability that at some point, Janet's running total will equal 3 is 25/81.\n\nStep 6: Find m + n\nThe final answer is in the form m/n, where m = 25 and n = 81. Therefore, m + n = 25 + 81 = 106.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{106}",
  "Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are given that points A and B lie on the graph of y = log2(x). The midpoint of the line segment AB is (6, 2). We need to find the positive difference between the x-coordinates of A and B. Then, we have to express this difference in the form m\u221an, where m and n are relatively prime positive integers, and find m + n.\n\nStep 2: Recall the midpoint formula\nThe midpoint of a line segment with endpoints (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2). In this case, the midpoint is (6, 2), so we have (x1 + x2)/2 = 6 and (y1 + y2)/2 = 2.\n\nStep 3: Express y1 and y2 in terms of x1 and x2\nSince points A and B lie on the graph of y = log2(x), we can write y1 = log2(x1) and y2 = log2(x2).\n\nStep 4: Substitute y1 and y2 into the midpoint formula\nSubstituting y1 = log2(x1) and y2 = log2(x2) into the midpoint formula, we get:\n\n((x1 + x2)/2, (log2(x1) + log2(x2))/2) = (6, 2)\n\nSo, (x1 + x2)/2 = 6 and (log2(x1) + log2(x2))/2 = 2.\n\nStep 5: Simplify the second equation\nThe second equation can be rewritten as log2(x1) + log2(x2) = 4. Using the logarithm property log2(x1) + log2(x2) = log2(x1 * x2), we have log2(x1 * x2) = 4.\n\nStep 6: Solve for x1 * x2\nFrom log2(x1 * x2) = 4, we can rewrite this as x1 * x2 = 2^4 = 16.\n\nStep 7: Solve the system of equations\nWe have two equations:\n\n1) (x1 + x2)/2 = 6 => x1 + x2 = 12\n\n2) x1 * x2 = 16\n\nWe can solve this system of equations to find x1 and x2.\n\nStep 8: Solve the quadratic equation\nLet's denote x1 = a and x2 = b. Then, the equations become:\n\na + b = 12\n\nab = 16\n\nWe can solve this system by substituting b = 12 - a into the second equation:\n\na(12 - a) = 16\n\nExpanding, we get:\n\n12a - a^2 = 16\n\nRearranging, we get:\n\na^2 - 12a + 16 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in a.\n\nStep 9: Solve the quadratic equation\nLet's solve the quadratic equation a^2 - 12a + 16 = 0.\n\nThe quadratic formula is a = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a, where a = 1, b = -12, c = 16.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\na = (12 \u00b1 \u221a((-12)^2 - 4*1*16)) / 2*1\n\na = (12 \u00b1 \u221a(144 - 64)) / 2\n\na = (12 \u00b1 \u221a80) / 2\n\na = (12 \u00b1 4\u221a5) / 2\n\na = 6 \u00b1 2\u221a5\n\nSo, the two possible values for a are 6 + 2\u221a5 and 6 - 2\u221a5.\n\nStep 10: Find the corresponding values of b\nIf a = 6 + 2\u221a5, then b = 12 - a = 12 - (6 + 2\u221a5) = 6 - 2\u221a5.\n\nIf a = 6 - 2\u221a5, then b = 12 - a = 12 - (6 - 2\u221a5) = 6 + 2\u221a5.\n\nStep 11: Compute the positive difference between a and b\nThe positive difference between a and b is |a - b|.\n\nIf a = 6 + 2\u221a5 and b = 6 - 2\u221a5, then |a - b| = |(6 + 2\u221a5) - (6 - 2\u221a5)| = |4\u221a5| = 4\u221a5.\n\nIf a = 6 - 2\u221a5 and b = 6 + 2\u221a5, then |a - b| = |(6 - 2\u221a5) - (6 + 2\u221a5)| = |-4\u221a5| = 4\u221a5.\n\nSo, in both cases, the positive difference is 4\u221a5.\n\nStep 12: Express the difference in the form m\u221an\nThe positive difference is 4\u221a5. Here, m = 4 and n = 5. Since 4 and 5 are relatively prime, the difference is already in the required form.\n\nStep 13: Find m + n\nm + n = 4 + 5 = 9.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 9.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{9}",
  "Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem asks us to find the number of dates in the year 2023 where each digit (0-9) appears an even number of times in the 8-digit display of the date. The 8-digit display is in the format YYYYMMDD, where YYYY is the 4-digit year, MM is the 2-digit month, and DD is the 2-digit day.\n\nStep 2: Determine the total number of dates in 2023\nSince the year is 2023, the month can be 1 to 12, and the day can be 1 to 31 for each month. However, not all months have 31 days. So, we need to consider the number of days in each month.\n\n- January, March, May, July, August, October, December: 31 days\n- February: 28 days (29 in leap years, but 2023 is not a leap year)\n- April, June, September, November: 30 days\n\nTherefore, the total number of days in 2023 is:\n31 + 28 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 = 365\n\nSo, there are 365 days in 2023.\n\nStep 3: Determine the number of dates where each digit appears an even number of times\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider the possible combinations of digits that appear an even number of times in the 8-digit display.\n\nSince each digit must appear an even number of times, we can use the concept of parity. Let's denote the number of times each digit appears as follows:\n\n- Let x be the number of times 0 appears\n- Let y be the number of times 1 appears\n- Let z be the number of times 2 appears\n- Let w be the number of times 3 appears\n- Let v be the number of times 4 appears\n- Let u be the number of times 5 appears\n- Let t be the number of times 6 appears\n- Let s be the number of times 7 appears\n- Let r be the number of times 8 appears\n- Let q be the number of times 9 appears\n\nSince each digit must appear an even number of times, we have:\n\nx, y, z, w, v, u, t, s, r, q \u2208 {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}\n\nHowever, since the total number of digits is 8, the sum of all these numbers must be 8:\n\nx + y + z + w + v + u + t + s + r + q = 8\n\nAdditionally, since each digit can appear at most 8 times, we have:\n\nx \u2264 8, y \u2264 8, z \u2264 8, w \u2264 8, v \u2264 8, u \u2264 8, t \u2264 8, s \u2264 8, r \u2264 8, q \u2264 8\n\nBut since each digit must appear an even number of times, we can write:\n\nx = 2k1, y = 2k2, z = 2k3, w = 2k4, v = 2k5, u = 2k6, t = 2k7, s = 2k8, r = 2k9, q = 2k10\n\nwhere k1, k2, ..., k10 are non-negative integers.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation:\n\n2k1 + 2k2 + 2k3 + 2k4 + 2k5 + 2k6 + 2k7 + 2k8 + 2k9 + 2k10 = 8\n\nDividing both sides by 2:\n\nk1 + k2 + k3 + k4 + k5 + k6 + k7 + k8 + k9 + k10 = 4\n\nThis is a classic problem of distributing 4 identical items into 10 distinct bins, where each bin can hold any number of items. This is equivalent to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation:\n\nk1 + k2 + k3 + k4 + k5 + k6 + k7 + k8 + k9 + k10 = 4\n\nUsing the stars and bars method, the number of solutions is:\n\nC(4 + 10 - 1, 10 - 1) = C(13, 9) = 286\n\nTherefore, there are 286 possible combinations of digits that appear an even number of times.\n\nHowever, not all these combinations are valid dates. We need to check which combinations correspond to valid dates in 2023.\n\nStep 4: Check which combinations correspond to valid dates\nSince each digit must appear an even number of times, we can generate all possible combinations and check which ones correspond to valid dates.\n\nHowever, this approach is computationally expensive. A more efficient approach is to use the fact that the digits 0-9 must appear an even number of times. Therefore, the number of times each digit appears must be even.\n\nLet's consider the possible numbers of times each digit appears:\n\n- 0: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8\n- 1: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8\n- 2: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8\n- 3: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8\n- 4: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8\n- 5: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8\n- 6: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8\n- 7: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8\n- 8: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8\n- 9: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8\n\nTherefore, the number of times each digit appears must be even. Let's denote the number of times each digit appears as follows:\n\n- Let x be the number of times 0 appears\n- Let y be the number of times 1 appears\n- Let z be the number of times 2 appears\n- Let w be the number of times 3 appears\n- Let v be the number of times 4 appears\n- Let u be the number of times 5 appears\n- Let t be the number of times 6 appears\n- Let s be the number of times 7 appears\n- Let r be the number of times 8 appears\n- Let q be the number of times 9 appears\n\nSince each digit must appear an even number of times, we have:\n\nx, y, z, w, v, u, t, s, r, q \u2208 {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}\n\nTherefore, the number of possible combinations is:\n\n(5^10) / (2^10) = 5^10 / 1024\n\nHowever, this includes combinations where some digits appear 0 times. But in a date, each digit must appear at least once. Therefore, we need to subtract the combinations where some digits appear 0 times.\n\nLet's consider the number of combinations where some digits appear 0 times. Let's denote the number of digits that appear 0 times as k. Then, the number of combinations is:\n\nC(10, k) * (5^10 - 5^k)\n\nTherefore, the total number of combinations is:\n\n(5^10) / (2^10) - C(10, 1) * (5^10 - 5^1) / (2^10) + C(10, 2) * (5^10 - 5^2) / (2^10) - ... + (-1)^9 * C(10, 9) * (5^10 - 5^9) / (2^10)\n\nHowever, this is a complicated expression.

Therefore, the number of times each digit appears must be even.\n\nLet's consider the possible numbers of times each digit appears:\n\n- 0: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8\n- 1: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8\n- 2: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8\n- 3: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8\n- 4: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8\n- 5: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8\n- 6: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8\n- 7: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8\n- 8: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8\n- 9: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8\n\nTherefore, the number of times each digit appears must be even. Let's denote the number of times each digit appears as follows:\n\n- Let x be the number of times 0 appears\n- Let y be the number of times 1 appears\n- Let z be the number of times 2 appears\n- Let w be the number of times 3 appears\n- Let v be the number of times 4 appears\n- Let u be the number of times 5 appears\n- Let t be the number of times 6 appears\n- Let s be the number of times 7 appears\n- Let r be the number of times 8 appears\n- Let q be the number of times 9 appears\n\nSince each digit must appear an even number of times, we have:\n\nx, y, z, w, v, u, t, s, r, q \u2208 {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}\n\nTherefore, the number of possible combinations is:\n\n(5^10) / (2^10) = 5^10 / 1024\n\nHowever, this includes combinations where some digits appear 0 times.

Let's denote the number of times each digit appears as follows:\n\n- Let x be the number of times 0 appears\n- Let y be the number of times 1 appears\n- Let z be the number of times 2 appears\n- Let w be the number of times 3 appears\n- Let v be the number of times 4 appears\n- Let u be the number of times 5 appears\n- Let t be the number of times 6 appears\n- Let s be the number of times 7 appears\n- Let r be the number of times 8 appears\n- Let q be the number of times 9 appears\n\nSince each digit must appear an even number of times, we have:\n\nx, y, z, w, v, u, t, s, r, q \u2208 {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}\n\nTherefore, the number of possible combinations is:\n\n(5^10) / (2^10) = 5^10 / 1024\n\nHowever, this includes combinations where some digits appear 0 times. But in a date, each digit must appear at least once. Therefore, we need to subtract the combinations where some digits appear 0 times.\n\nLet's consider the number of combinations where some digits appear 0 times. Let's denote the number of digits that appear 0 times as k. Then, the number of combinations is:\n\nC(10, k) * (5^10 - 5^k)\n\nTherefore, the total number of combinations is:\n\n(5^10) / (2^10) - C(10, 1) * (5^10 - 5^1) / (2",
  "Step 1: Let's denote the current mean of Maureen's quiz scores as \\( \\mu \\) and the total number of quizzes she has taken so far as \\( n \\). The total score she has so far is \\( n \\mu \\).\n\nStep 2: When Maureen scores an 11 on the next quiz, her new total number of quizzes becomes \\( n + 1 \\), and her new total score is \\( n \\mu + 11 \\). The new mean is \\( \\frac{n \\mu + 11}{n + 1} \\). According to the problem, this new mean is \\( \\mu + 1 \\). So, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{n \\mu + 11}{n + 1} = \\mu + 1 \\]\n\nStep 3: Similarly, if she scores an 11 on each of the next three quizzes, her new total number of quizzes becomes \\( n + 3 \\), and her new total score is \\( n \\mu + 3 \\times 11 = n \\mu + 33 \\). The new mean is \\( \\frac{n \\mu + 33}{n + 3} \\). According to the problem, this new mean is \\( \\mu + 2 \\). So, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{n \\mu + 33}{n + 3} = \\mu + 2 \\]\n\nStep 4: Let's solve the first equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{n \\mu + 11}{n + 1} = \\mu + 1 \\]\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( n + 1 \\):\n\n\\[ n \\mu + 11 = (n + 1)(\\mu + 1) \\]\n\nExpand the right side:\n\n\\[ n \\mu + 11 = n \\mu + n + \\mu + 1 \\]\n\nSubtract \\( n \\mu \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[ 11 = n + \\mu + 1 \\]\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 10 = n + \\mu \\]\n\nSo, \\( n + \\mu = 10 \\).\n\nStep 5: Let's solve the second equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{n \\mu + 33}{n + 3} = \\mu + 2 \\]\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( n + 3 \\):\n\n\\[ n \\mu + 33 = (n + 3)(\\mu + 2) \\]\n\nExpand the right side:\n\n\\[ n \\mu + 33 = n \\mu + 2n + 3\\mu + 6 \\]\n\nSubtract \\( n \\mu \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[ 33 = 2n + 3\\mu + 6 \\]\n\nSubtract 6 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 27 = 2n + 3\\mu \\]\n\nSubtract 2n from both sides:\n\n\\[ 27 - 2n = 3\\mu \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\n\\[ \\frac{27 - 2n}{3} = \\mu \\]\n\nSo, \\( \\mu = \\frac{27 - 2n}{3} \\).\n\nStep 6: Substitute \\( n + \\mu = 10 \\) into \\( \\mu = \\frac{27 - 2n}{3} \\):\n\n\\[ n + \\frac{27 - 2n}{3} = 10 \\]\n\nMultiply both sides by 3:\n\n\\[ 3n + 27 - 2n = 30 \\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[ n + 27 = 30 \\]\n\nSubtract 27 from both sides:\n\n\\[ n = 3 \\]\n\nStep 7: Substitute \\( n = 3 \\) into \\( n + \\mu = 10 \\):\n\n\\[ 3 + \\mu = 10 \\]\n\nSubtract 3 from both sides:\n\n\\[ \\mu = 7 \\]\n\nTherefore, the current mean of Maureen's quiz scores is 7.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{7}",
  "Step 1:  The problem states that Mrs. Jones has four identical glasses and fills the first three completely but only fills the fourth glass $\\frac{1}{3}$ full. We need to find the fraction of juice she must pour from each of the first three glasses into the fourth glass so that all four glasses have the same amount of juice.\nStep 2:  Let's denote the total capacity of each glass as $x$. Therefore, the total amount of juice in the first three glasses is $3x$, and the total amount in the fourth glass is $\\frac{1}{3}x$. So, the total amount of juice in all four glasses is $3x + \\frac{1}{3}x = \\frac{10}{3}x$.\nStep 3:  To distribute the juice evenly among the four glasses, we need to find the amount each glass should have. Since the total amount is $\\frac{10}{3}x$ and there are four glasses, each glass should have $\\frac{10}{3}x \\div 4 = \\frac{10}{3}x \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{10}{12}x = \\frac{5}{6}x$.\nStep 4:  Therefore, the amount each glass should have is $\\frac{5}{6}x$. Now, we need to find how much juice needs to be poured from each of the first three glasses into the fourth glass to make the fourth glass have $\\frac{5}{6}x$.\nStep 5:  Let's denote the amount to be poured from each of the first three glasses as $y$. Then, the amount left in each of the first three glasses after pouring is $x - y$. The total amount poured into the fourth glass is $3y$, and the total amount in the fourth glass after pouring is $\\frac{1}{3}x + 3y$.\nStep 6:  Since the fourth glass should have $\\frac{5}{6}x$, we can set up the equation: $\\frac{1}{3}x + 3y = \\frac{5}{6}x$.\nStep 7:  Solving for $y$, we have:\n\\[3y = \\frac{5}{6}x - \\frac{1}{3}x = \\frac{5}{6}x - \\frac{2}{6}x = \\frac{3}{6}x = \\frac{1}{2}x\\]\n\\[y = \\frac{1}{2}x \\div 3 = \\frac{1}{2}x \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{6}x\\]\nStep 8:  Therefore, the amount to be poured from each of the first three glasses into the fourth glass is $\\frac{1}{6}x$. So, the fraction of a glass that must be poured from each of the first three glasses into the fourth glass is $\\frac{1}{6}$.\nStep 9:  Hence, the final answer is $\\frac{1}{6}$, and $m+n = 1+6 = 7$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7}$",
  "Step 1:  The problem involves finding the slope of the line passing through the two points of intersection between two circles in the xy-plane. The first circle has a radius of 4 and its center lies on the positive x-axis, tangent to the y-axis at the origin. The second circle has a radius of 10 and its center is on the positive y-axis, tangent to the x-axis at the origin. We need to find the slope of the line connecting these two points of intersection.\nStep 2:  To approach this problem, we can start by visualizing the positions of the two circles. Since the first circle is tangent to the y-axis at the origin and has a radius of 4, its center must be at (4,0). Similarly, the second circle is tangent to the x-axis at the origin and has a radius of 10, so its center is at (0,10).\nStep 3:  The two circles intersect at two points, and we need to find the slope of the line passing through these two points. The slope of a line passing through two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by the formula m = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1).\nStep 4:  Therefore, we need to find the coordinates of the two points of intersection and then compute the slope using the formula.\n\nStep 5:  To find the points of intersection, we can set up the equations for the two circles and solve for their common points. The equation of a circle with center (h, k) and radius r is (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2.\n\nStep 6:  For the first circle with center (4,0) and radius 4, the equation is (x - 4)^2 + y^2 = 16. For the second circle with center (0,10) and radius 10, the equation is x^2 + (y - 10)^2 = 100.\n\nStep 7:  We need to solve the system of equations formed by these two circle equations to find the points of intersection.\n\nStep 8:  Let's denote the coordinates of the first point of intersection as (x1, y1) and the second point as (x2, y2). Then, we can substitute these coordinates into both circle equations and solve for x1, y1, x2, and y2.\n\nStep 9:  Substituting (x1, y1) into the first circle equation: (x1 - 4)^2 + y1^2 = 16. Substituting (x2, y2) into the second circle equation: x2^2 + (y2 - 10)^2 = 100.\n\nStep 10:  Similarly, substituting (x1, y1) into the second circle equation: x1^2 + (y1 - 10)^2 = 100. Substituting (x2, y2) into the first circle equation: (x2 - 4)^2 + y2^2 = 16.\n\nStep 11:  We have four equations now:\n\n1. (x1 - 4)^2 + y1^2 = 16\n2. x2^2 + (y2 - 10)^2 = 100\n3. x1^2 + (y1 - 10)^2 = 100\n4. (x2 - 4)^2 + y2^2 = 16\n\nStep 12:  We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the coordinates of the two points of intersection.\n\nStep 13:  Let's start by solving equations 1 and 2. Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2:\n\nx2^2 + (y2 - 10)^2 - ((x1 - 4)^2 + y1^2) = 100 - 16\n\nSimplifying:\n\nx2^2 - (x1 - 4)^2 + (y2 - 10)^2 - y1^2 = 84\n\nExpanding:\n\nx2^2 - (x1^2 - 8x1 + 16) + (y2^2 - 20y2 + 100) - y1^2 = 84\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nx2^2 - x1^2 + 8x1 - 16 + y2^2 - 20y2 + 100 - y1^2 = 84\n\nSimplify further:\n\nx2^2 - x1^2 + 8x1 + y2^2 - 20y2 - y1^2 + 84 = 0\n\nSimilarly, subtracting equation 3 from equation 4:\n\n(x2 - 4)^2 + y2^2 - (x1^2 + (y1 - 10)^2) = 16 - 100\n\nSimplifying:\n\n(x2 - 4)^2 + y2^2 - x1^2 - (y1^2 - 20y1 + 100) = -84\n\nExpanding:\n\nx2^2 - 8x2 + 16 + y2^2 - x1^2 - y1^2 + 20y1 - 100 = -84\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nx2^2 - x1^2 + y2^2 - y1^2 - 8x2 + 20y1 - 84 = 0\n\nNow we have two equations:\n\n1. x2^2 - x1^2 + 8x1 + y2^2 - 20y2 - y1^2 + 84 = 0\n2. x2^2 - x1^2 + y2^2 - y1^2 - 8x2 + 20y1 - 84 = 0\n\nSubtracting equation 2 from equation 1:\n\n(8x1 - (-8x2)) + (-20y2 + 20y1) + 84 - (-84) = 0\n\nSimplifying:\n\n8x1 + 8x2 - 20y2 + 20y1 + 168 = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n8(x1 + x2) - 20(y2 - y1) + 168 = 0\n\nDivide by 4:\n\n2(x1 + x2) - 5(y2 - y1) + 42 = 0\n\nLet's denote x1 + x2 = a and y2 - y1 = b.

  "Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe need to find the maximum area of an isosceles trapezoid with legs of length 1 and one base twice as long as the other. Then, we have to express the area as a fraction m/n where m and n are relatively prime, and finally compute m^2 + n^2.\n\nStep 2: Recall the formula for the area of a trapezoid\nThe area of a trapezoid is given by the formula: Area = (1/2) * (sum of the lengths of the bases) * height.\n\nStep 3: Define the variables\nLet's denote the length of the shorter base as x. Since the longer base is twice as long as the shorter one, the longer base is 2x. The legs are of length 1.\n\nStep 4: Determine the height\nSince the trapezoid is isosceles, the legs are equal in length. The height can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. Let's denote the height as h. Then, the distance between the two bases is also h. Let's denote the midpoint of the shorter base as point A, the midpoint of the longer base as point B, and the foot of the leg as point C. Since the trapezoid is isosceles, the legs are equal in length, so AC = BC = 1. The height h is the distance between points A and C. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have h^2 + (x/2)^2 = 1^2. Therefore, h = sqrt(1 - (x/2)^2).\n\nStep 5: Express the area in terms of x\nThe area of the trapezoid is (1/2) * (x + 2x) * sqrt(1 - (x/2)^2) = (3/2)x * sqrt(1 - (x/2)^2).\n\nStep 6: Find the maximum area\nTo find the maximum area, we need to find the value of x that maximizes the expression (3/2)x * sqrt(1 - (x/2)^2). Since the expression is a product of x and sqrt(1 - (x/2)^2), we can use calculus to find the maximum.\n\nStep 7: Differentiate the area with respect to x\nLet's denote the area as A(x) = (3/2)x * sqrt(1 - (x/2)^2). Then, A'(x) = (3/2) * [sqrt(1 - (x/2)^2) + x * (1/2) * (1 - (x/2)^2)^(-1/2) * (-x/2)]. Simplifying, A'(x) = (3/2) * [sqrt(1 - (x/2)^2) - (x^2/4) / sqrt(1 - (x/2)^2)]. Therefore, A'(x) = (3/2) * [1 - (x^2/4)] / sqrt(1 - (x/2)^2).\n\nStep 8: Set the derivative equal to zero\nTo find the maximum, we set A'(x) = 0. Therefore, (3/2) * [1 - (x^2/4)] / sqrt(1 - (x/2)^2) = 0. Since the denominator is non-zero, the numerator must be zero. Therefore, 1 - (x^2/4) = 0. Solving for x, we get x^2 = 4, so x = \u00b12. Since x is the length of a base, it must be positive, so x = 2.\n\nStep 9: Check the second derivative\nTo confirm that x = 2 is a maximum, we need to check the second derivative. Let's compute A''(x). Differentiating A'(x) = (3/2) * [1 - (x^2/4)] / sqrt(1 - (x/2)^2) with respect to x, we get A''(x) = (3/2) * [(-x/2) / sqrt(1 - (x/2)^2) - (1 - (x^2/4)) * (-x/4) / (1 - (x/2)^2)^3/2]. Simplifying, A''(x) = (3/2) * [(-x/2) / sqrt(1 - (x/2)^2) + (x^3/16) / sqrt(1 - (x/2)^2)^3]. Therefore, A''(x) = (3/2) * [(-x/2) + (x^3/16) / sqrt(1 - (x/2)^2)^2]. At x = 2, A''(2) = (3/2) * [(-2/2) + (2^3/16) / sqrt(1 - (2/2)^2)^2] = (3/2) * [-1 + 4/4] = (3/2) * 0 = 0. Since the second derivative is zero, we need to check the sign of the first derivative around x = 2. Let's compute A'(x) for x close to 2. Let's compute A'(2) = (3/2) * [1 - (2^2/4)] / sqrt(1 - (2/2)^2) = (3/2) * [1 - 1] / 1 = 0. Therefore, the first derivative is zero at x = 2. Since the second derivative is zero, we need to check the sign of the first derivative around x = 2. Let's compute A'(x) for x close to 2. Let's compute A'(2 + \u03b5) = (3/2) * [1 - ((2 + \u03b5)^2/4)] / sqrt(1 - ((2 + \u03b5)/2)^2). Let's expand the numerator and denominator. The numerator is 1 - ((2 + \u03b5)^2/4) = 1 - (4 + 4\u03b5 + \u03b5^2)/4 = 1 - 1 - \u03b5 - \u03b5^2/4 = -\u03b5 - \u03b5^2/4. The denominator is sqrt(1 - ((2 + \u03b5)/2)^2) = sqrt(1 - (1 + \u03b5/2)^2) = sqrt(1 - 1 - \u03b5 - \u03b5^2/4) = sqrt(-\u03b5 - \u03b5^2/4). Therefore, A'(2 + \u03b5) = (3/2) * (-\u03b5 - \u03b5^2/4) / sqrt(-\u03b5 - \u03b5^2/4). Let's compute the sign of the numerator and denominator. The numerator is -\u03b5 - \u03b5^2/4. For \u03b5 > 0, the numerator is negative. The denominator is sqrt(-\u03b5 - \u03b5^2/4). For \u03b5 > 0, the denominator is sqrt(-\u03b5 - \u03b5^2/4) = sqrt(-\u03b5(1 + \u03b5/4)) = sqrt(-\u03b5) * sqrt(1 + \u03b5/4). Since \u03b5 > 0, sqrt(-\u03b5) is imaginary, so the denominator is imaginary. Therefore, the denominator is imaginary, so the entire expression is imaginary. Therefore, the first derivative is imaginary for \u03b5 > 0. Therefore, the first derivative changes sign from positive to negative at x = 2. Therefore, x = 2 is a local maximum.\n\nStep 10: Compute the maximum area\nTherefore, the maximum area is A(2) = (3/2) * 2 * sqrt(1 - (2/2)^2) = (3/2) * 2 * sqrt(1 - 1) = (3/2) * 2 * 0 = 0.

  "Step 1: Understand the problem and the binary operation defined.\nThe problem defines a binary operation \u2297 on complex numbers u and v as u \u2297 v = ac + bdi, where u = a + bi and v = c + di.

  "Step 1: Let's denote the edge lengths of the rectangular box P as a, b, and c. We are given that the sum of the lengths of all 12 edges is 13. Since each edge is counted twice (once for each of the two faces it belongs to), the total number of edges is 12. Therefore, the sum of the lengths of all edges is 2(a + b + c) = 13. So, a + b + c = 6.5.\n\nStep 2: The areas of all 6 faces of P is given as 11/2. Each face is a rectangle with two edges of lengths a, b, and c. The total area is 2(ab + bc + ca) = 11/2. So, ab + bc + ca = 11/4.\n\nStep 3: The volume of P is given as 1/2. The volume of a rectangular box is abc. Therefore, abc = 1/2.\n\nStep 4: We need to find the length of the longest interior diagonal connecting two vertices of P. The longest diagonal is the space diagonal, which can be found using the formula sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2).\n\nStep 5: To find the length of the space diagonal, we need to find the values of a, b, and c.

Let's denote l = b\u00b2. Then, l = (13b + 11)/2.\n\nStep 28: Therefore, 2l = 13b + 11.\n\nStep 29: Rearrange the equation: 13b = 2l - 11.\n\nStep 30: Divide by 13: b = (2l - 11)/13.\n\nStep 31: Since a + b + c = 6.5, we have a + b + (6.5 - a - b) = 6.5.\n\nStep 32: Simplify the equation: 6.5 = 6.5.\n\nStep 33: Therefore, the equation is true for any a and b.\n\nStep 34: However, we also have the equation abc = 1/2. Let's substitute c = 6.5 - a - b into this equation: ab(6.5 - a - b) = 1/2.\n\nStep 35: Expand the equation: 6.5ab - a\u00b2b - ab\u00b2 = 1/2.\n\nStep 36: Rearrange the equation: a\u00b2b + ab\u00b2 - 6.5ab + 1/2 = 0.\n\nStep 37: Factor out ab: ab(a + b - 6.5) + 1/2 = 0.\n\nStep 38: Let's denote m = a + b.

  "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) of integers such that the polynomial x\u00b3 + ax\u00b2 + bx + 6 has three distinct integer roots.\n\nFirst, let's recall that a cubic polynomial with three distinct roots can be written in the form:\n\nx\u00b3 + ax\u00b2 + bx + c = (x - r)(x - s)(x - t)\n\nwhere r, s, and t are the three distinct roots. Expanding the right-hand side, we get:\n\nx\u00b3 + ax\u00b2 + bx + c = x\u00b3 - (r + s + t)x\u00b2 + (rs + st + tr)x - rst\n\nComparing coefficients, we have:\n\na = -(r + s + t)\nb = rs + st + tr\nc = -rst\n\nGiven that c = 6, we have:\n\n-rst = 6\n\nSince r, s, t are integers, and their product is 6, we need to find all possible combinations of three distinct integers whose product is 6.\n\nThe divisors of 6 are: \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b13, \u00b16. Since the roots are distinct, none of them can be zero. Also, since the product is 6, none of the roots can be 6, because 6 is the product of all three roots, and if one root is 6, the other two would have to be 1, but 1 is not a divisor of 6. Similarly, if one root is 2, the other two would have to be 3, but 3 is not a divisor of 6. Therefore, the roots must be among \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b13.\n\nLet's list all possible combinations of three distinct integers from \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b13 whose product is 6:\n\n1. (1, 2, 3)\n2.

(-3, -2, -1)\n\nHowever, we need to check which of these combinations satisfy the condition that the sum of the roots is equal to -a.\n\nFor example, for the combination (1, 2, 3), the sum is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, so a = -6. For (1, 2, -3), the sum is 1 + 2 - 3 = 0, so a = 0. For (1, -2, 3), the sum is 1 - 2 + 3 = 2, so a = -2. And so on.\n\nLet's compute the sum for each combination:\n\n1.

  "Step 1: The problem is asking us to find the value of the most expensive item in Coinland that cannot be purchased using the available coins with exact change. The available coins have values of 6, 10, and 15 cents. We need to determine the maximum value of an item that cannot be bought with these coins and then find the sum of its digits.\n\nStep 2: To solve this problem, we can use the concept of the Frobenius coin problem. The Frobenius number is the largest amount that cannot be obtained using the available coin denominations. In this case, the available coin denominations are 6, 10, and 15 cents. We need to find the Frobenius number for these denominations.\n\nStep 3: The Frobenius number can be calculated using the formula: F(a, b, c) = ab + ac + bc - a - b - c. However, this formula is valid only when the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the denominations is 1. In this case, the gcd of 6, 10, and 15 is 1, so the formula is applicable.\n\nStep 4: Let's calculate the Frobenius number using the formula. First, we need to compute the products and sums involved.\n\nStep 5: Compute ab: 6 * 10 = 60, 6 * 15 = 90, 10 * 15 = 150. Then, compute the sum of these products: 60 + 90 + 150 = 300. Next, compute the sum of the denominations: 6 + 10 + 15 = 31. Then, subtract the sum of the denominations from the sum of the products: 300 - 31 = 269.\n\nStep 6: Therefore, the Frobenius number is 269. This means that the most expensive item that cannot be purchased with exact change is worth 269 cents.\n\nStep 7: Finally, we need to find the sum of the digits of 269. The digits of 269 are 2, 6, and 9. Adding these digits together: 2 + 6 + 9 = 17.\n\nStep 8: Therefore, the sum of the digits of the most expensive item that cannot be purchased with exact change is 17.\n\nStep 9: So, the final answer is \\boxed{17}",

  "Step 1: First, let's understand the problem. Carlos wants to buy running shoes from a sports store. The shoes are on sale with a 20% discount. Additionally, there is a 7.5% sales tax on the discounted price. Carlos has $43 to spend. We need to find the original price of the most expensive shoes he can afford.\n\nStep 2: To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the amount Carlos has to determine the maximum original price of the shoes. Let's denote the original price of the shoes as P. After a 20% discount, the price becomes P - 0.20P = 0.80P. Then, a 7.5% sales tax is added to this discounted price, making the final price 0.80P + 0.075(0.80P).\n\nStep 3: The total amount Carlos has to spend is $43. Therefore, the final price after discount and tax must be equal to or less than $43. So, we can set up the inequality: 0.80P + 0.075(0.80P) \u2264 43.\n\nStep 4: First, let's simplify the left side of the inequality. Multiply 0.075 by 0.80P: 0.075(0.80P) = 0.06P. So, the inequality becomes 0.80P + 0.06P \u2264 43.\n\nStep 5: Combine like terms: 0.80P + 0.06P = 0.86P. Therefore, the inequality is 0.86P \u2264 43.\n\nStep 6: To find the maximum original price P, we need to solve the equation 0.86P = 43.\n\nStep 7: Divide both sides by 0.86 to isolate P: P = 43 / 0.86.\n\nStep 8: Calculate 43 / 0.86.\n\nStep 9: 43 / 0.86 = 50.\n\nStep 10: Therefore, the original price of the most expensive shoes Carlos can afford is $50.\n\nStep 11: So, the final answer is \\boxed{50}",
  "Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem states that when n standard six-sided dice are rolled, the product of the numbers rolled can be any of 936 possible values. We need to find the value of n.\n\nStep 2: Determine the possible values of the product\nEach die can roll a number from 1 to 6. The product of the numbers rolled can range from 1 (if all dice roll 1) to 6^n (if all dice roll 6). Therefore, the possible values of the product are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, ..., 6^n.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the number of possible values\nThe problem states that the product can be any of 936 possible values. Therefore, we need to find the value of n such that the number of possible values of the product is 936.\n\nStep 4: Use the formula for the number of divisors\nThe number of possible values of the product is equal to the number of divisors of 6^n. The number of divisors of a number can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of divisors = (a1 + 1)(a2 + 1)...(ak + 1)\n\nwhere a1, a2, ..., ak are the exponents of the prime factors of the number.\n\nStep 5: Factorize 6^n\n6^n = (2 * 3)^n = 2^n * 3^n\n\nTherefore, the number of divisors of 6^n is (n + 1)(n + 1) = (n + 1)^2.\n\nStep 6: Set up the equation\nWe know that the number of possible values is 936. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n(n + 1)^2 = 936\n\nStep 7: Solve the equation\nSolve the equation (n + 1)^2 = 936.\n\nStep 8: Take the square root\nTake the square root of both sides:\n\nn + 1 = sqrt(936)\n\nStep 9: Calculate the square root\nCalculate the square root of 936.\n\nsqrt(936) = sqrt(6^2 * 3^2) = 6 * 3 = 18\n\nTherefore, n + 1 = 18.\n\nStep 10: Solve for n\nSolve for n:\n\nn + 1 = 18\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\nn = 18 - 1\n\nn = 17\n\nTherefore, n = 17.\n\nStep 11: Verify the solution\nVerify that when n = 17, the number of possible values of the product is indeed 936.\n\nCompute the number of divisors of 6^17:\n\nNumber of divisors = (17 + 1)^2 = 18^2 = 324\n\nHowever, the problem states that the number of possible values is 936. Therefore, n = 17 is not the correct solution.\n\nStep 12: Re-evaluate the problem\nRe-evaluate the problem. The problem states that the product can be any of 936 possible values. Therefore, the number of possible values is 936. However, the number of divisors of 6^n is (n + 1)^2. Therefore, (n + 1)^2 = 936.\n\nStep 13: Solve the equation again\nSolve the equation (n + 1)^2 = 936 again.\n\nTake the square root:\n\nn + 1 = sqrt(936)\n\nCompute the square root:\n\nsqrt(936) = sqrt(6^2 * 3^2) = 6 * 3 = 18\n\nTherefore, n + 1 = 18.\n\nSolve for n:\n\nn + 1 = 18\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\nn = 18 - 1\n\nn = 17\n\nHowever, in step 11, we verified that when n = 17, the number of divisors is 324, not 936. Therefore, n = 17 is not the correct solution.\n\nStep 14: Check the next possible value\nCheck the next possible value of n.\n\nIf n = 17 is not correct, then n must be less than 17. Therefore, try n = 16.\n\nCompute the number of divisors of 6^16:\n\nNumber of divisors = (16 + 1)^2 = 17^2 = 289\n\nHowever, 289 is not equal to 936.

  "Step 1:  The problem involves finding the greatest common divisor (gcd) of four positive integers a, b, c, and d, given certain least common multiple (lcm) relations. To approach this, we need to understand the relationship between gcd and lcm.\nStep 2:  The key relationship is that for any two positive integers m and n, the product of their gcd and lcm is equal to the product of the two numbers themselves. That is, gcd(m, n) * lcm(m, n) = m * n. This can be expressed as gcd(m, n) = (m * n) / lcm(m, n).\nStep 3:  We are given the following relations:\nStep 4:  1. abcd = 2^6 * 3^9 * 5^7\nStep 5:  2. lcm(a, b) = 2^3 * 3^2 * 5^3\nStep 6:  3. lcm(a, c) = 2^3 * 3^3 * 5^3\nStep 7:  4. lcm(a, d) = 2^3 * 3^3 * 5^3\nStep 8:  5. lcm(b, c) = 2^1 * 3^3 * 5^2\nStep 9:  6. lcm(b, d) = 2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2\nStep 10:  7. lcm(c, d) = 2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2\nStep 11:  We need to find gcd(a, b, c, d).\n\nStep 12:  To find gcd(a, b, c, d), we can use the formula gcd(a, b, c, d) = gcd(a, gcd(b, gcd(c, d))). This is a generalization of the two-variable gcd formula.\n\nStep 13:  First, let's compute gcd(b, c). We can use the formula gcd(b, c) = (b * c) / lcm(b, c). From relation 5, lcm(b, c) = 2^1 * 3^3 * 5^2. So, gcd(b, c) = (b * c) / (2^1 * 3^3 * 5^2).\n\nStep 14:  Similarly, gcd(c, d) = (c * d) / lcm(c, d). From relation 7, lcm(c, d) = 2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2. So, gcd(c, d) = (c * d) / (2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2).\n\nStep 15:  Then, gcd(b, gcd(c, d)) = gcd(b, (c * d) / (2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2)). This can be computed as gcd(b, (c * d) / (2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2)) = (b * (c * d) / (2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2)) / lcm(b, (c * d) / (2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2)).\n\nStep 16:  We need to compute lcm(b, (c * d) / (2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2)). From relation 6, lcm(b, d) = 2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2. So, lcm(b, (c * d) / (2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2)) = lcm(b, (c * d) / (2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2)) = lcm(b, c * d) / (2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2).\n\nStep 17:  From relation 7, lcm(c, d) = 2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2. So, lcm(b, c * d) = lcm(b, c * d) = lcm(b, c) * lcm(b, d) / lcm(b, c). From relation 5, lcm(b, c) = 2^1 * 3^3 * 5^2. From relation 6, lcm(b, d) = 2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2. So, lcm(b, c) * lcm(b, d) / lcm(b, c) = lcm(b, d) = 2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2.\n\nStep 18:  Therefore, lcm(b, (c * d) / (2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2)) = lcm(b, c * d) / (2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2) = (2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2) / (2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2) = 1.\n\nStep 19:  So, gcd(b, gcd(c, d)) = (b * (c * d) / (2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2)) / 1 = b * (c * d) / (2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2).\n\nStep 20:  Similarly, gcd(a, b, c, d) = gcd(a, gcd(b, gcd(c, d))) = gcd(a, b * (c * d) / (2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2)).\n\nStep 21:  We need to compute gcd(a, b * (c * d) / (2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2)). This can be computed as gcd(a, b * (c * d) / (2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2)) = (a * b * (c * d) / (2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2)) / lcm(a, b * (c * d) / (2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2)).\n\nStep 22:  We need to compute lcm(a, b * (c * d) / (2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2)). From relation 2, lcm(a, b) = 2^3 * 3^2 * 5^3. So, lcm(a, b * (c * d) / (2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2)) = lcm(a, b * (c * d) / (2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2)) = lcm(a, b) * lcm(a, (c * d) / (2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2)) / lcm(a, b).\n\nStep 23:  From relation 3, lcm(a, c) = 2^3 * 3^3 * 5^3. From relation 4, lcm(a, d) = 2^3 * 3^3 * 5^3. So, lcm(a, (c * d) / (2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2)) = lcm(a, c * d) / (2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2). From relation 1, abcd = 2^6 * 3^9 * 5^7. So, lcm(a, c * d) = lcm(a, c) * lcm(a, d) / lcm(a, c). From relation 3, lcm(a, c) = 2^3 * 3^3 * 5^3. From relation 4, lcm(a, d) = 2^3 * 3^3 * 5^3. So, lcm(a, c) * lcm(a, d) / lcm(a, c) = lcm(a, d) = 2^3 * 3^3 * 5^3.\n\nStep 24:  Therefore, lcm(a, (c * d) / (2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2)) = lcm(a, c * d) / (2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2) = (2^3 * 3^3 * 5^3) / (2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2) = 2 * 5.\n\nStep 25:  So, lcm(a, b * (c * d) / (2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2)) = lcm(a, b) * lcm(a, (c * d) / (2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2)) / lcm(a, b) = lcm(a, (c * d) / (2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2)) = 2 * 5 = 10.\n\nStep 26:  Therefore, gcd(a, b * (c * d) / (2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2)) = (a * b * (c * d) / (2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2)) / 10.\n\nStep 27:  We need to compute a * b * (c * d) / (2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2). From relation 1, abcd = 2^6 * 3^9 * 5^7. So, a * b * (c * d) = abcd = 2^6 * 3^9 * 5^7. Therefore, a * b * (c * d) / (2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2) = (2^6 * 3^9 * 5^7) / (2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2) = 2^4 * 3^6 * 5^5.\n\nStep 28:  Therefore, gcd(a, b * (c * d) / (2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2)) = (2^4 * 3^6 * 5^5) / 10 = 2^3 * 3^6 * 5^4.\n\nStep 29:  Therefore, gcd(a, b, c, d) = gcd(a, b * (c * d) / (2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2)) = 2^3 * 3^6 * 5^4.\n\nStep 30:  Therefore, the final answer is 2^3 * 3^6 * 5^4 = 8 * 729 * 625 = 8 * 450375 = 3603000.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{3603000}",
  "Step 1:  The problem involves finding the ratio of the areas of two circles, each inscribed with a specific right triangle. The first circle, denoted as circle A, has a 3-4-5 right triangle inscribed in it, while the second circle, denoted as circle B, has a 5-12-13 right triangle inscribed in it. We need to find the ratio of the area of circle A to the area of circle B and then express it as a fraction in simplest form. Finally, we have to calculate the sum of the numerator and denominator of this fraction.\nStep 2:  To approach this problem, we can start by recalling the relationship between the radius of a circle and the sides of a right triangle inscribed within it. The radius of the circle is equal to the circumradius of the triangle, which can be calculated using the formula R = abc / (4 * area), where a, b, and c are the sides of the triangle, and area is the area of the triangle. Alternatively, for a right triangle with legs a and b and hypotenuse c, the circumradius is R = c / 2.\nStep 3:  Therefore, for the 3-4-5 right triangle in circle A, the circumradius is R_A = 5 / 2. Similarly, for the 5-12-13 right triangle in circle B, the circumradius is R_B = 13 / 2.\nStep 4:  The area of a circle is given by the formula A = \u03c0 * R^2. So, the area of circle A is A_A = \u03c0 * (5/2)^2, and the area of circle B is A_B = \u03c0 * (13/2)^2.\nStep 5:  To find the ratio of the areas, we can compute A_A / A_B = (\u03c0 * (5/2)^2) / (\u03c0 * (13/2)^2) = (5/2)^2 / (13/2)^2 = (5/13)^2.\nStep 6:  Therefore, the ratio of the areas is (5/13)^2, which simplifies to 25/169.\nStep 7:  Hence, the sum of the numerator and denominator is 25 + 169 = 194.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{194}$",
  "Step 1: First, let's understand the problem. Jackson has a paintbrush that makes a narrow strip with a width of 6.5 millimeters. He has enough paint to make a strip 25 meters long. We need to find out how many square centimeters of paper Jackson could cover with paint.\n\nStep 2: To find the area that Jackson can cover, we need to calculate the area of the strip. The area of a strip is given by the formula: area = length \u00d7 width. However, the length is given in meters, and the width is given in millimeters. So, we need to convert the length from meters to millimeters and then multiply it by the width in millimeters to get the area in square millimeters. Then, we can convert the area from square millimeters to square centimeters.\n\nStep 3: First, let's convert the length from meters to millimeters. Since 1 meter = 1000 millimeters, we can convert 25 meters to millimeters by multiplying 25 by 1000. So, 25 meters = 25 \u00d7 1000 = 25,000 millimeters.\n\nStep 4: Now, we have the length in millimeters (25,000 mm) and the width in millimeters (6.5 mm). We can calculate the area by multiplying the length and width: area = 25,000 mm \u00d7 6.5 mm = 162,500 square millimeters.\n\nStep 5: Finally, we need to convert the area from square millimeters to square centimeters. Since 1 square centimeter = 10,000 square millimeters, we can convert 162,500 square millimeters to square centimeters by dividing by 10,000. So, 162,500 / 10,000 = 16.25 square centimeters.\n\nStep 6: Therefore, Jackson can cover 16.25 square centimeters of paper with paint.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{16.25}",
  "Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem is about a game where a $2 \\times 1$ rectangle is placed on a $3 \\times 3$ grid of squares, but the exact position of the rectangle is unknown. The goal is to find at least one square that is covered by the rectangle using the minimum number of turns. Each turn involves guessing a square, and after each guess, the game tells whether that square is covered by the rectangle.\n\nStep 2: Determine the total number of squares in the grid\nThe grid is a $3 \\times 3$ square, which means there are $3 \\times 3 = 9$ squares in total.\n\nStep 3: Consider the possible positions of the rectangle\nThe rectangle is $2 \\times 1$, so it can be placed in two possible orientations: horizontally or vertically. If placed horizontally, it would cover two adjacent squares in a row. If placed vertically, it would cover two adjacent squares in a column. Since the rectangle is $2 \\times 1$, it can be placed in any of the 6 possible positions: horizontally in the first row, horizontally in the second row, horizontally in the third row, vertically in the first column, vertically in the second column, or vertically in the third column.\n\nStep 4: Determine the minimum number of turns needed\nTo find the minimum number of turns needed to ensure that at least one square is covered, we need to consider the worst-case scenario. The worst-case scenario would be if the rectangle is placed in a position where none of the first few guessed squares are covered. We need to find the minimum number of turns such that, regardless of the position of the rectangle, at least one of the guessed squares is covered.\n\nStep 5: Apply the principle of the \"pigeonhole principle\"\nThe pigeonhole principle states that if n items are put into m containers, with n > m, then at least one container must contain more than one item. In this case, the squares are the \"items\" and the turns are the \"containers\". If we guess more than the number of possible positions of the rectangle, then at least one square must be covered.\n\nStep 6: Calculate the minimum number of turns\nSince there are 6 possible positions for the rectangle, we need to guess more than 6 squares to ensure that at least one is covered. Therefore, the minimum number of turns is 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nStep 7: Verify the answer\nLet's verify that 7 turns are sufficient. Suppose the rectangle is placed in any of the 6 possible positions. If we guess 7 squares, then at least one of them must be covered by the rectangle. Therefore, 7 turns are sufficient to ensure that at least one square is covered.\n\nStep 8: Conclusion\nTherefore, the minimum number of turns needed to ensure that at least one square is covered by the rectangle is 7.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{7}",
  "To solve this problem, we need to understand the behavior of the polynomial P(x) when its roots are removed. The roots of P(x) are at x = 1, 2, 3, ..., 10, each with a multiplicity of 1, 2, 3, ..., 10 respectively. When these roots are removed, the number line is divided into 11 disjoint open intervals. We need to determine how many of these intervals have P(x) positive.\n\nFirst, let's recall that the sign of a polynomial in an interval can be determined by the number of sign changes in the coefficients of the polynomial when written in descending order of powers. However, since P(x) is a product of linear factors, we can analyze the sign of each factor in each interval.\n\nLet's denote the intervals as I1, I2, ..., I11, where I1 is the interval (0, 1), I2 is (1, 2), ..., I11 is (10, \u221e). We need to determine the sign of P(x) in each interval.\n\nSince P(x) is a product of linear factors, the sign of P(x) in each interval is determined by the signs of the factors (x - k)^m, where k is a root and m is the multiplicity. If m is even, the factor is positive in the interval; if m is odd, the factor is negative.\n\nFor example, in the interval I1 = (0, 1), the factor (x - 1)^1 is negative, (x - 2)^2 is positive, (x - 3)^3 is negative, and so on. So, the sign of P(x) in I1 is (-1) * (+1) * (-1) * ... = (-1)^1 * (+1)^2 * (-1)^3 * ... = (-1)^1 * (+1)^2 * (-1)^3 * ... = (-1)^1 * (+1)^2 * (-1)^3 * ... = (-1)^1 * (+1)^2 * (-1)^3 * ... = (-1)^1 *

  "Step 1: The problem asks us to find the number of integers n for which the given expression represents a real number. The expression involves logarithms and square roots, so we need to analyze the conditions under which the expression is defined and real.\n\nStep 2: First, let's break down the expression and identify any restrictions on n. The expression is \\[\\sqrt{\\frac{\\log (n^2) - (\\log n)^2}{\\log n - 3}}.\\] We need to ensure that the denominator is not zero and that the argument of the square root is non-negative.\n\nStep 3: Let's start by simplifying the expression. The numerator is \\log (n^2) - (\\log n)^2. Since \\log (n^2) = 2 \\log n, we can rewrite the numerator as 2 \\log n - (\\log n)^2. The denominator is \\log n - 3. So the expression becomes \\[\\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\log n - (\\log n)^2}{\\log n - 3}}.\\]\n\nStep 4: To ensure that the expression is real, the denominator must be non-zero, and the numerator must be non-negative. So we need to find the values of n for which the denominator is non-zero and the numerator is non-negative.\n\nStep 5: First, let's consider the denominator. The denominator is \\log n - 3. For the denominator to be non-zero, we must have \\log n \u2260 3. Since \\log n is defined for n > 0, we can rewrite this as \\log n \u2260 3, which is equivalent to n \u2260 10^3 = 1000. So the denominator is non-zero for all n \u2260 1000.\n\nStep 6: Next, let's consider the numerator. The numerator is 2 \\log n - (\\log n)^2. To ensure that the numerator is non-negative, we need to find the values of n for which 2 \\log n - (\\log n)^2 \u2265 0.\n\nStep 7: Let's define a function f(x) = 2x - x^2, where x = \\log n. Then we need to find the values of x for which f(x) \u2265 0.\n\nStep 8: To find the values of x for which f(x) \u2265 0, we can factor the quadratic expression: 2x - x^2 = x(2 - x). So f(x) = x(2 - x). Therefore, f(x) \u2265 0 when x \u2265 0 and x \u2264 2, or x \u2264 0 and x \u2265 2. Since x = \\log n, we have x \u2265 0 when n \u2265 1, and x \u2264 2 when n \u2264 10^2 = 100. Similarly, x \u2264 0 when n \u2264 1, and x \u2265 2 when n \u2265 10^2 = 100.\n\nStep 9: Therefore, the numerator is non-negative when n \u2265 1 and n \u2264 100, or n \u2264 1 and n \u2265 100. However, since n must be positive, the second case is impossible. So the numerator is non-negative when n \u2265 1 and n \u2264 100.\n\nStep 10: Therefore, the expression is real when n \u2260 1000 and n is between 1 and 100 (inclusive).\n\nStep 11: So the number of integers n for which the expression is real is the number of integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), excluding 1000.\n\nStep 12: The number of integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) is 100. However, we need to exclude 1000, which is not in the interval [1, 100]. Therefore, the number of integers n for which the expression is real is 100.\n\nStep 13: Therefore, the final answer is 100.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{100}",
  "Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe need to find the number of nonempty subsets B of the set {0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 12} such that the number of elements in B is equal to the least element of B.\n\nStep 2: Identify the possible least elements\nSince the least element of B must be equal to the number of elements in B, the least element can be 1, 2, 3, ..., 12. However, since the set is {0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 12}, the least element cannot be 0 because the number of elements in B must be positive. Therefore, the possible least elements are 1, 2, 3, ..., 12.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the number of subsets for each possible least element\nFor each possible least element k, the number of elements in B is k. Therefore, the remaining elements in B must be k - 1 elements chosen from the set {k + 1, k + 2, ..., 12}. This is a combination problem, where we need to choose k - 1 elements from 12 - k elements.\n\nStep 4: Compute the number of combinations for each k\nFor each k from 1 to 12, compute the number of combinations of k - 1 elements chosen from 12 - k elements. This is given by the formula C(12 - k, k - 1).\n\nStep 5: Sum the number of combinations for each k\nThe total number of subsets B satisfying the condition is the sum of the number of combinations for each k from 1 to 12.\n\nStep 6: Compute the sum\nLet's compute the sum:\n\nC(11, 0) + C(10, 1) + C(9, 2) + C(8, 3) + C(7, 4) + C(6, 5) + C(5, 6) + C(4, 7) + C(3, 8) + C(2, 9) + C(1, 10) + C(0, 11)\n\nUsing the formula C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!) for each term.\n\nStep 7: Calculate each term\n\nC(11, 0) = 11! / (0! * (11 - 0)!) = 1\n\nC(10, 1) = 10! / (1! * (10 - 1)!) = 10\n\nC(9, 2) = 9! / (2! * (9 - 2)!) = 36\n\nC(8, 3) = 8! / (3! * (8 - 3)!) = 56\n\nC(7, 4) = 7! / (4! * (7 - 4)!) = 35\n\nC(6, 5) = 6! / (5! * (6 - 5)!) = 6\n\nC(5, 6) = 0 (since 6 > 5)\n\nC(4, 7) = 0 (since 7 > 4)\n\nC(3, 8) = 0 (since 8 > 3)\n\nC(2, 9) = 0 (since 9 > 2)\n\nC(1, 10) = 0 (since 10 > 1)\n\nC(0, 11) = 0 (since 11 > 0)\n\nStep 8: Sum the terms\n\n1 + 10 + 36 + 56 + 35 + 6 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 144\n\nTherefore, the total number of subsets B satisfying the condition is 144.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{144}",
  "Step 1: The problem asks for the area of the region in the coordinate plane defined by the inequality \\(| | x | - 1 | + | | y | - 1 | \\le 1\\). To solve this, we need to understand the geometric shape described by this inequality.\n\nStep 2: The inequality involves absolute values, which typically correspond to the distance from a point to a line or a set of lines. In this case, the expression \\(| | x | - 1 | + | | y | - 1 | \\le 1\\) can be interpreted as the sum of the distances from the point \\((x, y)\\) to the lines \\(x = 1\\) and \\(y = 1\\) being less than or equal to 1.\n\nStep 3: Let's break down the inequality into four cases based on the signs of \\(x - 1\\) and \\(y - 1\\). This will help us visualize the region.\n\nCase 1: When \\(x \\ge 1\\) and \\(y \\ge 1\\), the inequality becomes \\(|x - 1| + |y - 1| \\le 1\\). This is the same as \\(x - 1 + y - 1 \\le 1\\), which simplifies to \\(x + y \\le 3\\). This is a triangle with vertices at \\((1, 1)\\), \\((3, 1)\\), and \\((1, 3)\\).\n\nCase 2: When \\(x \\ge 1\\) and \\(y < 1\\), the inequality becomes \\(|x - 1| + |y + 1| \\le 1\\). This is the same as \\(x - 1 + 1 - y \\le 1\\), which simplifies to \\(x - y \\le 1\\). This is a triangle with vertices at \\((1, 0)\\), \\((2, 1)\\), and \\((1, 1)\\).\n\nCase 3: When \\(x < 1\\) and \\(y \\ge 1\\), the inequality becomes \\(|1 - x| + |y - 1| \\le 1\\). This is the same as \\(1 - x + y - 1 \\le 1\\), which simplifies to \\(y - x \\le 1\\). This is a triangle with vertices at \\((0, 1)\\), \\((1, 1)\\), and \\((1, 2)\\).\n\nCase 4: When \\(x < 1\\) and \\(y < 1\\), the inequality becomes \\(|1 - x| + |1 - y| \\le 1\\). This is the same as \\(1 - x + 1 - y \\le 1\\), which simplifies to \\(2 - x - y \\le 1\\), or \\(x + y \\ge 1\\). This is a triangle with vertices at \\((0, 0)\\), \\((1, 0)\\), and \\((0, 1)\\).\n\nStep 4: The region defined by the inequality is the union of these four triangles. However, since the original inequality is symmetric with respect to both the x-axis and the y-axis, the region is also symmetric. Therefore, the region is a square with side length 2 centered at (1, 1).\n\nStep 5: The area of a square is given by the formula \\(A = s^2\\), where \\(s\\) is the length of a side. In this case, the side length is 2, so the area is \\(A = 2^2 = 4\\).\n\nTherefore, the area of the region is 4.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{4}"
