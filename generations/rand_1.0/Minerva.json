  "Problem: Each of the two Magellan telescopes has a diameter of $6.5 \\mathrm{~m}$. In one configuration the effective focal length is $72 \\mathrm{~m}$. Find the diameter of the image of a planet (in $\\mathrm{cm}$ ) at this focus if the angular diameter of the planet at the time of the observation is $45^{\\prime \\prime}$. Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of angular diameter and the relationship between the angular diameter, the focal length, and the diameter of the image.\nStep 2:  First, we need to convert the angular diameter of the planet from arcseconds to radians. We know that $1^{\\prime \\prime} = \\frac{1}{3600} \\mathrm{rad}$, so $45^{\\prime \\prime} = 45 \\times \\frac{1}{3600} \\mathrm{rad} = 0.0125 \\mathrm{rad}$.\nStep 3:  The angular diameter of the planet is related to the diameter of the image by the equation $\\theta=\\frac{d}{f}$, where $\\theta$ is the angular diameter, $d$ is the diameter of the image, and $f$ is the focal length.\nStep 4:  We are given that the effective focal length is $72 \\mathrm{~m}$, so we can use this value for $f$ in our equation.\nStep 5:  Rearranging the equation to solve for $d$, we get $d=\\theta f$. Plugging in the values, we have $d=(0.0125 \\mathrm{rad})(72 \\mathrm{~m})=0.9 \\mathrm{~m}$.\nStep 6:  However, we need to find the diameter of the image in centimeters, so we need to convert the diameter from meters to centimeters. Since $1 \\mathrm{~m} = 100 \\mathrm{~cm}$, we have $0.9 \\mathrm{~m} = 0.9 \\times 100 \\mathrm{~cm} = 90 \\mathrm{~cm}$.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the diameter of the image of the planet at this focus is $90 \\mathrm{~cm}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{90}$",

  "Step 1:  To find the critical angle for the light to be internally reflected at $H$, we need to consider the refraction of light as it passes from the glass into the air.\nStep 2:  The critical angle is the angle of incidence above which total internal reflection occurs. This happens when the angle of refraction is $90^{\\circ}$.\nStep 3:  We can use Snell's law to relate the angles of incidence and refraction to the indices of refraction of the two media involved.\nStep 4:  Snell's law states that $n_1 \\sin \\theta_1 = n_2 \\sin \\theta_2$, where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the indices of refraction of the two media, and $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$ are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.\nStep 5:  In this case, the light is passing from the glass into the air, so we have $n_1 = 1.5$ for the glass and $n_2 = 1$ for the air.\nStep 6:  We want to find the critical angle, which is the angle of incidence in the glass that results in an angle of refraction of $90^{\\circ}$ in the air.\nStep 7:  Using Snell's law, we can write $\\sin \\theta_c = \\frac{n_2}{n_1} \\sin 90^{\\circ}$, where $\\theta_c$ is the critical angle.\nStep 8:  Substituting the values, we get $\\sin \\theta_c = \\frac{1}{1.5} \\sin 90^{\\circ} = \\frac{1}{1.5} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{2}{3}$.\nStep 9:  To find the critical angle, we take the inverse sine of $\\frac{2}{3}$, which gives us $\\theta_c = \\sin^{-1} \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)$.\nStep 10:  Evaluating this, we get $\\theta_c \\approx 41.81^{\\circ}$.\nStep 11:  Therefore, the critical angle for the light to be internally reflected at $H$ is approximately $41.81^{\\circ}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{41.8}$",
  "Problem: A particular star has an absolute magnitude $M=-7$. If this star is observed in a galaxy that is at a distance of $3 \\mathrm{Mpc}$, what will its apparent magnitude be?\nStep 1:  To solve this problem, we need to use the relationship between absolute magnitude, apparent magnitude, and distance.\nStep 2:  The formula that connects these three quantities is: $m = M + 5 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{d}{10} \\right)$, where $m$ is the apparent magnitude, $M$ is the absolute magnitude, and $d$ is the distance in parsecs.\nStep 3:  Given that the absolute magnitude $M = -7$ and the distance $d = 3 \\mathrm{Mpc}$, we can substitute these values into the formula.\nStep 4:  First, we need to convert the distance from megaparsecs to parsecs. Since $1 \\mathrm{Mpc} = 10^6 \\mathrm{pc}$, the distance in parsecs is $3 \\times 10^6 \\mathrm{pc}$.\nStep 5:  Now, we can substitute the values into the formula: $m = -7 + 5 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{3 \\times 10^6}{10} \\right)$.\nStep 6:  Simplifying the expression inside the logarithm, we get: $m = -7 + 5 \\log_{10} (3 \\times 10^5)$.\nStep 7:  Using the property of logarithms that $\\log_{10} (ab) = \\log_{10} a + \\log_{10} b$, we can rewrite the expression as: $m = -7 + 5 (\\log_{10} 3 + \\log_{10} 10^5)$.\nStep 8:  Since $\\log_{10} 10^5 = 5$, the expression simplifies to: $m = -7 + 5 (\\log_{10} 3 + 5)$.\nStep 9:  Further simplifying, we get: $m = -7 + 5 \\log_{10} 3 + 25$.\nStep 10:  Combining the constants, we have: $m = 18 + 5 \\log_{10} 3$.\nStep 11:  Now, we need to calculate the value of $5 \\log_{10} 3$.\nStep 12:  Using a calculator, we find that $\\log_{10} 3 \\approx 0.477$.\nStep 13:  Multiplying this value by 5, we get: $5 \\log_{10} 3 \\approx 2.385$.\nStep 14:  Finally, adding this value to 18, we get the apparent magnitude: $m \\approx 20.385$.\nStep 15:  Therefore, the apparent magnitude of the star is approximately $20.385$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{20.385}$",
  "Step 1:  To find the gravitational acceleration due to the Sun at the location of the Earth's orbit, we can use the formula for gravitational acceleration, which is given by $g = \\frac{G M}{r^2}$, where $G$ is the gravitational constant, $M$ is the mass of the Sun, and $r$ is the distance from the Sun to the point where we want to find the acceleration.\nStep 2:  First, we need to identify the values of the gravitational constant $G$, the mass of the Sun $M$, and the distance $r$.\nStep 3:  The gravitational constant $G$ is approximately $6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\mathrm{N} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^2 / \\mathrm{kg}^2$.\nStep 4:  The mass of the Sun $M$ is approximately $1.989 \\times 10^{30} \\, \\mathrm{kg}$.\nStep 5:  The distance $r$ is given as $1 \\mathrm{AU}$, which is equal to $1.496 \\times 10^{11} \\, \\mathrm{m}$.\nStep 6:  Now, we can substitute these values into the formula for gravitational acceleration to find the acceleration due to the Sun at the location of the Earth's orbit.\nStep 7:  Plugging in the values, we get $g = \\frac{(6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\mathrm{N} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^2 / \\mathrm{kg}^2)(1.989 \\times 10^{30} \\, \\mathrm{kg})}{(1.496 \\times 10^{11} \\, \\mathrm{m})^2}$.\nStep 8:  Simplifying this expression, we find that $g = \\frac{1.327 \\times 10^{20}}{2.236 \\times 10^{22}}$.\nStep 9:  Evaluating this expression, we get $g = 5.9 \\, \\mathrm{m} / \\mathrm{s}^2$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the gravitational acceleration due to the Sun at the location of the Earth's orbit is $5.9 \\, \\mathrm{m} / \\mathrm{s}^2$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{5.9}$",
  "## Step 1: Recall Snell's law\nSnell's law states that the ratio of the sines of the angles of incidence and refraction is equal to the ratio of the velocities of the two media, or equivalently, the inverse ratio of the indices of refraction. Mathematically, this can be expressed as $n_1 \\sin{\\theta_1} = n_2 \\sin{\\theta_2}$, where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the indices of refraction of the first and second media, respectively, and $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$ are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.\n\n## Step 2: Apply Snell's law to the given problem\nIn this problem, the light is incident on the surface of the water at an angle $\\theta_w$ with respect to the surface normal. The index of refraction of water is given as $n=1.3$. We want to find the angle of the light once it emerges from the water into the air, $\\theta_a$. Using Snell's law, we have $1.3 \\sin{\\theta_w} = \\sin{\\theta_a}$.\n\n## Step 3: Solve for $\\theta_a$\nTo find the expression for $\\theta_a$ in terms of $\\theta_w$, we can rearrange the equation from Step 2 to isolate $\\sin{\\theta_a}$. This gives us $\\sin{\\theta_a} = 1.3 \\sin{\\theta_w}$. To find $\\theta_a$, we take the inverse sine of both sides, which gives us $\\theta_a = \\arcsin{1.3 \\sin{\\theta_w}}$.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the critical angle\nThe critical angle is the value of $\\theta_w$ such that the light will not emerge from the water. This occurs when $\\sin{\\theta_a} = 1$, since the sine of the angle of refraction is equal to 1 when the angle of refraction is 90 degrees. Using Snell's law, we have $1.3 \\sin{\\theta_w} = 1$. To find the critical angle, we can rearrange this equation to isolate $\\sin{\\theta_w}$, which gives us $\\sin{\\theta_w} = \\frac{1}{1.3}$. To find the critical angle, we take the inverse sine of both sides, which gives us $\\theta_w = \\arcsin{\\frac{1}{1.3}}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\arcsin{\\frac{1}{1.3}}}$",
  "Step 1:  To find the theoretical limiting angular resolution of the telescope, we can use the Rayleigh criterion, which states that the minimum angle $\\theta$ between two point sources that can be resolved is given by $\\theta=1.22 \\frac{\\lambda}{D}$, where $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of light and $D$ is the diameter of the telescope.\nStep 2:  Given that the diameter of the telescope is $8$ inches, we need to convert this to meters to ensure consistency with the units of the wavelength. Since $1 \\mathrm{~inch}=2.54 \\mathrm{~cm}$, the diameter in meters is $8 \\times 2.54 \\times 10^{-2} \\mathrm{~m}=0.2032 \\mathrm{~m}$.\nStep 3:  The wavelength of light in the visible spectrum is given as $\\lambda=5000 \\AA=500 \\mathrm{~nm}=5 \\times 10^{-5} \\mathrm{~cm}=5 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~m}$.\nStep 4:  Now, we can substitute these values into the Rayleigh criterion formula to find the limiting angular resolution.\nStep 5:  Plugging in the values, we get $\\theta=1.22 \\frac{5 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~m}}{0.2032 \\mathrm{~m}}$.\nStep 6:  Simplifying this expression, we find $\\theta=3.01 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~rad}$.\nStep 7:  To convert this to arcseconds, we use the conversion factor $1 \\mathrm{~rad} \\approx 206265 \\mathrm{~arcsec}$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the limiting angular resolution in arcseconds is $\\theta \\approx 3.01 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~rad} \\times 206265 \\mathrm{~arcsec / rad} \\approx 0.0062 \\mathrm{~arcsec}$.\nStep 9:  Rounding to two significant figures, the limiting angular resolution is approximately $0.0062 \\mathrm{~arcsec}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0.0062}$",

  "We are given that the surface area of the planet is $2 \\%$ of that of its parent star. The magnitude of an object is related to its flux, which is the amount of light per unit area. Therefore, the ratio of the flux of the planet to the flux of the parent star is the same as the ratio of the surface area of the planet to the surface area of the parent star. The flux of the planet is negligible, so the flux of the system during transit is the flux of the parent star minus the flux of the planet. Therefore, the flux of the system during transit is $0.98$ times the flux of the parent star. The magnitude of an object is related to its flux by the equation $m = -2.5 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{F}{F_0} \\right)$, where $F$ is the flux of the object and $F_0$ is the flux of a standard object. Therefore, the magnitude of the system during transit is $-2.5 \\log_{10} \\left( 0.98 \\right)$, which is $-2.5 \\left( -0.0100 \\right)$, which is $0.0250$. The magnitude of the parent star is $0$, so the decrease in magnitude of the system during transit is $0 - 0.0250$, which is $-0.0250$. Therefore, the decrease in magnitude of the system during transit is $\\boxed{-0.0250}$",
  "Step 1:  To solve this problem, we first need to understand the relationship between the energy levels in an atom and the atomic number $Z$.\nStep 2:  The Bohr energy levels scale as $Z^{2}$, which means that the energy of the $n$th level is proportional to $Z^{2}$. This relationship allows us to estimate the energy of the photon emitted when an electron transitions from one energy level to another.\nStep 3:  We are given that the transition is from $n=3$ to $n=2$ in an iron atom, which has an atomic number of $Z=26$. We are also told to assume that the iron atom is completely stripped of all its electrons except for one.\nStep 4:  The energy of the photon emitted during this transition can be calculated using the formula $\\Delta E = E_3 - E_2$, where $E_n$ is the energy of the $n$th level.\nStep 5:  Since the energy levels scale as $Z^{2}$, we can express the energy of the $n$th level as $E_n = \\frac{13.6 \\text{ eV}}{n^2} \\cdot Z^2$.\nStep 6:  Substituting $n=3$ and $n=2$ into the formula, we get $E_3 = \\frac{13.6 \\text{ eV}}{3^2} \\cdot 26^2$ and $E_2 = \\frac{13.6 \\text{ eV}}{2^2} \\cdot 26^2$.\nStep 7:  Therefore, the energy of the photon emitted during the transition is $\\Delta E = E_3 - E_2 = \\frac{13.6 \\text{ eV}}{3^2} \\cdot 26^2 - \\frac{13.6 \\text{ eV}}{2^2} \\cdot 26^2$.\nStep 8:  Simplifying this expression, we get $\\Delta E = 13.6 \\text{ eV} \\cdot \\frac{26^2}{3^2} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{4}\\right) = 13.6 \\text{ eV} \\cdot \\frac{26^2}{3^2} \\cdot \\frac{3}{4}$.\nStep 9:  Evaluating this expression, we find that $\\Delta E = 13.6 \\text{ eV} \\cdot \\frac{676}{9} \\cdot \\frac{3}{4} = 13.6 \\text{ eV} \\cdot \\frac{17 \\cdot 4}{3} = 13.6 \\text{ eV} \\cdot \\frac{68}{3}$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the energy of the photon emitted during the transition is $\\Delta E = 13.6 \\text{ eV} \\cdot \\frac{68}{3} = 304.8 \\text{ eV}$.\nStep 11:  Now, we can use the formula $\\lambda = \\frac{hc}{\\Delta E}$ to find the wavelength of the photon, where $h$ is Planck's constant, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\\Delta E$ is the energy of the photon.\nStep 12:  Substituting the values of $h$, $c$, and $\\Delta E$, we get $\\lambda = \\frac{6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J s} \\cdot 3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}}{304.8 \\text{ eV} \\cdot 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J/eV}}$.\nStep 13:  Evaluating this expression, we find that $\\lambda = \\frac{6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J s} \\cdot 3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}}{304.8 \\text{ eV} \\cdot 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J/eV}} = \\frac{19.878 \\times 10^{-26} \\text{ J m}}{4.896 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ J}}$.\nStep 14:  Therefore, the wavelength of the photon is $\\lambda = \\frac{19.878 \\times 10^{-26} \\text{ J m}}{4.896 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ J}} = 4.07 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m}$.\nStep 15:  Converting this to Angstroms, we get $\\lambda = 4.07 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m} \\cdot \\frac{1 \\text{ \\AA}}{10^{-10} \\text{ m}} = 4.07 \\text{ \\AA}$.\nStep 16:  Therefore, the wavelength of the photon is $\\boxed{4.1}$ \\text{ \\AA}.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4.1}$",

We are interested in finding the transfer function $V_{o}(s) / V_{i}(s)$, where $V_{o}(s)$ is the Laplace transform of the voltage across the capacitor and $V_{i}(s)$ is the Laplace transform of the input voltage.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the relationships between the components in the s-domain\nIn the s-domain, the voltage across the resistor is $V_{R}(s) = I(s)R$, the voltage across the inductor is $V_{L}(s) = I(s)Ls$, and the voltage across the capacitor is $V_{C}(s) = \\frac{I(s)}{Cs}$.\n\n## Step 3: Apply Kirchhoff's voltage law to the circuit\nBy Kirchhoff's voltage law, the sum of the voltages across the components must be equal to the input voltage $V_{i}(s)$. Therefore, we have $V_{i}(s) = V_{R}(s) + V_{L}(s) + V_{C}(s)$.\n\n## Step 4: Substitute the expressions for the voltages across the components\nSubstituting the expressions for $V_{R}(s)$, $V_{L}(s)$, and $V_{C}(s)$, we get $V_{i}(s) = I(s)R + I(s)Ls + \\frac{I(s)}{Cs}$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve for the current I(s)\nWe can solve for the current $I(s)$ by rearranging the equation: $I(s) = \\frac{V_{i}(s)}{R + Ls + \\frac{1}{Cs}}$.\n\n## Step 6: Find the voltage across the capacitor V_C(s)\nThe voltage across the capacitor is given by $V_{C}(s) = \\frac{I(s)}{Cs}$. Substituting the expression for $I(s)$, we get $V_{C}(s) = \\frac{V_{i}(s)}{Cs + \\frac{1}{C} + Ls}$.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the expression for V_C(s)\nSimplifying the expression for $V_{C}(s)$, we get $V_{C}(s) = \\frac{V_{i}(s)}{\\frac{Ls + 1}{C} + Rs}$.\n\n## Step 8: Find the transfer function V_o(s) / V_i(s)\nThe transfer function is given by $\\frac{V_{o}(s)}{V_{i}(s)} = \\frac{V_{C}(s)}{V_{i}(s)}$. Substituting the expression for $V_{C}(s)$, we get $\\frac{V_{o}(s)}{V_{i}(s)} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{Ls + 1}{C} + Rs}$.\n\n## Step 9: Simplify the expression for the transfer function\nSimplifying the expression for the transfer function, we get $\\frac{V_{o}(s)}{V_{i}(s)} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{Ls + 1}{C} + Rs} = \\frac{C}{Ls + 1 + RCs}$.\n\n## Step 10: Write the final expression for the transfer function\nThe final expression for the transfer function is $\\frac{V_{o}(s)}{V_{i}(s)} = \\frac{C}{Ls + 1 + RCs}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{\\frac{C}{Ls + 1 + RCs}}$",

It is the wavelength of the characteristic X-ray emitted when an electron transitions from the L shell to the K shell in the atom.\nStep 2:  The energy of the X-ray emitted can be calculated using the formula $E = 13.6 \\, \\text{eV} \\times Z^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{1^2} - \\frac{1}{n^2} \\right)$, where $Z$ is the atomic number of the element and $n$ is the principal quantum number of the shell from which the electron is transitioning.\nStep 3:  For molybdenum, the atomic number $Z = 42$. The electron is transitioning from the L shell to the K shell, so $n = 2$.\nStep 4:  Substituting these values into the formula, we get $E = 13.6 \\, \\text{eV} \\times 42^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{1^2} - \\frac{1}{2^2} \\right)$.\nStep 5:  Simplifying this expression, we find $E = 13.6 \\, \\text{eV} \\times 1764 \\left( \\frac{1}{1} - \\frac{1}{4} \\right) = 13.6 \\, \\text{eV} \\times 1764 \\left( \\frac{3}{4} \\right)$.\nStep 6:  Continuing the calculation, we get $E = 13.6 \\, \\text{eV} \\times 1323 = 17973.8 \\, \\text{eV}$.\nStep 7:  To convert this energy from electronvolts (eV) to joules (J), we use the conversion factor $1 \\, \\text{eV} = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J}$.\nStep 8:  Therefore, the energy in joules is $E = 17973.8 \\, \\text{eV} \\times 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J/eV} = 2.883 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{J}$.\nStep 9:  Now, we can use the formula $\\lambda = \\frac{hc}{E}$ to find the wavelength, where $h$ is Planck's constant, $c$ is the speed of light, and $E$ is the energy of the photon.\nStep 10:  Substituting the values, we get $\\lambda = \\frac{6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J s} \\times 3.00 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{m/s}}{2.883 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{J}}$.\nStep 11:  Simplifying this expression, we find $\\lambda = \\frac{19.878 \\times 10^{-26} \\, \\text{J m}}{2.883 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{J}} = 6.89 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{m}$.\nStep 12:  Therefore, the wavelength of $\\lambda_{K_{\\alpha}}$ for molybdenum (Mo) is $6.89 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{m}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6.89 \\times 10^{-11}}",

  "The working temperature for silica glass is typically around 1000\u00b0C.

However, it's worth noting that the exact working temperature can vary depending on the specific application and the type of silica glass being used. In general, silica glass is used in high-temperature applications such as furnace windows, heat exchangers, and refractory components. \n\n\\boxed{1000}",

Please format your answer as $n \\times 10^x$ where $n$ is to 2 decimal places.\nStep 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the charge carrier density and the concentration of boron in germanium.\nStep 2:  The charge carrier density is given as $3.091 \\times 10^{17} / \\mathrm{cm}^{3}$, and we are asked to find the amount of boron (in grams) that will establish this density when incorporated into $1 \\mathrm{~kg}$ of germanium.\nStep 3:  We know that the charge carrier density is directly proportional to the concentration of boron in germanium.

10^{17} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}=1.80 \\times 10^{19} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$.\nStep 7:  Now that we have the concentration of boron, we can calculate the amount of boron required to achieve this concentration in $1 \\mathrm{~kg}$ of germanium.\nStep 8:  The molar mass of boron is $10.81 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$, and the molar mass of germanium is $72.59 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\nStep 9:  We can use the formula: $\\frac{m_{B}}{m_{\\mathrm{Ge}}}=\\frac{n_{B}}{N_{C}}$ to calculate the mass of boron required, where $m_{B}$ is the mass of boron, $m_{\\mathrm{Ge}}$ is the mass of germanium, $n_{B}$ is the concentration of boron, and $N_{C}$ is the number of atoms in the crystal.\nStep 10:  Substituting the values, we get: $\\frac{m_{B}}{1 \\mathrm{~kg}}=\\frac{1.80 \\times 10^{19} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}}{4.418 \\times 10^{22} \\mathrm{~cm}^{-3}} \\cdot \\frac{10.81 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}}{72.59 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mol}}$.\nStep 11:  Solving for $m_{B}$, we get: $m_{B}=0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are given an energy level of $-1.362 \\times 10^{-19} {~J}$ in atomic hydrogen and asked to determine if it is an allowed electron energy state. If it is, we need to find the principal quantum number $(n)$. If not, we need to find ${n}$ for the nearest allowed state.\n\n## Step 2: Recall the formula for electron energy levels\nThe energy of an electron in a hydrogen atom is given by the formula $E_{e l} =-\\frac{1}{n^{2}} {~K}$, where $n$ is the principal quantum number.\n\n## Step 3: Convert the given energy from Joules to Kelvin\nWe need to convert the given energy from Joules to Kelvin. We know that $1 {~J} = 1 {~kg} \\cdot {m}^{2} \\cdot {s}^{-2}$ and $1 {~K} = 1 {~J} \\cdot {K}^{-1}$. Therefore, we can convert the energy as follows:\n$-1.362 \\times 10^{-19} {~J}=-1.362 \\times 10^{-19} {~K}$\n\n## Step 4: Use the formula to find the principal quantum number (n)\nWe can now use the formula $E_{e l} =-\\frac{1}{n^{2}} {~K}$ to find the principal quantum number $(n)$.

  "Problem: Determine the highest linear density of atoms (atoms/m) encountered in vanadium (V). Please format your answer as $n \\times 10^x$ where $n$ is to 2 decimal places.\n## Step 1: Identify the atomic structure of vanadium\nVanadium has an atomic number of 23 and its atomic mass is approximately 50.94 g/mol. The atomic structure of vanadium is [Ar] 3d3 4s2.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the crystal structure of vanadium\nVanadium has a body-centered cubic (BCC) crystal structure. In a BCC structure, there is one atom at the center of the cube and one atom at each of the eight corners of the cube.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the lattice parameter of vanadium\nThe lattice parameter of vanadium is approximately 3.03 \u00c5.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of atoms per unit cell\nIn a BCC structure, there is one atom at the center of the cube and one atom at each of the eight corners of the cube. However, each corner atom is shared by eight adjacent unit cells, so the total number of atoms per unit cell is 1 (center atom) + 8/8 (corner atoms) = 2.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the volume of the unit cell\nThe volume of the unit cell is given by V = a^3, where a is the lattice parameter. V = (3.03 \u00c5)^3 = 27.52 \u00c5^3.\n\n## Step 6: Convert the volume of the unit cell to cubic meters\n1 \u00c5 = 10^-10 m, so 1 \u00c5^3 = (10^-10 m)^3 = 10^-30 m^3. Therefore, V = 27.52 \u00c5^3 * (10^-30 m^3 / 1 \u00c5^3) = 2.752 * 10^-29 m^3.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the mass of the unit cell\nThe mass of the unit cell is given by m = N * A, where N is the number of atoms per unit cell and A is the atomic mass. m = 2 * 50.94 g/mol = 101.88 g/mol.\n\n## Step 8: Convert the mass of the unit cell to kilograms\n1 g = 10^-3 kg, so 101.88 g = 101.88 * 10^-3 kg = 0.10188 kg.\n\n## Step 9: Calculate the linear density of atoms\nThe linear density of atoms is given by \u03c1 = m / V, where m is the mass of the unit cell and V is the volume of the unit cell. \u03c1 = 0.10188 kg / 2.752 * 10^-29 m^3 = 3.70 * 10^28 kg/m^3.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate the number of atoms per unit length\nThe number of atoms per unit length is given by n = \u03c1 / M, where \u03c1 is the linear density of atoms and M is the atomic mass. n = 3.70 * 10^28 kg/m^3 / 50.94 g/mol = 7.27 * 10^27 atoms/m^3.\n\n## Step 11: Calculate the linear density of atoms in atoms/m\nThe linear density of atoms in atoms/m is given by n = 7.27 * 10^27 atoms/m^3.\n\n## Step 12: Format the answer as n * 10^x\nThe linear density of atoms in atoms/m is 7.27 * 10^27.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{7.27 \\times 10^{27}}",
  "Step 1:  To solve for the solubility of $\\mathrm{SrF}_{2}$ in water, we first need to understand the concept of the solubility product constant ($\\mathrm{K}_{\\mathrm{sp}}$) and how it relates to the solubility of a compound in a solution.\nStep 2:  The $\\mathrm{K}_{\\mathrm{sp}}$ value for $\\mathrm{SrF}_{2}$ is given as $2.45 \\times 10^{-9}$ at room temperature. This value represents the equilibrium constant for the dissolution of $\\mathrm{SrF}_{2}$ in water.\nStep 3:  The dissolution reaction for $\\mathrm{SrF}_{2}$ in water can be represented as: $\\mathrm{SrF}_{2}(s) \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{Sr}^{2+}(aq) + 2\\mathrm{F}^{-}(aq)$\nStep 4:  The $\\mathrm{K}_{\\mathrm{sp}}$ expression for this reaction is given by: $\\mathrm{K}_{\\mathrm{sp}} = [\\mathrm{Sr}^{2+}][\\mathrm{F}^{-}]^{2}$\nStep 5:  We are asked to find the solubility of $\\mathrm{SrF}_{2}$ in water, which is represented by the concentration of $\\mathrm{Sr}^{2+}$ ions in the solution.\nStep 6:  Let's denote the solubility of $\\mathrm{SrF}_{2}$ as $S$. Since one mole of $\\mathrm{SrF}_{2}$ produces one mole of $\\mathrm{Sr}^{2+}$ ions and two moles of $\\mathrm{F}^{-}$ ions, the concentration of $\\mathrm{Sr}^{2+}$ ions will be equal to the solubility $S$, and the concentration of $\\mathrm{F}^{-}$ ions will be twice the solubility, or $2S$.\nStep 7:  Substituting these concentrations into the $\\mathrm{K}_{\\mathrm{sp}}$ expression gives us: $2.45 \\times 10^{-9} = S(2S)^{2}$\nStep 8:  Simplifying this equation, we get: $2.45 \\times 10^{-9} = 4S^{3}$\nStep 9:  To solve for $S$, we need to isolate $S$ on one side of the equation. Dividing both sides by $4$ gives us: $S^{3} = \\frac{2.45 \\times 10^{-9}}{4}$\nStep 10:  Taking the cube root of both sides, we find: $S = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{2.45 \\times 10^{-9}}{4}}$\nStep 11:  Evaluating this expression, we get: $S = \\sqrt[3]{6.125 \\times 10^{-10}}$\nStep 12:  Therefore, the solubility of $\\mathrm{SrF}_{2}$ in water is: $S = 1.58 \\times 10^{-3}$\nStep 13:  Hence, the final answer is: $\\boxed{1.58 \\times 10^{-3}}",

So, $t=90$ minutes $=90 \\times 60=5400$ seconds.\nStep 6:  Now, we can use the equation for diffusion to find the effective concentration of boron.\nStep 7:  We have $C(x, t)=C_{s}\\left[1-\\operatorname{erf}\\left(\\frac{x}{2 \\sqrt{Dt}}\\right)\\right]$, where $C_{s}=5 \\times 10^{16}$, $x=25 \\times 10^{-4}$ cm, $D=7.23 \\times 10^{-9}$ cm$^{2} / \\mathrm{s}$, and $t=5400$ seconds.\nStep 8:  Substituting these values into the equation, we get $C(25 \\times 10^{-4}, 5400)=5 \\times 10^{16}\\left[1-\\operatorname{erf}\\left(\\frac{25 \\times 10^{-4}}{2 \\sqrt{7.23 \\times 10^{-9} \\times 5400}}\\right)\\right]$.\nStep 9:  Evaluating the expression inside the error function, we get $\\frac{25 \\times 10^{-4}}{2 \\sqrt{7.23 \\times 10^{-9} \\times 5400}} \\approx 0.001$.\nStep 10:  Using a calculator to find the value of the error function, we get $\\operatorname{erf}(0.001) \\approx 0.001$.\nStep 11:  Substituting this value back into the equation, we get $C(25 \\times 10^{-4}, 5400) \\approx 5 \\times 10^{16}\\left[1-0.001\\right]$.\nStep 12:  Simplifying, we get $C(25 \\times 10^{-4}, 5400) \\approx 5 \\times 10^{16} \\times 0.999$.\nStep 13:  Evaluating the expression, we get $C(25 \\times 10^{-4}, 5400) \\approx 4.995 \\times 10^{16}$.\nStep 14:  Therefore, the effective concentration of boron is approximately $4.995 \\times 10^{16}$ atoms/ $\\mathrm{cm}^{3}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4.9950 \\times 10^{16}}",

The mass of an electron is approximately $9.11 \\times 10^{-31} \\mathrm{~kg}$.\nStep 5:  Now, we can substitute the given velocity and the mass of the electron into the formula to calculate the energy of the incident electron beam.\nStep 6:  Plugging in the values, we get $E = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 9.11 \\times 10^{-31} \\mathrm{~kg} \\times (4.4 \\times 10^{5} \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s})^{2}$.\nStep 7:  Simplifying this expression, we find that $E = 1.00 \\times 10^{-17} \\mathrm{~J}$.\nStep 8:  To express this energy in electronvolts (eV), we use the conversion factor $1 \\mathrm{~eV} = 1.60 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{~J}$.\nStep 9:  Dividing the energy in joules by this conversion factor, we get $E = \\frac{1.00 \\times 10^{-17} \\mathrm{~J}}{1.60 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{~J} / \\mathrm{eV}} = 6.25 \\mathrm{~eV}$.\nStep 10:  Therefore, the energy of the incident electron beam is $6.25 \\mathrm{~eV}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{6}$",

In this case, we want to find the MRS of software (S) for clothes (C).\n\nStep 2: To find the MRS, we need to take the partial derivatives of the utility function with respect to S and C. The partial derivative of U with respect to S is \u2202U/\u2202S = 4/S, and the partial derivative of U with respect to C is \u2202U/\u2202C = 6/C.\n\nStep 3: The MRS of software for clothes is given by the ratio of the partial derivative of U with respect to C to the partial derivative of U with respect to S.

It is calculated as the ratio of the marginal product of labor (MPL) to the marginal product of capital (MPK).\n\nStep 2: To find the MRTS of labor for capital, we need to first find the marginal products of labor and capital. The marginal product of labor (MPL) is the partial derivative of the production function with respect to labor (L), and the marginal product of capital (MPK) is the partial derivative of the production function with respect to capital (K).\n\nStep 3: The production function is given as $F(K, L)=(K-1)^{\\frac{1}{4}} L^{\\frac{1}{4}}$.
